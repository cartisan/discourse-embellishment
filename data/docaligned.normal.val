The Essjay controversy was an incident concerning a prominent Wikipedia participant and salaried Wikia employee , known by the username Essjay , who later identified himself as Ryan Jordan . Jordan held trusted volunteer positions within Wikipedia known as administrator , bureaucrat , arbitrator and mediator . In February 2007 , Jordan was found to have made false claims about his academic qualifications and professional experiences on his Wikipedia user page , and to journalist Stacy Schiff during an interview for The New Yorker , and to have exploited his supposed qualifications as leverage in internal disputes over Wikipedia content . The issues highlighted within the controversy included his falsification of a persona and qualifications , the impact of this deception on perceptions of Wikipedia -LRB- and its policies and credibility -RRB- , and the quality of decisions made in his promotion , support , and employment .
Reactions to the disclosure were diverse , encompassing commentary and articles in the electronic , print , and broadcast media ; the Wikipedia community researched Essjay 's article edits to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project 's handling of personal identification . In his editorial activities Jordan spent less time editing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes .
Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales initially supported Essjay 's use of a persona , saying , `` I regard it as a pseudonym and I do n't really have a problem with it . '' Later , Wales withdrew his support and asked for Essjay 's resignation from his positions with Wikipedia and Wikia . Wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned `` that Essjay used his false credentials in content disputes '' on Wikipedia .
Stacy Schiff , a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist writing for The New Yorker , interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about Wikipedia -LRB- `` Know It All '' ; July 31 , 2006 -RRB- after he was recommended to her by a member of the Wikimedia Foundation . According to The New Yorker , Essjay `` was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page . ''
During the interview , Jordan told The New Yorker and had previously stated on his Wikipedia user page that he held doctoral degrees in theology and canon law and worked as a tenured professor at a private university . It was later discovered that he was 24 years old , and had dropped out of community college with no qualifications . The New Yorker published a correction in February 2007 , which brought the issue to broader public attention .
The article said that Essjay spent some 14 hours or more a day on Wikipedia but was careful to keep his online life a secret from his colleagues and friends . It portrayed Essjay as often taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz . He asserted that he required anonymity to avoid cyberstalking .
Jordan , as Essjay , claimed he sent an email to a college professor using his invented persona 's credentials , vouching for Wikipedia 's accuracy . In the message he wrote in part , `` I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project Wikipedia . I am also a tenured professor of theology ; feel free to have a look at my Wikipedia user page -LRB- linked below -RRB- to gain an idea of my background and credentials . ''
When Essjay was hired by Wikia in January 2007 , he changed his Wikia profile and `` came clean on who he really was , '' identifying himself as Ryan Jordan . Other Wikipedia editors questioned Essjay on his Wikipedia talk page about the apparent discrepancy between his new Wikia profile and his previously claimed credentials . Essjay posted a detailed explanation in response to the first inquiry , stating that :
He later commented on his Wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by , '' ... doing a good job playing the part . ''
Social activist and Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then wrote a letter reporting the identity discrepancy to Stacy Schiff and The New Yorker . In late February 2007 , the magazine updated its article with a correction indicating that `` Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan , that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees , and that he has never taught . ''
On March 3 , 2007 , Andrew Lih , Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong , said on his blog that a portion of Essjay 's comments on the incident entered `` the dangerous domain of defamation and libel '' against Stacy Schiff . Lih quoted Essjay as writing on his Wikipedia talk page : `` Further , she -LRB- Schiff -RRB- made several offers to compensate me for my time , and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so , she should donate to the Foundation instead . '' Lih noted :
Lih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email . In it , Schiff stated that Essjay 's assertion was `` complete nonsense . ''
Speaking personally about Jordan , Wales said , `` Mr. Ryan was a friend , and still is a friend . He is a young man , and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology , which I have accepted . I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation . ''
Reaction from within the Wikipedia community to the Essjay\/Jordan identity discrepancy was sharp , voluminous , and mixed . While most editors denounced at least some of his actions , responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud .
As the controversy unfolded the Wikipedia community began a review of Essjay 's previous edits and some felt he had relied upon his fictional professorship to influence editorial consideration of edits he made . `` People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments , '' said Michael Snow , a Wikipedia administrator and founder of the Wikipedia community newspaper , The Wikipedia Signpost . `` Those will get looked at again . '' For instance , Essjay had recommended sources such as Catholicism for Dummies , a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church . Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur : `` This is a text I often require for my students , and I would hang my own Ph. D. on its credibility . '' In another case -LRB- a discussion of the liturgical use of the psalms -RRB- , he cited personal experience from `` the Abbey of Gethsemani , where I was a monk . ''
Wales was '' ... reported to be considering vetting all persons who adjudicate on factual disputes . '' `` I do n't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia , but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address , '' Wales added . He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished . `` We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition , so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle , '' Wales commented . However , he also warned that `` It 's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials , and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate . '' Wales argued `` contributors to the site who claim certain credentials will soon have to prove they really have them . '' However , Florence Devouard , chair of the Wikimedia Foundation , was not supportive of his credential proposal , saying , `` I think what matters is the quality of the content , which we can improve by enforcing policies such as ` cite your source , ' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor . '' A formal proposal that users claiming to have academic qualifications would have to provide evidence before citing them in content disputes was eventually rejected by the Wikipedia community , like all previous such proposals .
Wales expressed his regret that Essjay had `` made a series of very bad judgments . '' He also commented that he hoped Wikipedia would improve as a result of the controversy .
Andrew Orlowski , a frequent Wikipedia critic and writer for The Registerâ '' a British technology news and opinion websiteâ '' criticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture-capital-funded `` Wikia '' and for appointing him to the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee after Essjay had apparently admitted his previously claimed academic and professional credentials were false . Orlowski added that Essjay 's actions betrayed a dangerous community mindset within Wikipedia .
Others to comment adversely included ZDNet writer Mitch Ratcliffe , who asked `` why lying about one 's background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia , which proposes to help communities to record accurate information '' and asked for additional details `` such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing , as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements . ''
Larry Sanger , founding editor-in-chief of online encyclopedia Citizendium , and a co-founder of Wikipedia who left the project in 2002 , called Essjay 's response `` a defiant non-apology '' and elsewhere characterized Essjay 's actions as `` identity fraud . '' Citing comments by Essjay on his Wikipedia talk pages , Sanger asserted that other members of Wikipedia management , including Angela Beesley -LRB- co-founder of Wikia and a member of Wikimedia Foundation 's Communications Committee -RRB- and Brad Patrick -LRB- legal counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation -RRB- had participated in hiring Jordan despite their knowledge of the identity discrepancy . Sanger also implied that Jordan 's firing was purely the result of public outcry , and that `` Only after these sad facts were publicly exposed , only after there was a hue and cry , did Jimmy Wales decide to ask for Essjay 's resignation . ''
Following the media coverage of the Essjay controversy , a number of academics noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia . On March 2 , 2007 , a report in The Chronicle of Higher Education commented `` the incident is clearly damaging to Wikipedia 's credibilityâ '' especially with professors who will now note that one of the site 's most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud . '' Ross Brann , a professor of Judeo-Islamic studies at Cornell University in Ithaca , stated that Wikipedia lacks a process of scholarly review , saying , `` They could make up your life if they wanted to . '' Brann also said that Wikipedia `` has no place in the University , '' and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the unfavorable opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia . Students at Cornell indicated that they may continue to use Wikipedia as a quick source of information , though they would not cite it in scholarly work .
Nicola Pratt , a lecturer in international relations at the University of East Anglia in England stated , `` The ethos of Wikipedia is that anyone can contribute , regardless of status ... What 's relevant is their knowledge as judged by other readers , not whether they are professors or not â `` and the fact the student -LRB- Essjay -RRB- was exposed shows it works . ''
A resource room is a separate special education classroom in a regular school where some students with educational disabilities , such as specific learning disabilities , receive direct , specialized instruction and academic remediation and assistance with homework and related assignments as individuals or in small groups . These classrooms are staffed by special education teachers and sometimes educational assistants . The number of students in a resource room at a specific time varies from state , but generally consists of at most five students per teacher . Mainstreaming in education typically includes this service to students with special needs .
Special education teachers in a resource room focus on particular goals as mandated by an Individualized Education Program and remediate general education curriculum . Some programs emphasize the development of executive skills , including homework completion and behavior . Depending on individual needs , students usually attend resource rooms three to five times per week for about forty five minutes per day . Some research has suggested these classrooms are of particular benefit to students with language-based learning disabilities such as dyslexia . Other research has indicated that students show growth in visuo-motor perception , arithmetic , spelling and overall self-perception through time in the resource room classroom . Students using these services are typically considered included , rather than segregated or mainstreamed , because they attend other classes with their peers , especially at the secondary level . At least one study has suggested students with learning disabilities in resource rooms have higher expectations regarding their academic success when they are in the class . This may be due to the familiarity with the resource room teacher , small group Direct Instruction or confidence within an area they are comfortable in . Researchers believe that explicit instruction that breaks tasks down into smaller segments is an important tool for learning for students with learning disabilities . While some schools have decided against the concept of a resource room , opting instead to place special education teachers in general education classrooms , this approach can be deleterious to the student with special needs . However , when general education teachers utilize the small-group direct instruction and expertise of trained specialists the success can carry over to all classes . Students often benefit from `` reteaching '' of core concepts taught initially general education classroom and reinforced in resource rooms via the small-group instructional model , which has been shown to lead to achievement in students with a multitude of educational disabilities .
Resource rooms are classrooms where a special education teacher instructs and assists students identified with a disability . These students require special instruction in an individualized or small group setting for a portion of the day . Individual needs are supported in resource rooms as defined by the student 's IEP . The student getting this type of support will receive some time in the resource room which is referred to as ` removal from the regular education environment ' portion of the day and some time in the regular classroom with modifications and or accommodations which is specialized instruction with their non-disabled peers . Special education support within the regular education setting is part of the inclusion model .

The Finke River is one of the largest rivers in central Australia . Its source is in the Northern Territory 's MacDonnell Ranges , and the name Finke River is first applied at the confluence of the Davenport and Ormiston Creeks , just north of Glen Helen . From here the river meanders for approximately 600 km to the western edge of the Simpson Desert in northern South Australia . Usually the river is a string of waterholes , but it can become a raging torrent during rare flood events . In extreme events , water from the Finke River flows into the Macumba River , and thence into Lake Eyre , a total distance from headwater streams of around 750 km . Major tributaries include Ellery Creek , and the Palmer and Hugh Rivers . The Finke River flows through the West MacDonnell and Finke Gorge National Parks .
The Finke River was named by John McDouall Stuart in 1860 after an Adelaide man , William Finke , who was one of the promoters of his expedition . The indigenous name for the river in parts of the Northern Territory is Larapinta , which lends its name to Larapinta Drive , which runs west from Alice Springs , and the Larapinta walking trail .
The Finke River has long been cited as `` the oldest river in the world '' , particularly by tour operators , and in popular books and brochures . In places such as the James Range , the Finke flows through deeply incised meanders -LRB- see Google Maps image -RRB- . Because meanders only form on flat plains , the river must have formed before the ranges were pushed up ; this happened in a mountain building event referred to as the Alice Springs Orogeny which peaked between 400 and 300 million years age -LRB- Devonian to Carboniferous Periods -RRB- , . Therefore , some parts of the riverâ s course must have been already in existence around this time . But southern parts of its course must be much younger because the areas where the Finke now flows near the southern edge of the Northern Territory , and further south , were under the sea during the Mesozoic Era , part of the Great Artesian Basin .
The antiquity of the Finke River is not unique , but applies equally to other large mountain-sourced river systems in central Australia , e.g. the Todd and Hale Rivers and many others , because most of the central Australian mountain belts formed at around the same time . There are other eroded mountain ranges of equal or greater age to the MacDonnell Ranges , both in Australia and on other continents , so present rivers in those areas may have evolved from ancestral streams of equal and greater antiquity than the Finke .

The city is the second most populous in the metropolitan area .
The city was established in 1849 as an Army outpost on a bluff overlooking the Trinity River . Today Fort Worth still embraces its Western heritage and traditional architecture and design .
The faculty of reason -LRB- sometimes also called rationality or the faculty of discursive reason in opposition to `` intuitive reason '' -RRB- is a mental ability found in human beings and normally considered to be a definitive characteristic of human nature . It is closely associated with such human activities as language , science , art , mathematics and philosophy .
Reason , like habit or intuition , is a means by which thinking comes from one idea to a related idea . But more specifically , it is the way rational beings propose and consider explanations concerning cause and effect , true and false , and what is good or bad . In contrast to reason as an abstract noun , a reason is a consideration which explains or justifies some event , phenomenon or behavior . The ways in which human beings reason through an argument are the subject of inquiries in the field of logic .

Perpetual motion describes hypothetical machines that operate or produce useful work indefinitely and , more generally , hypothetical machines that produce more work or energy than they consume , whether they might operate indefinitely or not .
There is undisputed scientific consensus that perpetual motion would violate either the first law of thermodynamics , the second law of thermodynamics , or both . Machines which comply with both laws of thermodynamics but access energy from obscure sources are sometimes referred to as perpetual motion machines , although they do not meet the standard criteria for the name .
Despite the fact that successful perpetual motion devices are physically impossible in terms of our current understanding of the laws of physics , the pursuit of perpetual motion remains popular .
A Fanfare is a short piece of music played by trumpets and other brass instruments , frequently accompanied by percussion , usually for ceremonial purposes -LRB- usually for royalty or important people -RRB- . The term is also used symbolically , for instance of occasions for which there is much publicity , even when no music is involved .
Fanfares originated in the Middle Ages ; although popular depictions of ancient Rome frequently include fanfares , the evidence is slight . In 18th century France the fanfare was a movement with energy and repetition of notes , and fanfares of the modern description date from the 19th century , when they were composed for British coronations -LRB- such as Hubert Parry 's I was glad for Edward VII -RRB- and other important occasions .
Fanfares are popular as theme music for television and radio news programs . Additionally they are often used as victory marches in video games , particularly role playing games .
Fanfares are also frequently heard in military parades .

A metronome is any device that produces regular , metrical ticks -LRB- beats , clicks -RRB- â '' settable in beats per minute . These ticks represent a fixed , regular aural pulse ; some metronomes also include synchronized visual motion -LRB- e.g. pendulum-swing -RRB- . The metronome dates from the early 19th century , where it was patented by Johann Maelzel in 1815 as a tool for musicians , under the title `` Instrument\/Machine for the Improvement of all Musical Performance , called Metronome '' .
In the 20th century and esp . today the metronome is generally positively regarded in Europe and Western culture . The metronome is used by some musicians for practice in maintaining a consistent tempo with steady regular beats and it can be used by composers , as an approximate way of specifying the tempo .
Yet in stark contrasting with this postivistic view , research on the history of the metronome and its influence on performance practice , reveals criticisms of metronome use , and highlights differences of `` performance practice '' and cultural perception\/values between the current modern European\/Western society -LRB- which values the metronome -RRB- , and the same society during previous times -LRB- beginning of the 19th century and earlier : classical\/romantic\/baroque eras etc. -RRB- .
Accordingly , some musicians consider the metronome to be a highly controversial tool in regard to music , with some rejecting the metronome altogether . Some composers considering metronome-tempo-marks to have only little value , or to hinder creative musical interpretation : Johannes Brahms said : `` I am of the opinion that metronome marks go for nothing . As far as I know , all composers have , as I , retracted their metronome marks in later years . ''

Southwark -LRB- pronounced -RRB- is a district of London , England , UK , and the administrative headquarters of the London Borough of Southwark . Situated 1.5 m east of Charing Cross , it forms one of the oldest parts of central London and fronts the River Thames to the north . It historically formed an ancient borough in the county of Surrey , made up of a number of parishes , which increasingly came under the influence and jurisdiction of the City of London . As an inner district of London , Southwark experienced rapid depopulation during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . It is now at an advanced stage of regeneration and is the location of the City Hall offices of the Greater London Authority .
Southwark is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as Sudweca . The name means ` southern defensive work ' . It is formed from the Old English 's Å `` th ' and ` weorc ' . The southern location is in reference to the City of London to the north , Southwark being at the southern end of London Bridge . The name Suthriganaweorc is recorded for the area in the 10th century and means ` fort of the men of Surrey ' . The name has been used for various areas of civil administration , including the ancient Borough of Southwark , the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark and the current London Borough of Southwark . The ancient borough of Southwark was also known simply as The Borough and this nameâ '' or Boroughâ '' has persisted as an alternative name for the area . Southwark was simultaneously known as the Ward of Bridge Without from 1550 to 1978 .
Southwark is on a previously marshy area south of the River Thames . Recent excavation has revealed prehistoric activity including evidence of early ploughing , burial mounds and ritual activity . The area was originally a series of islands in the River Thames . This formed the best place to bridge the Thames and the area became an important part of Londinium owing its importance to its position as the endpoint of the Roman London Bridge . Two Roman roads , Stane Street and Watling Street , met at Southwark in what is now Borough High Street . Archaeological work at Tabard Street in 2004 discovered a plaque with the earliest reference to ` London ' from the Roman period on it . Londinium was abandoned at the end of the Roman occupation in the early fifth century and both the city and its bridge collapsed in decay . Archaeologically , evidence of settlement is replaced by a largely featureless soil called the Dark Earth which probably -LRB- although this is contested -RRB- represents an urban area abandoned .
`` Just Say No '' was an advertising campaign , part of the U.S. `` War on Drugs '' , prevalent during the 1980s and early 1990s , to discourage children from engaging in recreational drug use by offering various ways of saying no. .

A flywheel is a mechanical device with a significant moment of inertia used as a storage device for rotational energy . Flywheels resist changes in their rotational speed , which helps steady the rotation of the shaft when a fluctuating torque is exerted on it by its power source such as that caused by a piston-based -LRB- reciprocating -RRB- engine , or when an intermittent load , such as the motion of a piston pump , is placed on it .
Flywheels can be used to produce very high power pulses for experiments , where drawing the power from the public network would produce unacceptable spikes . A small motor can accelerate the flywheel between the pulses .
Recently , flywheels have become the subject of extensive research as power storage devices for uses in vehicles and power plants .
The principle of the flywheel is found in the Neolithic spindle and the potter 's wheel .

X-Men : The Last Stand -LRB- also known colloquially as X-Men 3 or X3 -RRB- is a 2006 superhero film and the third in the X-Men series . Director Brett Ratner took over when Bryan Singer dropped out to direct Superman Returns . The Last Stand revolves around a `` mutant cure '' that causes serious repercussions among mutants and humans , and on the mysterious resurrection of Jean Grey . The film is loosely based on two X-Men comic book story arcs : writer Chris Claremont 's and artist John Byrne 's `` The Dark Phoenix Saga '' and writer Joss Whedon 's and artist John Cassaday 's six-issue `` Gifted '' arc .
Following Singer 's departure , the director 's position was offered to Darren Aronofsky , Alex Proyas , Joss Whedon and Zack Snyder . Matthew Vaughn , who cast Kelsey Grammer as Beast and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut , dropped out during pre-production and was replaced by Ratner . Filming started in August 2005 , budgeted at $ 210 million , the most expensive film at the time of its release . X-Men : The Last Stand received mixed reviews from critics and fans , but grossed approximately $ 459 million worldwide , the seventh-highest grossing film of 2006 .
The pharmaceutical company Worthington Labs announces it has developed an inoculation to suppress the X-gene that gives mutants their powers and makes them different from other humans , offering the `` cure '' to any mutant who wants it . While some mutants are interested in the cure , including the X-Men 's Rogue , many others are horrified by the announcement . In response to the news , the X-Men 's adversary Magneto raises an army , warning his followers that the `` cure '' will be forcefully used to exterminate the mutant race .
Cyclops , still depressed about the loss of Jean Grey , returns to Alkali Lake . Jean appears to Cyclops , and as the two kiss , Jean changes and kills Cyclops . Sensing trouble , Professor Charles Xavier sends Wolverine and Storm to investigate . When they arrive , the two X-Men encounter telekinetically floating rocks , Cyclops ' glasses , and an unconscious Jean . Xavier explains that when Jean sacrificed herself , she unleashed the powerful alternate personality she calls `` Phoenix '' . Wolverine is disgusted to learn that Xavier has kept Jean in check telepathically , but when Jean awakens , he realizes she is not the Jean Grey he knew . Jean pleads with Wolverine to kill her , but when he refuses , the Phoenix surfaces and telekinetically slams Wolverine into a wall . She then escapes to her childhood home .
Magneto , also aware that Jean is now a powerful mutant , meets Xavier at Jean 's house . The two men vie for Jean 's loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces , unleashing her devastating power . She destroys her family 's house , disintegrates Xavier , and leaves with Magneto . Following the loss of Xavier , the X-Men regroup and confront Magneto 's army , which is attacking the pharmaceutical company . During the fight , Beast injects Magneto with the `` cure '' , nullifying his mutant powers . After the battle , the Phoenix emerges and begins to destroy everything around her . Momentarily gaining control , Jean begs Wolverine to save her . Telling Jean he loves her , Wolverine reluctantly kills her with his claws .
The school continues without Xavier , with Storm now as headmistress and Logan as a teacher ; the President appoints Beast as ambassador to the United Nations ; Rogue returns , telling Iceman she has taken the `` cure . '' The underpowered Magneto sits at a chessboard in a park and reaches out toward a metal chess piece that moves slightly , indicating that the mutant cure may possibly be only temporary . Following the end credits , Dr. Moira MacTaggert checks on a comatose patient who greets her with Xavier 's voice . Startled , she replies , `` Charles ? ''
The X-Men are a special ops team from The Xavier Institute , charged with protecting both humans and mutants and trying to prevent a war between the two .
The Brotherhood is Magneto 's personal strike force , whose goal is to ensure mutant supremacy .
A group of mutant outcasts which exists as part of an underground network that stretches across the nation .
X-Men co-creator Stan Lee and writer Chris Claremont have cameos in the film 's opening scene as neighbors in Jean Grey 's old neighborhood . Respectively , they are credited as `` Waterhose man '' and `` Lawnmower man '' . The sergeant directing defensive preparations before the Brotherhood assaults Alcatraz Island is played by R. Lee Ermey . Despite playing a key role in the secret ending and depicted as having close personal ties to Professor Xavier , Moira MacTaggert , portrayed by Olivia Williams , was not listed in the official press notes ' cast list and goes uncredited in the finished film .
Bryan Singer , the director of the first two X-Men films , left the project in July 2004 in favor of developing Superman Returns . He was joined by X2 screenwriters Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty , as well as John Ottman , composer and editor of the film . Though Singer , Harris and Dougherty did not produce a completed script , Singer revealed that at the time of his departure they had partially written a story treatment focusing on Jean Grey 's resurrection , which would also introduce the villain Emma Frost , a role intended for Sigourney Weaver . Frost was an empath manipulating Jean 's emotions in the treatment , and like the finished film Magneto desires to control her . Overwhelmed by her powers , Jean kills herself , but Jean 's spirit survives and becomes a god-like creature , which Dougherty compared to the star child in A Space Odyssey .
New contracts for returning cast members were made as the actors previously signed for only two films . Hugh Jackman 's contract included the approval of director , initially offering the position to Darren Aronofsky , with whom he had just finished filming on The Fountain . Joss Whedon , whose comic book `` Gifted '' having been integrated in the script 's plot , turned down the offer because he was working on a Wonder Woman film . Rob Bowman and Alex Proyas were also rumored , though Proyas personally turned it down , citing feuds with Fox president Thomas Rothman on I , Robot . Zack Snyder was also approached , but he was already committed to 300 . In February 2005 , with still no director hired , Fox announced a May 5 , 2006 release date , with filming to start in July 2005 . They later pushed the release date three weeks for Memorial Day weekend , and signed Matthew Vaughn to direct in March 2005 . Vaughn cast Kelsey Grammer as Beast and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut , but family issues led him to withdraw before filming began . Vaughn was also cautious of Fox wanting to rush production . `` I did n't have the time to make the movie that I wanted to make . I had a vision for how it should be , '' Vaughn reflected in a 2007 interview , `` and I wanted to make sure I was making a film as good as X-Men 2 , and I knew there was no way it could be . ''
Brett Ratner , who was previously considered as the director for X-Men in 1996 , replaced Vaughn during pre-production . On June 13 , 2005 , a review of an incomplete early draft of the screenplay posted by Drew McWeeny from Ai n't It Cool News sparked controversy from fans , due to certain main characters ' storylines ; however , that was the very first of over two dozen drafts of the script . Most notably the Golden Gate Bridge sequence was originally in the middle of the film , but Ratner decided it would create a more dramatic climax if moved to the end , which was originally to take place in Washington , D.C. Mutants were initially held on Alcatraz as prisoners , but Ratner changed the bridge escape in the middle to highlight the Dark Phoenix rising scene in the climax . He also expanded Halle Berry 's role as Storm . The actress stated during interviews for X2 that she would not return unless the character had a significant presence comparable to the comic book version . Maggie Grace was considered for Kitty Pryde before Ratner cast Ellen Page . He was impressed with her performance in Hard Candy and did not require an audition .
Simon Kinberg was hired as writer for X-Men 3 in August 2004 , and was joined by Zak Penn in January 2005 . Kinberg wanted `` The Dark Phoenix Saga '' to be the emotional plot of the film , while `` Gifted '' would serve as the political focus . Killing Cyclops was Fox 's decision , based on the availability of actor James Marsden , who was cast in Singer 's Superman Returns . The studio considered killing him off-screen with a dialogue reference , but Kinberg and Penn insisted that Jean kill him , emphasizing their relationship . Xavier 's death was intended to match the impact of Spock 's demise in Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , as Fox felt the script called for a dramatic turning point . Kinberg and Penn were originally cautious but grew to like the idea of killing off Xavier . They decided to write a post-credits scene suggesting the character 's return for a sequel .
As the studio was simultaneously developing X-Men Origins : Wolverine , limitations were set on which mutants could be used for cameo appearances in X-Men 3 in an attempt to avoid risking character development for Wolverine . Gambit initially appeared in the Battle of Alcatraz climax with the X-Men , but the writers did not want to introduce a fan favorite character and `` not be able to do him justice . '' Kinberg reasoned `` there just was n't enough space . '' Alan Cumming had been uncomfortable with the long hours he had to take with the prosthetic makeup as Nightcrawler in X2 , but still planned to return for the sequel . The part for Nightcrawler was so minimal , however , that the studio felt it was not worthwhile to go through the long and costly makeup process , and the character was cut . Kinberg felt that `` there was n't much left to do with the character . It also felt like he might tread a little bit on the terrain of Beast ; in terms of similarities in the characters and their political standpoints in terms of dealing with their mutancy . '' Nightcrawler 's absence was later explained in the tie-in video game .
X-Men : The Last Stand began shooting in August 2005 and ended in January 2006 . Much of the film was shot at Vancouver Film Studios in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada . Locations included the Hatley Park National Historic Site and Royal Roads University , which doubled for the X-Mansion . According to associate producer Dave Gordon , `` This is the biggest production ever filmed in Canada . It used to be X2 , now it 's X3 . '' The $ 210 million budget also made The Last Stand the most expensive film to be made at the time . The film 's record would be first broken by Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man 's Chests $ 225 million budget . Fox Filmed Entertainment co-chairmen Thomas Rothman and Jim Gianopulos debated whether Rogue should give Iceman a passionate kiss at the film 's end or simply hold his hand . The two executives screened The Last Stand for their daughters as well as the studio 's female marketing executives , and the hand holding prevailed . Gianopulos stated that the kissing `` was all about sex , and we did n't want that . ''

279 Thule is a large main-belt asteroid . It is classified as a D-type asteroid and is probably composed of organic-rich silicates , carbon and anhydrous silicates .
The orbit of Thule is unusual . It appears to orbit in the outermost edge of the main belt in a 3:4 orbital resonance with planet Jupiter . Unlike the Hilda asteroids , whose eccentricity is fairly typical of main-belt asteroids , Thule has a very low eccentricity â `` actually much lower than that of Jupiter itself and only slightly higher than that of Earth .
Some astronomers have argued that Thule 's present orbit is the natural result of the force of Jupiter on a body orbiting at precisely the distance from the Sun Thule does , in the same way -LRB- though with the reverse effect -RRB- as the Kirkwood gaps in the more inner parts of the asteroid belt . It could thus be that the resonance which holds Thule in an extremely low-eccentricity orbit serves to eject other smaller bodies whose distance from the Sun is only slightly different from that of Thule itself .
Thule was the first discovered member of the Thule dynamical group which as of 2008 is known to consist of three objects : 279 Thule , , and .
It was discovered by Johann Palisa on October 25 , 1888 in Vienna and was named aptly after the ultimate northern land of Thule .

Classical economics is widely regarded as the first modern school of economic thought . Its major developers include Adam Smith , Jean-Baptiste Say , David Ricardo , Thomas Malthus and John Stuart Mill .
Adam Smith 's The Wealth of Nations in 1776 is usually considered to mark the beginning of classical economics . The school was active into the mid 19th century and was followed by neoclassical economics in Britain beginning around 1870 , or , in Marx 's definition by `` vulgar political economy '' from the 1830s . The definition of classical economics is debated , particularly the period 1830 â `` 70 and the connection to neoclassical economics . The term `` classical economics '' was coined by Karl Marx to refer to Ricardian economics â `` the economics of David Ricardo and James Mill and their predecessors â `` but usage was subsequently extended to include the followers of Ricardo .
The classical economists produced their `` magnificent dynamics '' during a period in which capitalism was emerging from feudalism and in which the industrial revolution was leading to vast changes in society . These changes raised the question of how a society could be organized around a system in which every individual sought his or her own -LRB- monetary -RRB- gain . Classical political economy is popularly associated with the idea that free markets can regulate themselves .
Classical economists and their immediate predecessors reoriented economics away from an analysis of the ruler 's personal interests to broader national interests . Adam Smith , and also physiocrat Francois Quesnay , for example , identified the wealth of a nation with the yearly national income , instead of the king 's treasury . Smith saw this income as produced by labor , land , and capital . With property rights to land and capital held by individuals , the national income is divided up between labourers , landlords , and capitalists in the form of wages , rent , and interest or profits .

The Glossy-mantled Manucode , Manucodia ater , is a medium-sized , around 42 cm long , glossed green , blue and purple black bird of paradise with a red iris , black bill , long graduated tail and somewhat elongated upper breast and neck feathers . Both sexes are similar . The female is a slightly smaller than the male .
In appearance , the Glossy-mantled Manucode resembles and is difficult to distinguished from its nearest relatives , the Crinkle-collared and Jobi Manucodes . It is widely distributed throughout the lowlands of New Guinea and nearby islands . The diet consists mainly of fruits , figs and arthropods .
The Glossy-mantled Manucode was the first bird of paradise encountered by the French naturalist RenÃ - PrimevÃ re Lesson , the first westerner to see live wild birds of paradise .
The Haitian Revolution -LRB- 1791 â `` 1804 -RRB- was a period of conflict in the French colony of Saint-Domingue , which culminated in the elimination of slavery there and the founding of the Haitian republic . Although hundreds of rebellions occurred in the New World during the centuries of slavery , only the St. Domingue Slave Revolt , which began in 1791 , was successful in achieving permanent independence under a new nation . The Haitian Revolution is regarded as a defining moment in the history of Africans in the New World .
Alexander Selkirk -LRB- 1676 â `` 13 December 1721 -RRB- was a Scottish sailor who spent four years as a castaway when he was marooned on an uninhabited island . It is probable that his travels provided the inspiration for Daniel Defoe 's novel Robinson Crusoe .

The Parthenon Marbles , known also as the Elgin Marbles , are a collection of classical Greek marble sculptures -LRB- mostly by Phidias and his pupils -RRB- , inscriptions and architectural members that originally were part of the Parthenon and other buildings on the Acropolis of Athens . Thomas Bruce , 7th Earl of Elgin , the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1799 â `` 1803 , had obtained a controversial permission from the Ottoman authorities to remove pieces from the Acropolis .
From 1801 to 1812 Elgin 's agents removed about half of the surviving sculptures of the Parthenon , as well as architectural members and sculpture from the Propylaea and Erechtheum . The Marbles were transported by sea to Britain . In Britain , the acquisition of the collection was supported by some , while other critics compared Elgin 's actions to vandalism or looting .

In cryptography , a Feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers , named after the German-born physicist and cryptographer Horst Feistel who did pioneering research while working for IBM -LRB- USA -RRB- ; it is also commonly known as a Feistel network . A large proportion of block ciphers use the scheme , including the Data Encryption Standard -LRB- DES -RRB- . The Feistel structure has the advantage that encryption and decryption operations are very similar , even identical in some cases , requiring only a reversal of the key schedule . Therefore the size of the code or circuitry required to implement such a cipher is nearly halved .
A Feistel network is an iterated cipher with an internal function called a round function .
Feistel networks were first seen commercially in IBM 's Lucifer cipher , designed by Horst Feistel and Don Coppersmith . Feistel networks gained respectability when the U.S. Federal Government adopted the DES -LRB- a cipher based on Lucifer , with changes made by the NSA -RRB- . Like other components of the DES , the iterative nature of the Feistel construction makes implementing the cryptosystem in hardware easier -LRB- particularly on the hardware available at the time of DES ' design -RRB- .
Many modern and also some old symmetric block ciphers are based on Feistel networks -LRB- e.g. GOST 28147-89 block cipher -RRB- , and the structure and properties of Feistel ciphers have been extensively explored by cryptographers . Specifically , Michael Luby and Charles Rackoff analyzed the Feistel cipher construction , and proved that if the round function is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom function , with Ki used as the seed , then 3 rounds is sufficient to make the block cipher a pseudorandom permutation , while 4 rounds is sufficient to make it a `` strong '' pseudorandom permutation -LRB- which means that it remains pseudorandom even to an adversary who gets oracle access to its inverse permutation -RRB- .
Because of this very important result of Luby and Rackoff , Feistel ciphers are sometimes called Luby-Rackoff block ciphers . Further theoretical work has generalized the construction somewhat , and given more precise bounds for security .
Let be the round function and let be the sub-keys for the rounds respectively .
One advantage of the Feistel model compared to a substitution-permutation network is that the round function does not have to be invertible .
The diagram illustrates both encryption and decryption . Note the reversal of the subkey order for decryption ; this is the only difference between encryption and decryption .
Unbalanced Feistel ciphers use a modified structure where and are not of equal lengths . The Skipjack encryption algorithm is an example of such a cipher . The Texas Instruments Digital Signature Transponder uses a proprietary unbalanced Feistel cipher to perform challenge-response authentication .
The Thorp shuffle is an extreme case of an unbalanced Feistel cipher in which one side is a single bit . This has better provable security than a balanced Feistel cipher but requires more rounds .
The Feistel construction is also used in cryptographic algorithms other than block ciphers . For example , the Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding -LRB- OAEP -RRB- scheme uses a simple Feistel network to randomize ciphertexts in certain asymmetric key encryption schemes .

Wubi -LRB- Windows-based UBuntu Installer -RRB- is an official Windows-based free software installer for Ubuntu . Wubi was born as an independent project and as such versions 7.04 and 7.10 were unofficial releases .
Since 8.04 the code has been merged within Ubuntu and since 8.04 alpha 5 , Wubi can also be found in the Ubuntu Live CD . The goal of the project is to assist a Windows user unacquainted with Linux in trying Ubuntu without risking any loss of information due to disk formatting or partitioning .
Ecclesiastical polity is the operational and governance structure of a church or Christian denomination . It also denotes the ministerial structure of the church and the authority relationships between churches . Polity is closely related to Ecclesiology , the study of doctrine and theology relating to church organization .

Inorganic chemistry is the branch of chemistry concerned with the properties and behavior of inorganic compounds . This field covers all chemical compounds except the myriad organic compounds -LRB- carbon based compounds , usually containing C-H bonds -RRB- , which are the subjects of organic chemistry . The distinction between the two disciplines is far from absolute , and there is much overlap , most importantly in the sub-discipline of organometallic chemistry .
Many inorganic compounds are ionic compounds , consisting of cations and anions joined by ionic bonding . Examples of salts are magnesium chloride MgCl2 , which consists of magnesium cations Mg2 + and chloride anions Clâ ' ; or sodium oxide Na2O , which consists of sodium cations Na + and oxide anions O2 â ' . In any salt , the proportions of the ions are such that the electric charges cancel out , so that the bulk compound is electrically neutral . The ions are described by their oxidation state and their ease of formation can be inferred from the ionization potential -LRB- for cations -RRB- or from the electron affinity -LRB- anions -RRB- of the parent elements .
JimanÃ is the capital and the second largest city of the Independencia Province of the Dominican Republic . It serves as one of the two main thoroughfares to Haiti -LRB- with DajabÃ n -RRB- , with a duty free open air marketplace operating on the border with the Haitian town of Malpasse . Half of the town was completely washed away in the flash flood of May 25 , 2004 , killing many of the citizens during the night . It is still in the process of rebuilding .
Of the first inhabitants we have the reference that they have origin in the different communities of the southwest as : Neiba , DuvergÃ , El Estero , Las Salinas , Azua de Compostela , Santa Cruz de Barahona and other communities , without stop citing the Haitian immigrants that married or amancebaron with Dominicans and Dominican , forming families in which is the most populous neighborhood of the community , and the one that is known as JimanÃ Viejo .
For the decade of the 1930 , JimanÃ belonged to Neyba and in 1938 , passed to be section of the common one of La Descubierta one and DuvergÃ , forming meetings , part from of the Province of Neiba , the one that today is Province Baoruco . It fits to emphasize , that for that epoch JimanÃ was not recognized by the historians , since not even figured in the map of the Dominican Republic , appearing only the White Stream populations Arroyo Blanco y La Furnia
For the epoch in question , JimanÃ had entered a moment in which the dictator Rafael L. Trujillo Molina , had planned strategically a program for `` dominicanizar '' all the frontier region , for which being part of the location , applied the call eviction , moment known like the killing of Haitians and repatriation in the 1937 . After passing for a light phase of development , in 1943 , JimanÃ is raised to the category of Municipal District by means of the law # 229 of the above-mentioned year , belonging to the common one of The Discovered one . In 1948 , it was done JimanÃ municipality , being proposed the head of state Rafael L. Trujillo Molina , to become a city more beautiful and magnificent ; is when they are built more you marry of concrete , the ones that were lived by soldiers and public officials , that mostly were brought of the interior of the country , upon not there being the sufficient personnel qualified to assume the public responsibilities , this reinforced by illiteracy index a reduction in the community .
The name `` XIMANI '' , is of native origin . In such sense , the Dr. Rafael Leonidas PÃ rez and PÃ rez in his book ; `` Annotations on the history of JimanÃ '' , says that this was an overlord of the chieftainship of Jaragua -LRB- Xaragua -RRB- that had the controls of these lands . Although another version on this name relating to the count of French origin exists -LRB- Count of JimanÃ -RRB- , the historian clarifies that this official of the epoch , him he was called thus exactly by to have lived in this place , name that by logic , already he was very old . He notifies that the name of JimanÃ -LRB- XimanÃ -RRB- , himself due to the overlord , not to the count .
The agriculture and the commerce with Haiti represent the main economic activities of this Municipality . In agriculture the main products are cassava , batata , melon , peppers , cilantro and tomatoes .
In the trade relation with the neighboring country , a free commerce is carried out , to which the inhabitants respond not only of JimanÃ and the adjoining towns , but people of different towns and far away regions of this zone .
The door , like him is called to the customs zone in the border , is visited also by foreign tourists , that come to observe the dynamics of the business and of the relation intercultural and interracial between Dominicans and Haitian .
Shabbat -LRB- , Ashkenazi pronunciation : Shabbos , Yiddish : ` , , in English : the Sabbath , `` rest '' or `` cessation '' -RRB- is the seventh day of the Jewish week and a day of rest in Judaism . Shabbat is observed from a few minutes before sunset on Friday evening until a few minutes after the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night . The exact times , therefore , differ from week to week and from place to place , depending on the time of sunset at each location . In polar areas where there is no sunrise or sunset at certain times of the year , a different set of rules applies .
On Shabbat Jews recall the Biblical Creation account in Genesis , describing God creating the Heavens and the Earth in six days and resting on the seventh . It also recalls the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai , when God commanded the Israelite nation to observe the seventh day and keep it holy .
Shabbat is considered a festive day , when a Jew is freed from the regular labors of everyday life , can contemplate the spiritual aspects of life , and can spend time with family . Traditionally , three festive meals are eaten : on Friday night , Saturday morning , and late Saturday afternoon . The day is also noted for those activities prohibited on Shabbat according to halakha -LRB- Jewish law -RRB- .
The word Shabbat derives from the Hebrew verb shavat . Although frequently translated as `` rest '' -LRB- noun or verb -RRB- , another accurate translation of these words is `` ceasing -LRB- from work -RRB- '' , as resting is not necessarily denoted . The related modern Hebrew word shevita , -LRB- labor strike -RRB- , has the same implication of active rather than passive abstinence from work . The notion of active cessation from labor is also regarded as more consistent with an omnipotent God 's activity on the seventh day of Creation according to Genesis .
Shabbat is given special status as a holy day at the very beginning of the Torah in . It is first commanded after the Exodus from Egypt , in -LRB- relating to the cessation of manna -RRB- and in -LRB- as the fourth of the Ten Commandments -RRB- . Shabbat is commanded and commended many more times in the Torah and Tanakh ; special sacrifices are to be offered on the day . Shabbat is also described by the prophets Isaiah , Jeremiah , Ezekiel , Hosea , Amos , and Nehemiah .
The nucleolus -LRB- also called nucleole -RRB- is a non-membrane bound structure composed of proteins and nucleic acids found within the nucleus . Ribosomal RNA -LRB- rRNA -RRB- is transcribed and assembled within the nucleolus . The nucleolus ultrastructure can be visualized through an electron microscope , while the organization and dynamics can be studied through fluorescent protein tagging and fluorescent recovery after photobleaching -LRB- FRAP -RRB- . Malfunction of nucleoli can be the cause for several human diseases .
Three major components of the nucleolus are recognized : the fibrillar centers -LRB- FC -RRB- , the dense fibrillar component -LRB- DFC -RRB- , and granular components -LRB- GC -RRB- . However , it has been proposed that this particular organization is only observed in higher eukaryotes and that it evolved from a bipartite organization with the transition from anamniotes to amniotes . Reflecting the substantial increase in the DNA intergenic region , an original fibrillar component would have separated into the FC and the DFC . Another structure identified within many nucleoli -LRB- particularly in plants -RRB- is a clear area in the center of the structure referred to as a nucleolar vacuole .
Dixon is a city in Lee County , Illinois , United States . The population was 15,941 as of the 2000 census . Named for its founder , John Dixon -LRB- Dixon 's Ferry -RRB- , it is the county seat of Lee County . Located on the Rock River , Dixon was the boyhood home of former U.S. President Ronald Reagan .
Margaret of Valois -LRB- French : Marguerite de France , Marguerite de Valois , 14 May 1553 -- 27 March 1615 -RRB- was Queen of France and of Navarre during the late sixteenth century . Royal Princess of France by birth , she ultimately became the only surviving member of the Royal Valois dynasty .
She was the daughter of King Henry II of France and Catherine de ' Medici and the sister of Kings Francis II , Charles IX and Henry III and of Queen Elizabeth of Spain . She was queen twice for she had married King Henry III of Navarre who finally became King Henri IV of France .
Margaret , among other political manipulations , was subjected to an arranged marriage and being held prisoner -LRB- albeit at a castle -RRB- for many years . However , her life was anything but passive .
Breaking Dawn is the fourth and final novel in the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer . Divided into three parts , the first and third sections are written from Bella Swan 's perspective and the second is written from the perspective of Jacob Black . Breaking Dawn was released on August 2 , 2008 at midnight release parties in over 4,000 bookstores throughout the US . From its initial print run of 3.7 million copies , 1.3 million were sold in the first 24 hours of the book 's release , setting a record in first-day sales performance for the Hachette Book Group USA .
Breaking Dawn is split into three separate parts . The first part details Bella 's marriage and honeymoon with Edward , which they spend on a private island , called Isle Esme , off the coast of Brazil . Two weeks into their honeymoon , Bella realizes that she is pregnant with a half-vampire child and that her condition is progressing at an unnaturally accelerated rate . After contacting Carlisle , who confirms her pregnancy , she and Edward immediately return home to Forks , Washington . Edward , concerned for Bella 's life and convinced that the fetus is a monster as it continues to develop with unnatural rapidity , urges her to have an abortion . However , Bella feels a connection with her unborn baby and refuses .
The novel 's second part is written from the perspective of shape-shifter Jacob Black , and lasts throughout Bella 's pregnancy and childbirth . Jacob 's Quileute wolf pack , not knowing what danger the unborn child may pose , plan to destroy it , also killing Bella . Jacob vehemently protests this decision and leaves , forming his own pack with Leah and Seth Clearwater . Bella soon gives birth , but the baby breaks many of her bones and she loses massive amounts of blood . In order to save her life , Edward changes her into a vampire by injecting his venom into her heart . Jacob , who was present for the birth , almost immediately `` imprints '' â '' an involuntary response in which a shape-shifter finds his soul mateâ '' on Edward and Bella 's newborn daughter , Renesmee .
The third section of Breaking Dawn shifts back to Bella 's perspective , finding her changed into a vampire and enjoying her new life and abilities . However , the vampire Irina misidentifies Renesmee as an `` immortal child '' , a child who has been turned into a vampire . Because `` immortal children '' are uncontrollable , creating them has been outlawed by the Volturi . After Irina presents her allegation to the Volturi , they plan to destroy Renesmee and the Cullens . In an attempt to survive , the Cullens gather other vampire clans from around the world to stand as witnesses and prove to the Volturi that Renesmee is not an immortal child . Upon confronting the gathered Cullen allies and witnesses , the Volturi discover that they have been misinformed and immediately execute Irina for her mistake . However , they remain undecided on whether Renesmee should be viewed as a threat to vampires ' secret existence . At that time , Alice and Jasper , who had left prior to the confrontation , return with a Mapuche called Nahuel , a 150-year-old vampire-human crossbreed like Renesmee . Nahuel demonstrates that the crossbreeds pose no threat , and the Volturi leave . Edward , Bella , and Renesmee return to their home in peace .
The title , Breaking Dawn , is a reference to the beginning of Bella 's life as a newborn vampire . The cover is a metaphor for Bella 's progression throughout the entire series ; she began as the physically weakest player on the board , the pawn , but at the end she becomes the strongest , the queen .
The plays The Merchant of Venice and A Midsummer Night 's Dream both influenced Breaking Dawn . Originally , Meyer wrote a book titled Forever Dawn , which was a direct sequel to Twilight . While the basic storyline remained the same , Forever Dawn was narrated completely from Bella 's point of view , the werewolves and Jacob were `` only sketchily developed '' , Victoria and Laurent were both alive , and there was an epilogue . Meyer went on to say that she `` may post some extras someday if I ever have time to go back through the Forever Dawn manuscriptâ '' it 's just as long as Breaking Dawn . ''
In regard to Renesmee 's unique name , Meyer wrote that she `` could n't call her Jennifer or Ashley . What do you name the most unique baby in the world ? I looked through a lot of baby name websites . Eventually I realized that there was no human name that was going to work for me , so I surrendered to necessity and made up my own . '' Meyer decided to include the pregnancy in her story while she was researching vampires and came across the legend of the incubus , a demon who could father children .
Entertainment Weekly magazine released an excerpt of Breaking Dawn on May 30 , 2008 . Stephenie Meyer also revealed a ` Quote of the Day ' from Breaking Dawn for about three weeks prior to its August 2 , 2008 release . The first quote was released on Stephenie 's website on July 12 , 2008 . The first chapter of Breaking Dawn , `` Engaged '' , was released in the special edition of Eclipse . Breaking Dawn was officially released on August 2 , 2008 through midnight release parties in over 4,000 bookstores , most of which involved costume and trivia contests , crafts , and face painting .
Godiva also made a Twilight-themed chocolate bar , which was released in Barnes & Noble book stores at the release parties . A four-city Breaking Dawn Concert Series , featuring Stephenie Meyer and Blue October 's Justin Furstenfeld , coincided with the novel 's release . The concert series sold out three of its four locations on the day that tickets went on sale , selling out in under an hour in one city .
Prior to the novel 's release , the first three Twilight books had already sold 8.5 million copies throughout the US and over 2 million copies in the UK . Breaking Dawn was one of the most anticipated books of 2008 with The Guardian noting , `` Teenagers across the world are anxiously awaiting the next instalment of author Stephenie Meyer 's vampiric series of novels . '' To meet the high demand , Little , Brown Books added a printing of 500,000 additional copies just prior to publication of the title , bringing initial print run to 3.7 million .
The book sold 1.3 million copies in the US and 20,000 copies in the UK in its first 24 hours of release , as well as 100,000 copies in Canada during its first weekend . Breaking Dawn debuted at # 1 on USA Todays top 150 best sellers list and has gone on to spend over 58 weeks on the list . It was also the biggest-selling children 's book of 2008 with over 6 million copies sold .
A special edition of Breaking Dawn was released on August 4 , 2009 , containing a DVD of the Breaking Dawn Concert Series and an interview with Meyer .
Reception of Breaking Dawn was , at best , `` mixed '' . Lev Grossman wrote , `` First , since there 's a lot of one-star reviews up on Amazon , let me say up front : I loved Breaking Dawn . '' Cara von Wrangel Kinsey of School Library Journal responded with a positive review , describing the book as `` captivating '' and noting , `` While this novel is darker and more mature than the earlier titles , Meyer 's twists and turns are not out of character . '' The Charlotte Observer agreed and called the book `` pretty darned good '' , but criticized the book 's length saying , `` I wish -LRB- Stephenie Meyer -RRB- had n't felt compelled to pack so much into one volume . It should have been two books . '' Mary Harris Russell of the Chicago Tribune also responded with a positive review and hailed the book as a `` fun read '' , noting that Stephenie Meyer `` continues to produce witty writing about families , teenagers and popular culture '' , while Time called the book `` a wild but satisfying finish to the ballad of Bella and Edward '' and gave it a rating of A - . An article in The Daily News Tribune said of Breaking Dawn , `` Some of the dialog is a bit stilted , ... but , if you stay close to Meyer 's rich and prodigious narrative , you too might fall in love with its suspense and moving sensitivity '' .
Publishers Weekly stated that the main problem with Breaking Dawn was that , `` Essentially , everyone gets everything they want , even if their desires necessitate an about-face in characterization or the messy introduction of some back story . Nobody has to renounce anything or suffer more than temporarilyâ '' in other words , grandeur is out . '' In an article by The Associated Press , journalist Sara Rose wrote on NewsOK.com that fans of the series would love `` engaging characters , great humor , a distracting obsession with beauty , focus on the minutiae of emotions '' ; however `` casual readers may be disappointed with a lot of build-up and little action . '' The Independent called the book , `` shockingly , tackily , sick-makingly sexist '' and said that `` Bella Swan lives to serve men and suffer . '' Entertainment Weekly graded Breaking Dawn with a D , criticizing the birth scene and Bella 's `` unwavering passion for Edward '' and having no other goals . The Washington Post also responded with a negative review , making comments such as , `` Meyer has put a stake through the heart of her own beloved creation , '' and `` Breaking Dawn has a childbirth sequence that may promote lifelong abstinence in sensitive types . ''
In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Meyer responded to the negative response of many fans to the book and called it the `` Rob Effect '' ; she said that the fans need time to accept the ending of Breaking Dawn , just as they needed time to accept Robert Pattinson playing the role of Edward in the Twilight movie .
Breaking Dawn was the recipient of a British Book Award for `` Children 's Book of the Year '' . In the 2009 `` Children 's Choice Book Awards '' , the novel was chosen as `` Teen Choice Book of the Year '' and Meyer won the `` Author of the Year '' award .
Summit Entertainment announced in November 2008 that they had obtained the rights to the fourth book in Stephenie Meyer 's series , Breaking Dawn . The studio greenlit an adaptation of The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn in April 2010 . The film is to be split into two parts , the first of which is scheduled for release on November 18 , 2011 . Then , on Friday , August 6th , 2010 , Summit Entertainment announced that the second part of the movie will be theatrically released on November 16 , 2012 . Bill Condon will be directing both parts ; The Twilight Saga author , Stephenie Meyer , will co-produce the film along with Karen Rosenfelt and Wyck Godfrey . In July 2010 , Summit announced that the movie will be shot in Vancouver , Canada , and Baton Rouge , Louisiana . Actress Maggie Grace has signed on to play the part of Irina in the movie , and Mackenzie Foy has signed on to play Renesmee , Edward and Bella 's half vampire half human child .
The Battle of Bosworth Field -LRB- or the Battle of Bosworth -RRB- was the penultimate battle of the Wars of the Roses , the civil war between the House of Lancaster and the House of York that raged across England in the latter half of the 15th century . Fought on 22 August 1485 , the battle was won by the Lancastrians . Their leader Henry Tudor , Earl of Richmond , became the first English monarch of the Tudor dynasty by his victory and subsequent marriage to a Yorkist princess . His opponent Richard III , the last king of the House of York , was killed in the battle . Historians consider Bosworth Field to mark the end of the Plantagenet dynasty , making it one of the defining moments of English history .
Decaffeination is the act of removing caffeine from coffee beans , cocoa , tea leaves and other caffeine-containing materials . -LRB- While caffeine-free soft drinks are occasionally referred to as `` decaffeinated '' , some are better termed `` uncaffeinated '' : prepared without adding caffeine during production . -RRB- Despite removal of caffeine , many decaffeinated drinks still have around 1-2 % of the original caffeine remaining in them .
In the case of coffee , various methods can be used . The process is usually performed on unroasted -LRB- green -RRB- beans , and starts with steaming of the beans . They are then rinsed with a solvent that extracts the caffeine while leaving the other essential chemicals in the coffee beans . The process is repeated anywhere from 8 to 12 times until it meets either the international standard of having removed 97 % of the caffeine in the beans or the EU standard of having the beans 99.9 % caffeine-free by mass. . Coffee contains over 400 chemicals important to the taste and aroma of the final drink : it is therefore challenging to remove only caffeine while leaving the other chemicals at their original concentrations .
Coffea arabica normally contains about half the caffeine of Coffea robusta . A Coffea arabica bean containing little caffeine was discovered in Ethiopia in 2004 .
The Lord Howe Island stick insect , Dryococelus australis , is a species of stick insect which lives on the Lord Howe Island Group . It was thought to be extinct by 1930 , only to be rediscovered in 2001 -LRB- this phenomenon is known as the Lazarus effect -RRB- . It is extinct in its largest habitat , Lord Howe Island , and has been called `` the rarest insect in the world '' , as the rediscovered population consisted of fewer than 30 individuals living on the small islet of Ball 's Pyramid .
Fingering is the manual manipulation of the clitoris , vulva , vagina , or anus for the purpose of sexual arousal and stimulation . It may constitute the entire sexual encounter or it may be part of mutual masturbation , foreplay or other sexual activities . To `` finger oneself '' is to masturbate in this manner . It is analogous to a handjob , the manual stimulation of the penis . These activities provide sexual pleasure , whether or not used as non-penetrative or penetrative intercourse .
Vaginal fingering is legally and medically called `` digital penetration of the vagina , '' and may involve one or more fingers .
Massage of the vulva , and in particular the clitoris is the most common way for a woman to reach and achieve an orgasm . The clitoral body or shaft may be massaged , usually through the skin of the clitoral hood , using up-and-down , side-to-side , or circular motions . The labia and the rest of the genitals are also stimulated by massage and fingering .
Fingering the vagina is often performed in an effort to stimulate the G-spot or A-spot . Fingering the external tissues is more likely to lead to orgasm for many women . The G-spot is located roughly 5 cm up on the anterior wall of the vagina , forwards toward the belly button . It can most easily be recognized by its ridges and slightly rougher texture compared to the more cushion-like vaginal cavity walls around it . The A-spot is located deeper in the vagina , on the same wall as the G-spot , where the vaginal wall starts to curve upward -LRB- the entrance to the anterior fornix -RRB- .
Fingering the G-spot is a commonly cited method that can often lead to female ejaculation . This release of fluid can range significantly in quantity and force of expulsion , varying from woman to woman and also varying with different scenarios for each woman . The fluid following a G-spot ejaculation is released from the urethra but is not urine , as its contents do not come in contact with those of the bladder at any stage . This female ejaculate contains antibodies otherwise only found in the male prostate , leading to speculation that it is produced by a structure homologous to the prostate . Parallels are sometimes drawn with the fingering or other manipulation of the male prostate through the anus . Fingering the A-spot is a relatively uncommon method that can often result in rapid lubrication and arousal without any other stimulation . If stimulation is continued , it can also result in orgasm .

Ordo Templi Orientis -LRB- O.T.O. -RRB- -LRB- Order of the Temple of the East , or the Order of Oriental Templars -RRB- is an international fraternal and religious organization founded at the beginning of the 20th century . English author and occultist Aleister Crowley has become the most well known member of the order .
Originally it was intended to be modelled after and associated with Freemasonry , but under the leadership of Aleister Crowley , O.T.O. was reorganized around the Law of Thelema as its central religious principle . This Lawâ '' expressed as â Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law '' and `` Love is the law , love under willâ â '' was promulgated in 1904 with the dictation of The Book of the Law .

The Capetian dynasty is the largest and oldest European royal house , consisting of the descendants of Hugh Capet of France in the male line . In contemporary times , both King Juan Carlos of Spain and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg are members of this family , both through the Bourbon branch of the dynasty .
The name of the dynasty derives from its founder , Hugh , who was known as `` Hugh Capet '' . The meaning of `` Capet '' -LRB- a nickname rather than a surname of the modern sort -RRB- is unknown . While folk etymology identifies it with `` cape '' , other suggestions suggest it to be connected to the Latin word caput -LRB- `` head '' -RRB- , and thus explain it as meaning `` chief '' or `` big head '' .

JÃ rriais is the form of the Norman language spoken in Jersey , in the Channel Islands , off the coast of France . It has been in decline over the past century as English has increasingly become the language of education , commerce and administration . There are very few people who speak JÃ rriais as a mother tongue and , owing to the age of the remaining speakers , their numbers decrease annually . Despite this , efforts are being made to keep the language alive .
A similar language , DgÃ rnÃ siais is spoken in neighbouring Guernsey ; the language of Sark , Sercquiais , is a descendant of the JÃ rriais brought by the Jersey colonists who settled Sark in the 16th century ; and there is inter-comprehension with the Norman language of mainland Normandy .
Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn -LRB- soÊ lÊ ' É Ë niË tsÉ n , -RRB- -LRB- 11 December 1918 â `` 3 August 2008 -RRB- was a Russian and Soviet novelist , dramatist , and historian . Through his often-suppressed writings , he helped to raise global awareness of the Gulag , the Soviet Union 's forced labor camp system â `` particularly in The Gulag Archipelago and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich , two of his best-known works . Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1970 . He was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974 , but returned to Russia in 1994 after the Soviet system had collapsed . Solzhenitsyn was the father of Ignat Solzhenitsyn , a conductor and pianist .

The Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit is a street circuit around Albert Park Lake , only a few kilometres south of central Melbourne . It is used annually as a racetrack for the Australian Grand Prix and associated support races .
The circuit uses everyday sections of road that circle Albert Park Lake , a small man-made lake just south of the Central Business District of Melbourne . The road sections that are used were rebuilt prior to the inaugural event in 1996 to ensure consistency and smoothness . As a result , compared to other circuits that are held on public roads , the Albert Park track has quite a smooth surface . Before 2007 there existed only a few other places on the Formula 1 calendar with a body of water close to the track . Most of the new tracks , such as Valencia , Singapore and Abu Dhabi have imitated that feature .
The course is considered to be quite fast and relatively easy to drive , drivers having commented that the consistent placement of corners allows them to easily learn the circuit and achieve competitive times . However , the flat terrain around the lake , coupled with a track design that features few true straights , means that the track is not conducive to overtaking or easy spectating unless in possession of a grandstand seat .
Each year , most of the trackside fencing , pedestrian overpasses , grandstands and other motorsport infrastructure are erected approximately a month prior to the Grand Prix weekend and removed within 6 weeks after the event . Land around the circuit -LRB- including a large aquatic center , a golf course , a Lakeside Stadium , some restaurants and rowing boathouses -RRB- has restricted access during the grand prix weekend . Dissent is still prevalent among nearby local residents and some still maintain a silent protest against the event . Nevertheless , the event is reasonably popular in Melbourne and Australia -LRB- with a large European population and a general interest in motorsport -RRB- . Middle Park , the home of South Melbourne FC was demolished in 1994 due to expansion at Albert Park .
On 4 July 2008 , the official F1 site reported that more than 300,000 people attended the four-day Melbourne Grand Prix , though actual ticket sales were later disputed by the local media . The Grand Prix will continue until at least 2015 after securing a new contract with Formula One Management . There will be no night races in Albert Park but 2009 â s event started at 5pm and took place between 26 â `` 29 March .

In cryptography , RC5 is a block cipher notable for its simplicity . Designed by Ronald Rivest in 1994 , RC stands for `` Rivest Cipher '' , or alternatively , `` Ron 's Code '' -LRB- compare RC2 and RC4 -RRB- . The Advanced Encryption Standard -LRB- AES -RRB- candidate RC6 was based on RC5 .
Unlike many schemes , RC5 has a variable block size -LRB- 32 , 64 or 128 bits -RRB- , key size -LRB- 0 to 2040 bits -RRB- and number of rounds -LRB- 0 to 255 -RRB- . The original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of 64 bits , a 128-bit key and 12 rounds .
A key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent rotations ; one of the goals of RC5 was to prompt the study and evaluation of such operations as a cryptographic primitive . RC5 also consists of a number of modular additions and eXclusive OR -LRB- XOR -RRB- s. The general structure of the algorithm is a Feistel-like network . The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code . The key schedule , however , is more complex , expanding the key using an essentially one-way function with the binary expansions of both e and the golden ratio as sources of `` nothing up my sleeve numbers '' . The tantalising simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive object of study for cryptanalysts . The RC5 is basically denoted as RC5-w\/r\/b where w = word size in bits , r = number of rounds , b = number of 8-bit byte in the key .
12-round RC5 -LRB- with 64-bit blocks -RRB- is susceptible to a differential attack using 244 chosen plaintexts . 18 -- 20 rounds are suggested as sufficient protection .
RSA Security , which has a patent on the algorithm , offered a series of US$ 10,000 prizes for breaking ciphertexts encrypted with RC5 , but these contests have been discontinued as of May 2007 . A number of these challenge problems have been tackled using distributed computing , organised by Distributed.net . Distributed.net has brute-forced RC5 messages encrypted with 56-bit and 64-bit keys , and is working on cracking a 72-bit key ; as of March 2011 , 1.488 % of the keyspace has been searched . At the current rate , it will take approximately 90 years to test every possible remaining key , and thus guarantee completion of the project .

San Luis PotosÃ is a state of Mexico , situated in the center of the country . It is bordered by Coahuila to the north , Nuevo LeÃ n to the northeast , Tamaulipas to the east , Veracruz to the east , Hidalgo , QuerÃ taro , and Guanajuato to the south , and Zacatecas to the northwest . At the 2005 census the population was 2,410,414 .
In cryptography , RC2 is a block cipher designed by Ron Rivest in 1987 . `` RC '' stands for `` Ron 's Code '' or `` Rivest Cipher '' ; other ciphers designed by Rivest include RC4 , RC5 and RC6 .
The development of RC2 was sponsored by Lotus , who were seeking a custom cipher that , after evaluation by the NSA , could be exported as part of their Lotus Notes software . The NSA suggested a couple of changes , which Rivest incorporated . After further negotiations , the cipher was approved for export in 1989 . Along with RC4 , RC2 with a 40-bit key size was treated favourably under US export regulations for cryptography .
Initially , the details of the algorithm were kept secret -- proprietary to RSA Security -- but on 29th January , 1996 , source code for RC2 was anonymously posted to the Internet on the Usenet forum , sci . crypt . Mentions of CodeView and SoftICE -LRB- popular debuggers -RRB- suggest that it had been reverse engineered . A similar disclosure had occurred earlier with RC4 .
RC2 is a 64-bit block cipher with a variable size key . Its 18 rounds are arranged as a source-heavy Feistel network , with 16 rounds of one type -LRB- MIXING -RRB- punctuated by two rounds of another type -LRB- MASHING -RRB- . A MIXING round consists of four applications of the MIX transformation , as shown in the diagram .
RC2 is vulnerable to a related-key attack using 234 chosen plaintexts -LRB- Kelsey et al . , 1997 -RRB- .
Bundala National Park is an internationally important wintering ground for migratory water birds in Sri Lanka . Bundala harbors 197 species of Birds , the highlight being the Greater Flamingo , which migrate in large flocks . Bundala was designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1969 and redesignated to a national park on 4 January 1993 . In 1991 Bundala became the first wetland to be declared as a Ramsar site in Sri Lanka . In 2005 the national park was designated as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO , the fourth biosphere reserve in Sri Lanka . The national park is situated 245 k southeast of Colombo .
A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle -LRB- PHEV or PHV -RRB- , also known as a plug-in hybrid , is a hybrid vehicle with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source -LRB- usually simply a normal electric wall socket -RRB- . A PHEV shares the characteristics of both a conventional hybrid electric vehicle , having an electric motor and an internal combustion engine ; and of an all-electric vehicle , also having a plug to connect to the electrical grid . Most PHEVs on the road today are passenger cars , but there are also PHEV versions of commercial vehicles and vans , utility trucks , buses , trains , motorcycles , scooters , and military vehicles .
The cost for electricity to power plug-in hybrids for all-electric operation has been estimated at less than one quarter of the cost of gasoline . Compared to conventional vehicles , PHEVs reduce air pollution locally and dependence on petroleum . PHEVs may reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming , compared with conventional vehicles . PHEVs also eliminate the problem of range anxiety associated to all-electric vehicles , because the combustion engine works as a backup when the batteries are depleted , giving PHEVs driving range comparable to other vehicles with gasoline tanks . Plug-in hybrids use no fossil fuel during their all-electric range and produce lower greenhouse gas emissions if their batteries are charged from renewable electricity . Other benefits include improved national energy security , fewer fill-ups at the filling station , the convenience of home recharging , opportunities to provide emergency backup power in the home , and vehicle-to-grid -LRB- V2G -RRB- applications .
Chinese battery manufacturer and automaker BYD Auto released the F3DM PHEV-62 -LRB- PHEV-100 km -RRB- to the Chinese fleet market on December 15 , 2008 and began sales to the general public in Shenzhen in March 2010 . General Motors officially launched the Chevrolet Volt PHEV-35 -LRB- PHEV-100 km -RRB- in the U.S. on November 30 , 2010 . Other plug-in vehicles ongoing demonstration trials or slated to the market for 2011 and 2012 are the Fisker Karma , Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid , Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid , Volvo V70 Plug-in Hybrid , Suzuki Swift Plug-in , and Audi A1 e-tron .
Until 2010 most PHEVs on the road in the US are conversions of conventional hybrid electric vehicles , and the most prominent PHEVs are conversions of 2004 or later Toyota Prius , which have had plug-in charging and more batteries added and their electric-only range extended . Several countries , including the United States and several European countries , have enacted laws to facilitate the introduction of PHEVs through grants and tax credits , emissions mandates , and by financing research and development of advanced batteries and other related technologies .
A plug-in hybrid 's all-electric range is designated by PHEV - -LRB- miles -RRB- or PHEV -LRB- kilometers -RRB- km in which the number represents the distance the vehicle can travel on battery power alone . For example , a PHEV-20 can travel twenty miles -LRB- 32 km -RRB- without using its combustion engine , so it may also be designated as a PHEV32km .
Pedro Romeiras -LRB- born July 3 , 1961 in Lisbon -RRB- started his career as a soloist with the National Ballet of Portugal after finishing ballet studies at the Royal Ballet School . He is a gold medal winner of the II Prix FranÃ ais de la Danse 1982 and won a National Globe Award as best dancer of 1982 . Romeiras has danced many glamorous principal roles of classical repertoire ballets such as Siegfried in the full length version of Swan Lake , Basilio in Don Quixote , Jean de Brienne in Raymonda , Romeo in Romeo and Juliet , The Poet in Les Sylphides , and many others . Romeiras has worked and been a guest at the Dutch National Ballet and Ballet D'el Teatro Municipal as a dancer , ballet master , and choreographer .

The Seine is a major river and commercial waterway within the regions of the Ã le-de-France and Haute-Normandie in France . It is 776 km -LRB- 486 miles -RRB- long , rising at Saint-Seine near Dijon in center-eastern France in the Langres plateau , flowing through Paris and into the English Channel at Le Havre . It is navigable by ocean-going vessels as far as Rouen , 120 km -LRB- 75 miles -RRB- from the sea . Over sixty percent of its length , as far as Burgundy , is negotiable by commercial riverboats and nearly its whole length is available for recreational boating : excursion boats offer sightseeing tours of the Rive Droite and Rive Gauche within the city of Paris .
The yo-yo is a popular toy consisting of a length of string tied at one end to a flat spool . It is played by holding the free end of the string -LRB- usually by inserting one finger in a slip knot -RRB- and pulling at it so as to cause the spool to turn whilst suspended in mid-air , either taking up or releasing the string . First made popular in the 1920s , yo-yoing is still very much enjoyed by both children and adults , though it was originally made as a children 's play toy .
In the simplest play , the string is initially wound on the spool by hand ; the yo-yo is then thrown downwards so that it first descends unwinding the string , then -LRB- by inertia -RRB- climbs back winding it up ; and finally the yo-yo is grabbed , ready to be thrown again . Many other trick plays exist , most based on the basic sleeper trick . One of the most famous tricks on the yoyo is `` walk the dog '' . This is done by throwing a strong sleeper and allowing the yoyo to roll across the floor .
English historical names for the yo-yo include bandalore -LRB- from French -RRB- and quiz . French historical terms include bandalore , incroyable , de Coblenz , emigrette , and joujou de Normandie -LRB- joujou meaning little toy -RRB- .
The earliest surviving yo-yo dates to 500 BC and was made using terra cotta skin disks . A Greek vase painting from this period shows a boy playing yo-yo -LRB- see right -RRB- . Greek records from the period describe toys made out of wood , metal , or painted terra cotta -LRB- fired clay -RRB- . The terra cotta disks were used to ceremonially offer the toys of youth to certain gods when a child came of age -- discs of other materials were used for actual play .
Philippine historical records indicate that 16th-century hunters hiding in trees used a rock tied to a cord up to 20 feet in length to throw at wild animals beneath them -- the cord enabling retrieval of the rock after missed attempts .
Convergent evolution describes the acquisition of the same biological trait in unrelated lineages .
The wing is a classic example of convergent evolution in action . Although their last common ancestor did not have wings , birds and bats do , and are capable of powered flight . The wings are similar in construction , due to the physical constraints imposed upon wing shape . Similarity can also be explained by shared ancestry , as evolution can only work with what is already thereâ '' thus wings were modified from limbs , as evidenced by their bone structure .
Traits arising through convergent evolution are termed analogous structures , in contrast to homologous structures , which have a common origin . Bat and pterosaur wings are an example of analogous structures , while the bat wing is homologous to human and other mammal forearms , sharing an ancestral state despite serving different functions . Similarity in species of different ancestry that is the result of convergent evolution is called homoplasy . The opposite of convergent evolution is divergent evolution , whereby related species evolve different traits . On a molecular level , this can happen due to random mutation unrelated to adaptive changes ; see long branch attraction . Convergent evolution is similar to , but distinguishable from , the phenomena of evolutionary relay and parallel evolution . Evolutionary relay describes how independent species acquire similar characteristics through their evolution in similar ecosystems at different times -- for example the dorsal fins of extinct ichthyosaurs and sharks . Parallel evolution occurs when two independent species evolve together at the same time in the same ecospace and acquire similar characteristicsâ '' for instance extinct browsing-horses and paleotheres .
Similarity can also result if organisms occupy similar ecological nichesâ '' that is , a distinctive way of life . A classic comparison is between the marsupial fauna of Australia and the placental mammals of the Old World . The two lineages are cladesâ '' that is , they each share a common ancestor that belongs to their own group , and are more closely related to one another than to any other cladeâ '' but very similar forms evolved in each isolated population . Many body plans , for instance sabre-toothed cats and flying squirrels , evolved independently in both populations .
Piracy is a war-like act committed by private parties -LRB- not affiliated with any government -RRB- that engage in acts of robbery and\/or criminal violence at sea . People who engage in these acts are called pirates .
The term can include acts committed in other major bodies of water or on a shore . It does not normally include crimes committed against persons traveling on the same vessel as the perpetrator -LRB- e.g. one passenger stealing from others on the same vessel -RRB- . The term has been used to refer to raids across land borders by non-state agents .
Piracy should be distinguished from privateering , which was authorized by their national authorities and therefore a legitimate form of war-like activity by non-state actors . This form of commerce raiding was outlawed in the 19th century .
The English `` pirate '' is derived from the Latin term pirata and that from Greek '' Ï Î Î Ï Î Ï Î Ï '' -LRB- peiratÄ `` s -RRB- , `` brigand '' , in turn from '' Ï Î Î Ï Î Î Î 1\/4 Î Î '' -LRB- peirÃ omai -RRB- , `` attempt '' , from '' Ï Î á -- Ï Î '' -LRB- peÃ ra -RRB- , `` attempt , experience '' . The word is also cognate to peril .
Maritime piracy , according to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea -LRB- UNCLOS -RRB- of 1982 , consists of any criminal acts of violence , detention , rape , or depredation committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or aircraft that is directed on the high seas against another ship , aircraft , or against persons or property on board a ship or aircraft . Piracy can also be committed against a ship , aircraft , persons , or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any state , in fact piracy has been the first example of universal jurisdiction . Nevertheless today the international community is facing many problems in bringing pirates to justice .

White Hart Lane station in Tottenham was originally a station on the Stoke Newington & Edmonton Railway : it opened on 22 July 1872 . It is currently operated by National Express East Anglia and is in Travelcard Zone 3 , on the Seven Sisters branch of the Lea Valley Lines . The station is usually served by 8 trains per hour - four northbound -LRB- towards Cheshunt or Enfield town -RRB- and four southbound -LRB- towards Liverpool street and also sometimes but rarely Stratford via South tottenham station on the London Overground line -RRB- . In the peak time the station gets 12 trains per hour -- this time 6 northbound and 6 southbound .
In the peak times the National express East Anglia services usually are 8 car trains and there are proposals to extend the platforms in order for a ninth car train to be re-introduced but this seems unlikely to happen . The station has a ticket office which is usually open all the time and there is also a few shops around the station which mainly sell food such as cakes and chips . The station has four entrances\/exits but two of these are only used on match day football games for local side Tottenham Hotspurs where the station becomes really busy . The ticket office is not open on Sundays but recently in 2010 on a few Sunday mornings the ticket office has been open but this has only been open for a few hours .
Saint-Marcel-l Ã s-Annonay is a commune in the ArdÃ che department in southern France .
The village was founded in 972 . The DeÃ '' me passes through Saint-Marcel and flows into the Cance with Annonay . Water from these rivers come from the granitic areas and is very pure . Their patent rights have been recognized for several centuries with the rise of paper mills . The paper mills of Annonay by Montgolfier-Canson formed only two groups in the 18th century from Vidalon and Faya .
In 1805 , Jean-Baptiste de Montgolfier was detached from Vidalon to create a factory in Saint-Marcel . Paper production was a large contributor to the rise of the commune and was the main industry for a long period of time . The employees of paper mills were called les usines , French for factory and formed the integral part of their culture and life .

Bolognese sauce -LRB- ragÃ alla bolognese in Italian , also known by its French name sauce bolognaise -RRB- is a meat-based sauce for pasta originating in Bologna , Italy . Bolognese sauce is sometimes taken to be a tomato sauce , but authentic recipes have only a small amount of tomato concentrate .
The traditional recipe , registered in 1982 by the Bolognese delegation of Accademia Italiana della Cucina , confines the ingredients to beef , pancetta , onions , tomato paste , meat broth , white wine , and milk or cream . However , different recipes , even in the Bolognese tradition , make use of chopped pork or pork sausage , white chicken , rabbit , or goose liver may be added along with the beef or veal for special occasions , and today many use both butter and olive oil for cooking the soffritto of small amounts of celery , carrot and onion . Prosciutto , mortadella , or porcini fresh mushrooms when in season may be added to the ragÃ to further enrich the sauce . Milk is frequently used in the early stages of cooking to render the meat flavors more delicate but cream is very rare in the everyday recipe and only a very little would be used . According to Marcella Hazan in `` The Classic Italian Cookbook '' , the longer RagÃ alla Bolognese cooks the better ; a 5 - or 6-hour simmer is not unusual . The people of Bologna traditionally serve their famous ragÃ with freshly made tagliatelle -LRB- tagliatelle alla bolognese -RRB- and their traditionally green lasagne .
On Sunday , 17 January 2010 , 450 chefs in Italian restaurants in 50 countries cooked bolognese to an authentic recipe in order to promote Tagliatelle al ragÃ alla bolognese . International newspapers did not always reference the Accademia Italiana della Cucina recipe and usually published stock photographs of Spaghetti alla Bolognese . In Italy , the pasta is stirred into the sauce to gather flavor rather than sat atop of the dish .
Spaghetti alla Bolognese , Spaghetti Bolognese , Esparguete Ã bolonhesa or Spaghetti Bolognaise in a form popular outside of Italy , consists of a meat sauce served on a bed of spaghetti with a good sprinkling of grated Parmigiano cheese . Although Spaghetti alla Bolognese is very popular outside of Italy it never existed in Bologna , where ragÃ is served always with the local egg pastas tagliatelle or lasagne . Spaghetti is a durum wheat pasta from Naples , and the Naples RagÃ of a meat flavored thick tomato sauce clings much better to slippery spaghetti than Bologna 's ground beef ragÃ .
In recent decades , the dish has become very popular in Australia , Sweden , Finland , Denmark and Norway . Called , in Swedish , , in Finnish , ' in Danish , and ' in Norwegian , especially among children . A version is popular in the United Kingdom . In the United States also the term ` bolognese ' is applied to a tomato-and-ground-beef sauce that bears little resemblance to ragÃ served in Bologna .
The Accademia Italiana della Cucina -LRB- Italian Academy of Cuisine -RRB- , witnessed the authentic recipe for Bolognese RagÃ being registered with the Bologna Chamber of Commerce on 17 October 1982 in the Palazzo della Mercanzia . The recipe below is reproduced from the Classic Bolognese RagÃ according to the Accademia Italiana della Cucina
Everton Football Club are a professional English Football league club from the city of Liverpool . The club competes in the Premier League , the highest level of English football . They have competed in the top division for a record 108 seasons , they have played more top-flight league games than any other English team and have won the League Championship nine timesâ '' the fourth highest of any team . Everton have remained in the top division since 1954 , and were founder members of the Premier League in 1992 .
Formed in 1878 , Everton were founding members of The Football League in 1888 and won their first league championship two seasons later . Following four league titles and two FA Cup wins , Everton experienced a lull in the immediate post World War Two period until a revival in the 1960s , winning two league championships and an FA Cup . The mid-1980s represented their most recent period of success , with two League Championship successes , an FA Cup , and the 1985 European Cup Winners ' Cupâ '' their first continental trophy . The club 's most recent major trophy was the 1995 FA Cup . The club 's supporters are known as Evertonians . Everton have a large fanbase and regularly attract high attendances , averaging over 36,000 people per game : 95 % of stadium capacity . Everton have a notable rivalry with neighbors Liverpool F.C. and the two sides regularly contest the Merseyside Derby . Liverpool F.C. were formed in 1892 by a breakaway group consisting of Everton 's former president and a few players . The dispute also resulted in Everton leaving Anfield , their home ground at the time . The club have been based at their current home ground , Goodison Park , since 1892 . Plans to move to a new 50,000 seater expandable stadium in Kirkby on the Liverpool city border were blocked by a public enquiry in 2009 .
The club 's home colors have traditionally been royal blue and white , with notable footballers donning the Everton shirt . The most famous is Dixie Dean , who scored a record 60 league goals in the 1927 â `` 28 season . Since 2000 , the club has annually recognized notable former players , nominating an `` Everton Giant '' at the beginning of each season .
Everton was founded as St Domingo 's in 1878 so that people from the parish of St Domingo 's Methodist Church in Everton could play a sport in non-summer months â `` cricket was played in summer . A year later , the club was renamed Everton F.C. after the local area , as people outside the parish wished to participate .
The club was a founding member of the Football League in 1888 â `` 1889 , winning their first League Championship title in the 1890 â `` 91 season . Everton won the FA Cup for the first time in 1906 and the League title again in 1914 â `` 15 . The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 meant that football was interrupted while Everton were champions , something that would again occur in 1939 .
It was not until 1927 that Everton 's first sustained period of success began . In 1925 the club signed Dixie Dean who , in 1927 â `` 28 , set the record for league goals in a single season with 60 goals in 39 league games , a record that still stands to this day . Dean helped Everton to achieve their third league title .
Everton were relegated to the Second Division two years later during internal turmoil at the club . However , the club was promoted at the first attempt scoring a record number of goals in the second division . On return to the top flight in 1931 â `` 32 , Everton wasted no time in reaffirming their status and won a fourth League title at the first opportunity . Everton also won their second FA Cup in 1933 with a 3 â `` 0 win against Manchester City in the final . The era ended in 1938 â `` 39 with a fifth League title .
The outbreak of the Second World War saw the suspension of League football , and when official competition resumed in 1946 the Everton team had been split-up and paled in comparison to the pre-war club . Everton were relegated again in 1950 â `` 51 and did not return until 1953 â `` 54 , when finishing as runners-up in their third season in the Second Division . The club have been a top flight presence ever since .
Everton 's second successful era started when Harry Catterick was made manager in 1961 . In 1962 â `` 63 , his second season in charge , Everton won the League title and in 1966 the FA Cup followed with a 3 â `` 2 win over Sheffield Wednesday . Everton again reached the final in 1968 , but this time were unable to overcome West Bromwich Albion at Wembley . Two seasons later in 1969 â `` 70 , Everton won the League championship , nine points clear of nearest rivals Leeds United . During this period , Everton were the first English club to achieve five consecutive years in European competitionsâ '' seasons 1961 â `` 62 to 1966 â `` 67 .
However , the success did not last ; the team finished fourteenth , fifteenth , seventeenth and seventh in the following seasons . Harry Catterick retired but his successors failed to win any silverware for the remainder of the 1970s . Though the club mounted title challenges finishing fourth in 1974 â `` 75 under manager Billy Bingham , and under manager Gordon Lee , third in 1977 â `` 78 and fourth the following season . Manager Gordon Lee was sacked in 1981 .

Domestically , Everton won the FA Cup in 1984 and two league titles in 1984 â `` 85 and 1986 â `` 87 and the club 's first and so far only European trophy when they won the European Cup Winners ' Cup in the 1985 final
The European success came after first beating , Inter Bratislava and Fortuna Sittard , Everton defeated German giants Bayern Munich 3 â `` 1 in the semi-finals , despite trailing at half time -LRB- in a match voted the greatest in Goodison Park history -RRB- and recorded the same scoreline over Austrian club Rapid Vienna in the final .
Having won both the league and Cup Winners Cup in 1985 , Everton came very close to winning a treble , but lost to Manchester United in the FA Cup final . The following season , 1985 â `` 86 , Everton were runners up to neighbors Liverpool in both the league and the FA Cup , but did recapture the league title in 1986 â `` 87 .
After the Heysel Stadium disaster and the subsequent ban of all English clubs from continental football , Everton lost the chance to compete for more European trophies . A large proportion of the title-winning side was broken up following the ban . Kendall himself moved to Athletic Bilbao after the 1987 title triumph and was succeeded by assistant Colin Harvey . Harvey took Everton to the 1989 final , but lost 3 â `` 2 after Extra time to Liverpool .

Acinos is a genus of ten species of annual and short-lived evergreen perennial woody plants native to southern Europe and western Asia . Its name comes from the Greek word akinos , the name of a small aromatic plant . They are small , tufted , bushy or spreading plants growing to 10-45 cm tall . The 2-lipped , tubular flowers are borne on erect sprikes in mid-summer .
`` Sumer Is Icumen In '' is a traditional English round , and possibly the oldest such example of counterpoint in existence . The title might be translated as `` Summer has come in '' or `` Summer has arrived '' .
The round is sometimes known as the Reading rota because the manuscript comes from Reading Abbey though it may not have been written there . It is the oldest piece of six-part polyphonic music -LRB- Albright , 1994 -RRB- . Its composer is anonymous , possibly W. de Wycombe , and it is estimated to date from around 1260 . The manuscript is now at the British Library . The language is Middle English , more exactly Wessex dialect .

Stockport is a large town in Greater Manchester , England . It lies on elevated ground on the River Mersey at the confluence of the rivers Goyt and Tame , 6.1 m southeast of the city of Manchester . Stockport is the largest settlement of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport , and has a population of 136,082 , the wider borough having 281,000 .
Historically a part of Cheshire , Stockport in the 16th century was a small town entirely on the southbank of the Mersey , and known for the cultivation of hemp and rope manufacture and in the 18th century the town had one of the first mechanised silk factories in the United Kingdom . However , Stockport 's predominant industries of the 19th century were the cotton and allied industries . Stockport was also at the center of the country 's hatting industry which by 1884 was exporting more than six million hats a year . In December 1997 the last Stockport hat works closed . The town 's hatting heritage is preserved at ` Hat Works -- the Museum of Hatting ' .
Dominating the western approaches to the town is the Stockport Viaduct . Built in 1840 , the viaduct 's 27 brick arches over the River Mersey carry the mainline railways from Manchester to Birmingham and London . This structure featured as the background in many paintings by L.S. Lowry . Lowry often visited the Stockport War Memorial Gallery on Greek Street especially during the annual Stockport Art Guild exhibition of paintings and sculpture .
Stockport was first recorded as `` Stokeport '' in 1170 . The currently accepted etymology is Old English stoc , a market place , with port , a hamlet -LRB- but more accurately a minor settlement within an estate -RRB- ; hence , a market place at a hamlet . Older derivations include stock , a stockaded place or castle , with port , a wood , hence a castle in a wood . The castle part of the name probably refers to Stockport Castle , a 12th century motte-and-bailey first mentioned in 1173 .

In statistical hypothesis testing , Type I and Type II errors refer to incorrect conclusions that can be drawn during a test . In any test there are four basic options : two which are accurate -- something is true and a test says it is true ; something is false and a test says it is false -- and two options which are errors -- something is false but a test says it is true ; and something is true but a test says it is false . In a hypothetical example of a patient being tested for HIV , statisticians approach it like this : Begin with the null hypothesis , that the patient does not have the disease ; the alternative hypothesis is that HIV is present . If the null hypothesis is rejected when it is in fact true -LRB- the patient tests positive for infection when the patient is well -RRB- , this is a Type I error or â false positive . â If the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is in fact false -LRB- the patient tests negative when the patient is infected -RRB- , this is a Type II error or â false negativeâ .
In particle physics , an elementary particle or fundamental particle is a particle believed not to have substructure ; that is , it is believed not to be made up of smaller particles . If an elementary particle truly has no substructure , then it is one of the basic building blocks of the universe from which all other particles are made . In the Standard Model , the quarks , leptons , and gauge bosons are elementary particles . Historically , the hadrons -LRB- mesons and baryons such as the proton and neutron -RRB- and even whole atoms were once regarded as elementary particles . A central feature in elementary particle theory is the early 20th century idea of `` quanta '' , which revolutionized the understanding of electromagnetic radiation and brought about quantum mechanics . For mathematical purposes , elementary particles are normally treated as point particles , although some particle theories such as string theory posit a physical dimension .
All elementary particles are either bosons or fermions -LRB- depending on their spin -RRB- . The spin-statistics theorem identifies the resulting quantum statistics that differentiates fermions from bosons . According to this methodology : particles normally associated with matter are fermions . They have half-integer spin and are divided into twelve flavors . Particles associated with fundamental forces are bosons and they have integer spin .
The Standard Model of particle physics contains 12 flavors of elementary fermions , plus their corresponding antiparticles , as well as elementary bosons that mediate the forces and the still undiscovered Higgs boson . However , the Standard Model is widely considered to be a provisional theory rather than a truly fundamental one , since it is not known if it is compatible with Einstein 's general relativity . There are likely to be hypothetical elementary particles not described by the Standard Model , such as the graviton , the particle that would carry the gravitational force or the sparticles , supersymmetric partners of the ordinary particles .
The 12 fundamental fermionic flavors are divided into three generations of four particles each . Six of the particles are quarks . The remaining six are leptons , three of which are neutrinos , and the remaining three of which have an electric charge of â ' 1 : the electron and its two cousins , the muon and the tau .
There are also 12 fundamental fermionic antiparticles which correspond to these 12 particles . The antielectron -LRB- positron -RRB- ' is the electron 's antiparticle and has an electric charge of +1 and so on :
Isolated quarks and antiquarks have never been detected , a fact explained by confinement . Every quark carries one of three color charges of the strong interaction ; antiquarks similarly carry anticolor . Color charged particles interact via gluon exchange in the same way that charged particles interact via photon exchange . However , gluons are themselves color charged , resulting in an amplification of the strong force as color charged particles are separated . Unlike the electromagnetic force which diminishes as charged particles separate , color charged particles feel increasing force .
However , color charged particles may combine to form color neutral composite particles called hadrons . A quark may pair up with an antiquark : the quark has a color and the antiquark has the corresponding anticolor . The color and anticolor cancel out , forming a color neutral meson . Alternatively , three quarks can exist together , one quark being `` red '' , another `` blue '' , another `` green '' . These three colored quarks together form a color-neutral baryon . Symmetrically , three antiquarks with the colors `` antired '' , `` antiblue '' and `` antigreen '' can form a color-neutral antibaryon .
Quarks also carry fractional electric charges , but since they are confined within hadrons whose charges are all integral , fractional charges have never been isolated . Note that quarks have electric charges of either +2 \/ 3 or â ' 1\/3 , whereas antiquarks have corresponding electric charges of either â ' 2\/3 or +1 \/ 3 .
Christian apologetics is a field of Christian theology that aims to present a rational basis for the Christian faith , defend the faith against objections , and expose the perceived flaws of other world views . Christian apologetics have taken many forms over the centuries , starting with Paul of Tarsus , including writers such as Origen and Augustine of Hippo , and continuing currently with the modern Christian community , through the efforts of many authors in various Christian traditions such as C.S. Lewis . Apologists have based their defense of Christianity on historical evidence , philosophical arguments , scientific investigation , and other disciplines .
Ariel is the brightest and fourth-largest of the 27 known moons of Uranus . Discovered on 24 October 1851 by William Lassell , it is named for a sky spirit in Alexander Pope 's The Rape of the Lock and Shakespeare 's The Tempest . Like its parent planet , Ariel orbits on its side , granting it an extreme seasonal cycle . As of 2011 , almost all knowledge of Ariel derives from a single flyby of Uranus performed by the spacecraft Voyager 2 in 1986 , which managed to image only 35 % of the moon 's surface . There are no plans at present to return to study the moon in more detail .
After Miranda , Ariel is the second-smallest of Uranus 's five round satellites , and the second-closest to its planet . Among the smaller of the Solar System 's 19 known spherical moons -LRB- it ranks 14th among them in diameter -RRB- , it is believed to be composed of roughly equal parts ice and rocky material . Like all of Uranus 's moons , Ariel probably formed from an accretion disk that surrounded the planet shortly after its formation , and , like other large moons , it is likely differentiated , with an inner core of rock surrounded by a mantle of ice . Ariel has a complex surface comprising extensive cratered terrain cross-cut by a system of scarps , canyons and ridges . The surface shows signs of more recent geological activity than other Uranian moons , most likely due to tidal heating .

Louise Leakey -LRB- born 1972 -RRB- is a Kenyan paleontologist . She does research and field work related to human fossils in Eastern Africa . She first became actively involved in fossil discoveries in 1977 , at the age of six , when she became the youngest person to find hominid fossils . In 1993 , she replaced her father as field expedition leader for Turkana paleontological expeditions , in one of the most arid and hostile environments on earth . Today , together with her mother , Meave Leakey , she leads the Koobi Fora research project , which has been the main program behind some of the most notable hominid fossil discoveries of the past two decades , the most recent being Kenyanthropus platyops .
Louise Leakey received her IB from United World College of the Atlantic , and a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology and Biology from the University of Bristol . Later she received a PhD degree from the University of London .
Louise Leakey was born in Kenya in 1972 , the same year as her grandfather Louis Leakey died . She married Emmanuel de Merode , a Belgian primatologist in 2003 . They have two daughters Seiya , born in 2004 , and Alexia born in 2006 .

Lionel Brockman Richie , Jr. -LRB- born June 20 , 1949 -RRB- , is an American singer-songwriter , musician and record producer . Since 1968 , he has been a member of the musical group Commodores signed to Motown Records . Richie made his solo debut in 1982 with the album Lionel Richie and number-one hit `` Truly '' .
Born in Tuskegee , Alabama , Richie grew up on the campus of Tuskegee Institute . His grandfather 's house was across the street from the home of the president of the college . His family moved to Joliet , Illinois , where he graduated from Joliet Township High School , East Campus . A star tennis player in Joliet , he accepted a tennis scholarship to attend Tuskegee Institute , and graduated with a major in economics . After receiving his undergraduate degree from Tuskegee , Richie briefly attended graduate school at Auburn University . He is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity .
As a student in Tuskegee , Richie formed a succession of R&B groups in the mid-1960s . In 1968 he became a singer and saxophonist with the Commodores . They signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 1968 for one record before moving on to Motown Records initially as a support act to The Jackson 5 . The Commodores then became established as a popular soul group . Their first several albums had a danceable , funky sound , as in such tracks as `` Machine Gun '' and `` Brick House . '' Over time , Richie wrote and sang more romantic , easy-listening ballads such as `` Easy , '' `` Three Times a Lady , '' `` Still , '' and the tragic breakup ballad `` Sail On . ''
By the late 1970s he had begun to accept songwriting commissions from other artists . He composed `` Lady '' for Kenny Rogers , which hit # 1 in 1980 , and produced Rogers 's album Share Your Love the following year . Richie and Rogers maintained a strong friendship in later years . Latin jazz composer and salsa romantica pioneer La Palabra enjoyed international success with his cover of `` Lady , '' which was played at Latin dance clubs . Also in 1981 Richie sang the theme song for the film Endless Love , a duet with Diana Ross . Issued as a single , the song topped the UK and U.S. pop music charts , and became one of Motown 's biggest hits . Its success encouraged Richie to branch out into a full-fledged solo career in 1982 . He was replaced as lead singer for The Commodores by Skyler Jett in 1983 . His debut album , Lionel Richie , produced another chart-topping single , `` Truly , '' which continued the style of his ballads with the Commodores .
Richie 's 1982 self-titled debut contained three hit singles : the U.S. # 1 song `` Truly , '' which launched his career as one of the most successful balladeers of the 1980s , and the Top Five hits `` You Are '' and `` My Love . '' The album hit # 3 on the music charts and sold over 4 million copies . His 1983 follow-up album , Ca n't Slow Down , sold over twice as many copies and won two Grammy Awards , including Album Of The Year , propelling him into the first rank of international superstars . The album contained the # 1 hit `` All Night Long , '' a Caribbean-flavored dance number that was promoted by a colorful music video produced by former Monkee Michael Nesmith .
In music theory , an interval is a combination of two notes , or the distance between their pitches . Two-note combinations are also called dyads . Although chords are often defined as sets of three or more notes , intervals are sometimes considered to be the simplest kind of chord .
The size or width of an interval can be represented using two alternative and equivalently valid methods , each appropriate to a different context : frequency ratios or cents .
The size of an interval between two pitches may be measured by the ratio of their frequencies . Important intervals are those measured by fractions of small numbers , such as 1:1 -LRB- unison or prime -RRB- , 2:1 -LRB- octave -RRB- , 3:2 -LRB- perfect fifth -RRB- , 4:3 -LRB- perfect fourth -RRB- , etc. -LRB- see : Limit in music -RRB- . This system is frequently used to describe intervals in both Western and non-Western music . This method is also often used in just intonation , and in theoretical explanations of equal-tempered intervals used in European tonal music , to explain them through their approximation of just intervals .
The standard system for comparing interval sizes is with cents . This is a logarithmic scale in which the octave is divided into 1200 equal parts . In equal temperament , each semitone is exactly 100 cents .
The table shows the most widely used conventional names for the intervals between the notes of a chromatic scale . A semitone is any interval between two adjacent notes in a chromatic scale , a whole tone is any interval spanning two semitones , and a tritone is any interval spanning three tones , or six semitones . In Latin nomenclature , the term ditonus was originally used to indicate any interval composed of two tones , but in current English the corresponding term ditone is used with a much more specific meaning , to refer only to a major third with frequency ratio 81:64 .
Intervals with different names but spanning the same number of semitones may have the same width , provided that the instrument is tuned so that the 12 notes of the chromatic scale are equally spaced -LRB- a commonly used tuning system called equal temperament -RRB- . However , they are defined by different notes . For instance , the interval from D to F is a major third , while that from D to G is a diminished fourth , although they have identical width in equal temperament -LRB- 4 semitones , or 400 cents -RRB- .
Except for the Latin ones , the names listed here can not be determined by counting semitones alone . The rules to determine them are explained below . Other names , determined with different naming conventions , are listed in a separate section .
In Western music theory , to name an interval we typically need to determine its number -LRB- also called diatonic number -RRB- and quality . For instance , major third -LRB- or M3 -RRB- is an interval name , in which the term major -LRB- M -RRB- describes the quality of the interval , and third -LRB- 3 -RRB- indicates its number .

C-type asteroids are carbonaceous asteroids . They are the most common variety forming around 75 % of known asteroids , and an even higher percentage in the outer part of the belt beyond 2.7 AU , which is dominated by this asteroid type . The proportion of C-types may actually be greater than this , because C-types are much darker than most other asteroid types except D-types and others common only at the extreme outer edge of the Main Belt .
This type of asteroid has very similar spectra to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites -LRB- types CI and CM -RRB- , whose chemical composition is approximately the same as the Sun and the primitive solar nebula , except that they do not contain hydrogen , helium and other volatiles . Hydrated -LRB- water-containing -RRB- minerals are present .
C-type asteroids are extremely dark with albedos typically in the 0.03 to 0.10 range . Consequently , whereas a number of S-types can normally be viewed with binoculars at opposition , even the largest C-types require a small telescope . The potentially brightest C-type asteroid is 324 Bamberga , but that object 's very high eccentricity means it rarely reaches its maximum magnitude .
Their spectra contain moderately strong ultraviolet absorption at wavelengths below about 0.4 Î 1\/4 m to 0.5 Î 1\/4 m , while at longer wavelengths they are largely featureless but slightly reddish . The so-called `` water '' absorption feature around 3 Î 1\/4 m , which can be an indication of water content in minerals is also present .
The largest unequivocally C-type asteroid is 10 Hygiea , although the SMASS classification places the largest asteroid 1 Ceres , here as well , because that scheme lacks a G-type .
Freemasonry is a fraternal organization that arose from obscure origins in the late 16th to early 17th century . Freemasonry now exists in various forms all over the world , with a membership estimated at around six million , including approximately 150,000 in Scotland and Ireland , over a quarter of a million under the jurisdiction of the United Grand Lodge of England and just under two million in the United States .
The fraternity is administratively organised into independent Grand Lodges or sometimes Orients , each of which governs its own jurisdiction , which consists of subordinate -LRB- or constituent -RRB- Lodges . The various Grand Lodges recognize each other , or not , based upon adherence to landmarks -LRB- a Grand Lodge will usually deem other Grand Lodges who share common landmarks to be regular , and those that do not to be `` irregular '' or `` clandestine '' -RRB- .
There are also appendant bodies , which are organizations related to the main branch of Freemasonry , but with their own independent administration .
Freemasonry uses the metaphors of operative stonemasons ' tools and implements , against the allegorical backdrop of the building of King Solomon 's Temple , to convey what has been described by both Masons and critics as `` a system of morality veiled in allegory and illustrated by symbols . ''
Sapindales is a botanical name for an order of flowering plants . Well-known members of Sapindales include citrus ; maples , horse-chestnuts , lychees and rambutans ; mangos and cashews ; frankincense and myrrh ; mahogany and neem .
102 Dalmatians : Puppies to the Rescue is a videogame based on the live-action Disney movie 102 Dalmatians . It made its debut in 2000 on the Sega Dreamcast and Sony PlayStation .
The game itself follows the films ' storyline loosely . The player can choose the role of one of two dalmatians , Oddball or Domino , who are out in the backyard looking for treasure . It is not long before the player realizes that a toy found buried in a park was made at one of Cruella de Vil 's toy factories ; this alludes to the fact that Cruella 's toy sales are down , which ultimately leads to the problem in the storyline . Facing financial ruin from lack of sales , Cruella sets an evil plan in motion - to reprogram her toys to capture any pets in sight . Oddball and Domino are the only puppies in their family who have not been captured when they return from the park . Their parents , Dottie and Dipstick , set out to rescue their puppies , commanding Oddball and Domino to stay home and ` be good . ' The puppies do not listen , and are soon out on their biggest adventure yet - to save their brothers and sisters , and their parents who are captured along the way .
Throughout the game , the puppies have to rescue their siblings , fend off Cruella 's henchmen , and Cruella herself several times , while navigating through all kinds of terrain , leading up to a final battle at Cruella 's toy factory , during which Cruella -LRB- and her `` Dot Com Darling , '' Dr. Farzboom -RRB- are encased in Farzboom 's own creation , `` supergloop . '' Ironic , considering Cruella 's plan was to encase all the puppies in this heavy-duty glue-like substance to create a line of realistic animal toys . The henchmen end up deserted on an island , and Cruella ends up in a jail cell , still glued to Farzboom .
Over the course of the game , the player has several opportunities to collect ` stickers ' towards a virtual sticker book which can be accessed through the level menu . Various actions within the game will unlock stickers . Generally , there is a sticker for finding the first checkpoint and exiting every level , collecting 100 bones each level , and rescuing all the puppies in each level . Each level has its own individual tasksâ '' completing a chore , defeating a henchmen , solving a puzzle , etc. -- which will also grant stickers . There are six stickers per a level , excluding Cruella levels , which combine together with mini games for their own sticker image .
Puppies to the Rescue is a 3-dimensional game with the ability to angle the camera in whichever direction will make it easiest to navigate for you . The player must bark at toys to short-circuit them , or roll into them to smash them .
Checkpoints within a level are places where the player will be sent back if you lose a life , and are marked by a parrot named Waddlesworth . If the player loses a life and have not reached a checkpoint , you will be sent back to the levels starting point . Unlike the Game Boy Color version of the game , toys the players break stay broken .

Kawaramachi Station is the name of four train stations in Japan . `` Girlfriend '' is a song by Canadian recording artist Avril Lavigne . The song was written by Lavigne with her producer Dr. Luke for Lavigne 's third studio album , The Best Damn Thing -LRB- 2007 -RRB- . `` Girlfriend '' was released as the lead single from The Best Damn Thing on 27 February 2007 . In the song , Lavigne adopts a rap-driven style in delivering her lines . Lyrically , the song revolves around its protagonist having a crush on someone who is in a relationship , proclaiming she should be his girlfriend . The song has been noted to have similarities to Toni Basil 's 1982 single `` Mickey '' , and The Rubinoos ' 1979 single `` I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend '' .
Songwriters of the previous song later sued Lavigne and Dr. Luke for copyright infringement , before the suit was settled . `` Girlfriend '' received generally positive reviews from music critics , who complimented its catchiness . The song was a worldwide success , peaking at the top spot of the charts in the eight countries , including Canada , the United States , and Australia . It additionally charted in the top ten of most other countries . The song 's accompanying music video , directed by The Malloys sees Lavigne portraying three alter-egos , with all of them fighting over the same guy . In June 2007 , the song 's official remix , featuring American rapper Lil Mama was released .
Lavigne performed the song a number of times , including at the 2007 MuchMusic Video Awards , the 2007 Teen Choice Awards , and the 2008 Juno Awards . The song 's success made it a mainstay of pop music in the late 2000s . `` Girlfriend '' was certified multi-platinum in Australia and the United States . It was the top-selling song of 2007 , with over 7.3 million worldwide sales . In 2008 , the song became the most viewed video on YouTube , and was the first video on the site to reach 100 million views . Rolling Stone ranked the song number thirty-seven on their list of `` Top 100 Songs of 2007 '' list . Several versions of the song were released with the chorus sung in multiple languages .
The Great Barrier Reef is the world 's largest reef system composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for over 2,600 kilometres -LRB- 1,600 mi -RRB- over an area of approximately 344400 k. The reef is located in the Coral Sea , off the coast of Queensland in north-east Australia .
The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world 's biggest single structure made by living organisms . This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms , known as coral polyps . This reef supports a wide diversity of life , and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981 . CNN labeled it one of the seven natural wonders of the world . The Queensland National Trust named it a state icon of Queensland .
A large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park , which helps to limit the impact of human use , such as fishing and tourism . Other environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff , climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching , and cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish .
The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples , and is an important part of local groups ' cultures and spirituality . The reef is a very popular destination for tourists , especially in the Whitsunday Islands and Cairns regions . Tourism is an important economic activity for the region , generating A$ 1 billion per year .
The Great Barrier Reef is a distinct feature of the East Australian Cordillera division . It includes the smaller Murray Islands . It reaches from Torres Strait -LRB- between Bramble Cay , its northernmost island , and the south coast of Papua New Guinea -RRB- in the north to the unnamed passage between Lady Elliot Island -LRB- its southernmost island -RRB- and Fraser Island in the south . Lady Elliot Island is located 1915 k southeast of Bramble Cay as the crow flies .
Australia has moved northwards at a rate of 7 c per year , starting during the Cainozoic . Eastern Australia experienced a period of tectonic uplift , which moved the drainage divide in Queensland 400 k inland . Also during this time , Queensland experienced volcanic eruptions leading to central and shield volcanoes and basalt flows . Some of these granitic outcrops have become high islands . After the Coral Sea Basin formed , coral reefs began to grow in the Basin , but until about 25 million years ago , northern Queensland was still in temperate waters south of the tropicsâ '' too cool to support coral growth . The Great Barrier Reef 's development history is complex ; after Queensland drifted into tropical waters , it was largely influenced by reef growth and decline as sea level changed . They can increase in diameter by 1 t per year , and grow vertically anywhere from 1 t per year ; however , they grow only above a depth of 150 m due to their need for sunlight , and can not grow above sea level . When Queensland edged into tropical waters 24 million years ago , some coral grew , but a sedimentation regime quickly developed with erosion of the Great Dividing Range ; creating river deltas , oozes and turbidites , unsuitable conditions for coral growth . 10 million years ago , the sea level significantly lowered , which further enabled sedimentation . The reef 's substrate may have needed to build up from the sediment until its edge was too far away for suspended sediments to inhibit coral growth . In addition , approximately 400,000 years ago there was a particularly warm interglacial period with higher sea levels and a 4 C water temperature change .
The land that formed the substrate of the current Great Barrier Reef was a coastal plain formed from the eroded sediments of the Great Dividing Range with some larger hills -LRB- some of which were themselves remnants of older reefs or volcanoes -RRB- . The Reef Research Centre , a Cooperative Research Centre , has found coral ` skeleton ' deposits that date back half a million years . The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority -LRB- GBRMPA -RRB- considers the earliest evidence of complete reef structures to have been 600,000 years ago . According to the GBRMPA , the current , living reef structure is believed to have begun growing on the older platform about 20,000 years ago . The Australian Institute of Marine Science agrees , placing the beginning of the growth of the current reef at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum . At around that time , sea level was 120 m lower than it is today .
From 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years ago , sea level rose steadily . As it rose , the corals could then grow higher on the hills of the coastal plain . By around 13,000 years ago the sea level was only 60 m lower than the present day , and corals began to grow around the hills of the coastal plain , which were , by then , continental islands . As the sea level rose further still , most of the continental islands were submerged . The corals could then overgrow the hills , to form the present cays and reefs . Sea level here has not risen significantly in the last 6,000 years . The CRC Reef Research Centre estimates the age of the present , living reef structure at 6-8 ,000 years old .
The remains of an ancient barrier reef similar to the Great Barrier Reef can be found in The Kimberley , a northern region of Western Australia .
The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area has been divided into 70 bioregions , of which 30 are reef bioregions . In the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef , ribbon reefs and deltaic reefs have formed ; these structures are not found in the rest of the reef system . There are no atolls in the system , and reefs attached to the mainland are rare .
Fringing reefs are distributed widely , but are most common towards the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef , attached to high islands , for example , the Whitsunday Islands . Lagoonal reefs are found in the southern Great Barrier Reef , and further north , off the coast of Princess Charlotte Bay . Cresentic reefs are the most common shape of reef in the middle of the system , for example the reefs surrounding Lizard Island . Cresentic reefs are also found in the far north of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park , and in the Swain Reefs -LRB- 20-22 degrees south -RRB- . Planar reefs are found in the northern and southern parts , near Cape York Peninsula , Princess Charlotte Bay , and Cairns . Most of the islands on the reef are found on planar reefs .
The Great Barrier Reef supports a diversity of life , including many vulnerable or endangered species , some of which may be endemic to the reef system .
Thirty species of whales , dolphins , and porpoises have been recorded in the Great Barrier Reef , including the dwarf minke whale , Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin , and the humpback whale . Large populations of dugongs live there .
Six species of sea turtles come to the reef to breed â `` the green sea turtle , leatherback sea turtle , hawksbill turtle , loggerhead sea turtle , flatback turtle , and the olive ridley . The green sea turtles on the Great Barrier Reef have two genetically distinct populations , one in the northern part of the reef and the other in the southern part . Fifteen species of seagrass in beds attract the dugongs and turtles , and provide fish habitat . The most common genera of seagrasses are Halophila and Halodule .
Saltwater crocodiles live in mangrove and salt marshes on the coast near the reef . Nesting has not been reported , and the salt water crocodile population in the GBRWHA is wide-ranging but low density . Around 125 species of shark , stingray , skates or chimaera live on the reef . Close to 5,000 species of mollusc have been recorded on the reef , including the giant clam and various nudibranchs and cone snails . Forty-nine species of pipefish and nine species of seahorse have been recorded . At least seven species of frog inhabit the islands .
215 species of birds -LRB- including 22 species of seabirds and 32 species of shorebirds -RRB- visit the reef or nest or roost on the islands , including the white-bellied sea eagle and roseate tern . Most nesting sites are on islands in the northern and southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef , with 1.4 â `` 1.7 million birds using the sites to breed . The islands of the Great Barrier Reef also support 2,195 known plant species ; three of these are endemic . The northern islands have 300 â `` 350 plant species which tend to be woody , whereas the southern islands have 200 which tend to be herbaceous ; the Whitsunday region is the most diverse , supporting 1,141 species . The plants are propagated by birds .
Seventeen species of sea snake live on the Great Barrier Reef in warm waters up to deep and are more common in the southern than in the northern section . None found in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area are endemic , nor are any endangered .
More than 1,500 fish species live on the reef , including the clownfish , red bass , red-throat emperor , and several species of snapper and coral trout . Forty-nine species mass spawn , while eighty-four other species spawn elsewhere in their range .
There are at least 330 species of ascidians on the reef system with the diameter of 1 - . Between 300 â `` 500 species of bryozoans live on the reef .
The Axel is a figure skating jump with a forward take-off . It is named after the Norwegian skater Axel Paulsen , who first performed the jump in 1882 . An Axel jump has an extra Â 1\/2 rotation in the air due to its forward take-off . For a jump with counterclockwise rotation , it has a takeoff from the left forward outside edge and a landing on the right back outside edge ; this can be reversed for a clockwise jump . The Axel can also be done as a double jump with 2 Â 1\/2 rotations , or as a triple with 3 Â 1\/2 rotations . No skater has yet accomplished a quadruple Axel in competition .
To perform an Axel , the skater typically approaches the jump on a right back outside edge in a strongly held check position before stepping onto a left forward outside edge . He or she vaults over the toe pick of the left skate and `` steps up '' into the jump with the right leg . Then the skater brings the left leg through to cross in front of the right in what is known as a back spin position -LRB- similar to that for the loop jump -RRB- , to bring the center of rotation around the right side of the body ; this is often described as a weight shift in the air . Uncrossing the legs on the landing checks the rotation and allows the skater to flow out of the jump with good speed .
It is quite common for skaters to skid the forward takeoff edge slightly , especially on double and triple Axels , rather than vaulting directly off a clean edge . The skid helps the blade grip the ice on the takeoff , and is considered acceptable technique as long as the skid is not so great that the skater pre-rotates the jump or takes off the back of the blade rather than off the toe pick . When the skater makes a mistake in the timing of the jump such that the blade does not grip at all and he or she slips completely off the edge , the result is what is called a waxel , often resulting in a fall .
Computerized biomechanical studies of skaters performing double and triple Axels have shown that skaters typically do not achieve quite as much height on the triple Axel as they do on the double . This may seem counterintuitive , since a higher jump ought to give a skater more time to complete the rotation in the air . Instead , on the triple Axel , skaters do not take such a big `` step up '' so that they can pull in to the rotation position more quickly .
The jump with half a rotation from forward outside to backward outside is called a waltz jump or a three jump in some countries . Any other rotational jump with a forward takeoff is generally considered to be a variation of the Axel . These include :
In addition , an Axel entrance can be used as a take-off for flying spins . An Axel sit spin is also known as a flying reverse sit spin , and is essentially an Axel jump landed in a back sit spin . Rarely , skaters may also attempt a double Axel sit spin . In a flying open Axel sit spin , also known as a death drop , the skater achieves an almost horizontal position in the air -LRB- by kicking the takeoff leg backwards and to the side , instead of bringing it forward -RRB- before landing in a back sit spin .

The United States Department of Homeland Security -LRB- DHS -RRB- is a cabinet department of the United States federal government , created in response to the September 11 attacks , and with the primary responsibilities of protecting the territory of the U.S. from terrorist attacks and responding to natural disasters . In financial year 2010 it was allocated a budget of $ 42.7 billion and spent , net , $ 56.4 billion .
Whereas the Department of Defense is charged with military actions abroad , the Department of Homeland Security works in the civilian sphere to protect the United States within , at , and outside its borders . Its stated goal is to prepare for , prevent , and respond to domestic emergencies , particularly terrorism . On March 1 , 2003 , DHS absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service and assumed its duties . In doing so , it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies : Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services . Additionally , the border enforcement functions of the INS , the U.S. Customs Service , and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS : U.S. Customs and Border Protection . The Federal Protective Service falls under the National Protection and Programs Directorate .

A conglomerate is a rock consisting of individual clasts within a finer-grained matrix that have become cemented together . Conglomerates are sedimentary rocks consisting of rounded fragments and are thus differentiated from breccias , which consist of angular clasts . Both conglomerates and breccias are characterized by clasts larger than sand -LRB- -RRB- 2 mm -RRB- .
In addition to the factors described in this section , conglomerates are classified in terms of both their rounding and sorting .
Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander SchrÃ dinger -LRB- ; 12 August 1887 â `` 4 January 1961 -RRB- was a physicist and theoretical biologist who was one of the fathers of quantum mechanics , and is famed for a number of important contributions to physics , especially the SchrÃ dinger equation , for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 . In 1935 , after extensive correspondence with personal friend Albert Einstein , he proposed the SchrÃ dinger 's cat thought experiment .
In 1887 SchrÃ dinger was born in Vienna , Austria to Rudolf SchrÃ dinger -LRB- cerecloth producer , botanist -RRB- and Georgine Emilia Brenda -LRB- daughter of Alexander Bauer , Professor of Chemistry , k.u.k. Technische Hochschule Vienna -RRB- .
His mother was half Austrian and half English ; the English side of her family came from Leamington Spa . SchrÃ dinger learned English and German almost at the same time because both were spoken in the family household . His father was a Catholic and his mother was a Lutheran .
In 1898 he attended the Akademisches Gymnasium . Between 1906 and 1910 SchrÃ dinger studied in Vienna under Franz Serafin Exner -LRB- 1849 â `` 1926 -RRB- and Friedrich HasenÃ hrl -LRB- 1874 â `` 1915 -RRB- . He also conducted experimental work with Karl Wilhelm Friedrich -LRB- `` Fritz '' -RRB- Kohlrausch -LRB- 1884 â `` 1953 -RRB- . In 1911 SchrÃ dinger became an assistant to Exner . At an early age , SchrÃ dinger was strongly influenced by Schopenhauer . As a result of his extensive reading of Schopenhauer 's works , he became deeply interested throughout his life in color theory , philosophy , perception , and eastern religion , especially Hindu Vedanta .
In 1914 Erwin SchrÃ dinger achieved Habilitation -LRB- venia legendi -RRB- . Between 1914 and 1918 he participated in war work as a commissioned officer in the Austrian fortress artillery -LRB- Gorizia , Duino , Sistiana , Prosecco , Vienna -RRB- . On 6 April 1920 , SchrÃ dinger married Annemarie Bertel . The same year , he became the assistant to Max Wien , in Jena , and in September 1920 he attained the position of ao . Prof. -LRB- Ausserordentlicher Professor -RRB- , roughly equivalent to Reader -LRB- UK -RRB- or associate professor -LRB- US -RRB- , in Stuttgart . In 1921 , he became o. Prof. -LRB- Ordentlicher Professor , i.e. full professor -RRB- , in Breslau -LRB- now WrocÅ aw , Poland -RRB- .
In 1921 , he moved to the University of ZÃ 1\/4 rich . In January 1926 , SchrÃ dinger published in Annalen der Physik the paper `` Quantisierung als Eigenwertproblem '' -LRB- tr . Quantization as an Eigenvalue Problem -RRB- on wave mechanics and what is now known as the SchrÃ dinger equation . In this paper he gave a `` derivation '' of the wave equation for time independent systems , and showed that it gave the correct energy eigenvalues for the hydrogen-like atom . This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century , and created a revolution in quantum mechanics , and indeed of all physics and chemistry . A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that solved the quantum harmonic oscillator , the rigid rotor and the diatomic molecule , and gives a new derivation of the SchrÃ dinger equation . A third paper in May showed the equivalence of his approach to that of Heisenberg and gave the treatment of the Stark effect . A fourth paper in this most remarkable series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time , as in scattering problems . These papers were the central achievement of his career and were at once recognized as having great significance by the physics community .
Francis Scott Key -LRB- August 1 , 1779 â `` January 11 , 1843 -RRB- was an American lawyer , author , and amateur poet , from Georgetown , who wrote the lyrics to the United States ' national anthem , `` The Star-Spangled Banner '' .
Francis Scott Key was born to Ann Phoebe Penn Dagworthy -LRB- Charlton -RRB- and Captain John Ross Key at the family plantation Terra Rubra in what was Frederick County and is now Carroll County , Maryland . His father John Ross Key was a lawyer , a judge and an officer in the Continental Army . His great-grandparents were Philip Key and Susanna Barton Gardiner , both born in London , England , immigrated to Maryland in 1726 .
In team sports , a captain is a title given to a member of the team . The title is frequently honorary , but in some cases the captain may have significant responsibility for strategy and teamwork while the game is in progress on the field . In either case , it is a position that indicates honor and respect from one 's teammates â `` recognition as a leader by one 's peers .
The longest serving captain of any major professional sport is the Detroit Red Wings ' Steve Yzerman , who led the Red Wings for two decades from 1986 to 2006 in the National Hockey League .
Depending on the sport , team captains may be given the responsibility of interacting with game officials regarding application and interpretation of the rules .

6 . ^ http://www.travelsafer.org/index.shtml Fuel oil is a fraction obtained from petroleum distillation , either as a distillate or a residue . Broadly speaking , fuel oil is any liquid petroleum product that is burned in a furnace or boiler for the generation of heat or used in an engine for the generation of power , except oils having a flash point of approximately and oils burned in cotton or wool-wick burners . In this sense , diesel is a type of fuel oil .
Fuel oil is made of long hydrocarbon chains , particularly alkanes , cycloalkanes and aromatics . The term fuel oil is also used in a stricter sense to refer only to the heaviest commercial fuel that can be obtained from crude oil , heavier than gasoline and naphtha . The American Society for Testing and Materials -LRB- ASTM -RRB- has published specifications for six grades of fuel oil , numbered 1 through 6 . This classification system was originally based on early refining and combustion engineering practices and nomenclature .
Some specifications have changed over the years to reflect new refining practices and refinery byproducts . Other organizations have published modified versions of the original six fuel specifications to assist operators of older equipment find appropriate fuels from current refinery products . Although the following trends generally hold true , different organizations may have different numerical specifications for the six fuel grades . The boiling point and carbon chain length of the fuel increases with fuel oil number .

A white Christmas refers to the presence of snow on Christmas Day . This phenomenon is most common in the northern countries of the Northern Hemisphere . Because December is in the middle of the Southern Hemisphere summer , white Christmases there are extremely rare , except in Antarctica , in the Southern Alps of New Zealand 's South Island , and in parts of the Andes in South America .
The definition of `` white Christmas '' varies . In most countries , it simply means that the ground is covered by snow at Christmas , but some countries have more strict definitions . In the United States , the official definition of a white Christmas is that there has to be a snow depth of at least 1 i on Christmas morning , and in Canada the official definition is that there has to be more than 2 c on the ground on Christmas Day . In the United Kingdom , although for many a white Christmas simply means a complete covering of snow on Christmas Day , the official definition by the British Met Office and British bookmakers is for snow to be observed falling , however little , -LRB- even if it melts before it reaches the ground -RRB- in the 24 hours of 25 December . Consequently , according to the Met Office and British bookmakers , even 3 f of snow on the ground at Christmas , because of a heavy snow fall a few days before , will not constitute a white Christmas , but a few snow flakes mixed with rain will , even if they never reach the ground . In the United Kingdom the most likely place to see snowfall on a Christmas day is in North and North Eastern Scotland , in Aberdeen , Aberdeenshire or the Highlands .
In most parts of Canada it is likely to have a white Christmas in most years , except for the coast and southern interior valleys of British Columbia , southern Alberta , southern Ontario , and parts of Atlantic Canada - in those places Christmas without snow is not uncommon in warmer years , with the British Columbia coast the least likely place to have a white Christmas .
2006 saw some of the warmest weather on record , with such places as Quebec City experiencing their first green Christmas in recorded history .
James Dennis Alan `` Denny '' Hamlin -LRB- born November 18 , 1980 -RRB- is an American race car driver . He currently drives the # 11 FedEx Toyota Camry for Joe Gibbs Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series .
Hamlin began his racing career in 1988 , at the age of 7 years old , racing go-karts . By 1997 at 15 he won the WKA manufacturers cup at the age of 16 , he was racing Ministocks . In his first stock car race , at Langley Speedway , Hamlin won the pole position , and won the race . He then progressed to the Grand Stock division in 1998 , and moved on to Late Model Stock Cars in 2000 . In 2002 , he won ten Late Model races , and surpassed that in 2003 with 25 wins , and 30 poles , out of 36 races . In 2004 , while competing full time in Late Model Stock Cars , Hamlin was signed to a driver development contract with Joe Gibbs Racing .
In 2004 , Hamlin competed in five NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series -LRB- NCTS -RRB- races with EJP Racing , and had a tenth-place finish in his NASCAR debut at Indianapolis Raceway Park . He later ran his first career ARCA RE\/MAX Series race at Talladega Superspeedway , finishing third in the # 10 Pontiac owned by Andy Hillenburg . His final start of the year came at Darlington Raceway , when he made his Busch Series debut . He started twenty-seventh -LRB- rain-out -RRB- but finished eighth in the # 18 Joe Gibbs Driven Performance Oil Chevrolet .
Hamlin ran the full season in 2005 after he replaced Mike Bliss in the # 20 Rockwell Automation Chevrolet in the Busch Series . He ended up finishing 5th in the final championship points standings as a rookie in that series , with 11 top 10 's and earnings of $ 1,064,110.00 . Hamlin also ran his first Nextel Cup Series races in 2005 , making his Cup debut at Kansas Speedway as driver of the # 11 FedEx Chevrolet for the 2006 season , after Jason Leffler was released , and made seven starts in in the Cup series in 2005 . He finished the Cup season with three top 10 finishes in those seven starts and one pole at Phoenix International Raceway .
In 2006 , Hamlin ran his first full season in the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series , and during the year he drove in both the Nextel Cup and Busch Series full-time . In Hamlin 's first restrictor plate race as a Nextel Cup driver , he beat all the previous year 's -LRB- 2005 season -RRB- pole winners in the 70-lap 2006 Budweiser Shootout . Hamlin became the first Rookie of the Year candidate to take home the Shootout victory . Hamlin achieved his first career Busch Series victory at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez -LRB- March 5 -RRB- . On June 11 , Hamlin scored his first career Cup Series win at the Pocono 500 , where he also won his second career pole . He achieved his second career win on July 23 , in the Pennsylvania 500 also at Pocono Raceway becoming only the 2nd rookie in Nextel Cup history to sweep both races at a track during the same season -LRB- Jimmie Johnson did so at Dover International Speedway in his rookie season in 2002 -RRB- , both from the pole position . In the Cup Series , Hamlin won the Raybestos Rookie of the Year award and finished third in the final Cup standings , scoring the highest points finish for a rookie in the modern era of NASCAR . Hamlin thus became the first ever rookie to make the Chase for the NEXTEL Cup .
Hamlin started the 2007 Cup season by finishing 28th in the Daytona 500 . He won his third career cup race at the Lenox Industrial Tools 300 at New Hampshire International Speedway . Hamlin clinched a spot in the Chase for the Cup and was seeded sixth , 50 points behind the leader , but finished 12th overall in the final standings . In the Nationwide Series , Hamlin scored three victories including Darlington , Michigan , and Dover in the # 20 Rockwell Automation Chevy .
In 2008 , Hamlin had a near identical season as before , but moved up to eighth in points , and won early in the season at Martinsville Speedway . He led 381 out of 410 laps in the 2008 Crown Royal Presents the Dan Lowry 400 , the most dominant effort of a driver since 2000 . but cut a tire and finished 24th . He won three races in the Nationwide Series , driving both the # 18 and # 20 entries for Gibbs , as well as the # 32 Dollar General\/Haas Avocados car for Braun Racing .
He continued driving the # 11 car in Sprint Cup in 2009 , as well as sharing the # 20 car for Joe Gibbs Racing in the Nationwide Series . Hamlin won his fifth career race at Pocono Raceway on August 3 , 2009 . Hamlin boldly stated at the final restart `` I 'm going to win this race . '' He followed through on the statement , moving from sixth to first and snapping a 50 race win-less streak . The win was Hamlin 's third at Pocono . It was especially emotional for the # 11 team as Hamlin had lost his grandmother , Thelma Clark , that Friday .
Hamlin once again dominated the race at Richmond International Raceway and finally won at his home track . On October 25 , 2009 Hamlin held off Jimmie Johnson to win the TUMS Fast Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway . Hamlin guaranteed that he would win this race after he came in second in the spring race .
Hamlin then went on to win the Ford 400 at the 2009 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway , capping off his 2009 season 5th in the overall standings with 4 wins , 15 top 5 's and 20 top 10 's . Hamlin took the lead after starting the race in 38th position and he led a total of 70 laps to capture his 4th win of the 2009 season . After the 2009 season ended .
Hamlin entered the 2010 season with great expectations . Many believed he would be a favorite to unseat Jimmie Johnson as Sprint Cup Champion .
On January 22 , 2010 , Hamlin tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee while playing basketball . The decision was made to postpone his surgery until after the season .

The Limmat is a river in Switzerland . It is the continuation of the Linth river , known as Limmat from the point of effluence from Lake Zurich , in the city of Zurich . From Zurich it flows in a northwesterly direction , after 35 km reaching the river Aare . The confluence is located north of the small town of Brugg , Aargau and shortly after the mouth of the Reuss .
The main towns along the Limmat Valley downstream of Zurich are Dietikon , Wettingen , and Baden . Its main tributaries are the Sihl -LRB- in Zurich -RRB- and the Reppisch -LRB- in Dietikon -RRB- .
Like many Swiss rivers , it is intensively used for production of hydroelectric power : along its course of , its fall is used by no less than ten hydroelectric power stations .
The name Limmat originates as a combination of the names of the Linth and Maag rivers , the main tributaries of the lake of Zurich before the construction of the Linth canal .
2 Maccabees is a deuterocanonical book of the Bible , which focuses on the Jews ' revolt against Antiochus IV Epiphanes and concludes with the defeat of the Syrian general Nicanor in 161 BC by Judas Maccabeus , the hero of the work .
Unlike 1 Maccabees , 2 Maccabees was written in Koine Greek , probably in Alexandria , Egypt , c 124 BC . It presents a revised version of the historical events recounted in the first seven chapters of 1 Maccabees , adding material from the Pharisaic tradition , including prayer for the dead and a resurrection on Judgment Day .
Sirenia is a gothic metal band from Stavanger , Norway which incorporates a mixture of gothic metal and symphonic metal , as well as extreme metal and death metal elements . The lyrics , written by Morten Veland , tell a loose conceptual story that began at Widow 's Weeds , while he was still a member of Tristania .
The band uses melodic instrumentals , synthesizers , and distorted guitars with female vocals , male death vocals , clean male vocals , a choir and violins . The lyrics are concerned with human existence , emotion , and mental states .
Sirenia came together in early 2001 , when Morten parted ways with his former band Tristania due to musical disagreements and personal differences . The band failed to find a suitable singer prior to recording in France , so they conducted auditions and found Fabienne Gondamin for the recording of their debut album At Sixes and Sevens .

The Improverts is the long-running improvisational comedy troupe of the Edinburgh University Theatre Company which primarily performs out of the Bedlam Theatre , Edinburgh .
They perform every Friday night at 10.30 pm during Edinburgh University 's term time and every night during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe at half past midnight . The Edinburgh University Theatre Company 's improvised comedy troupe now known as The Improverts was founded in Edinburgh in 1989 by Canadian-born Toph Marshall . He named it Theatresports after the form of competitive improvisation developed by director Keith Johnstone in Calgary , Canada in 1976 . As the show grew in popularity the name was changed , during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe , -LRB- for copyright reasons -RRB- to Impro-Vegetables and then finally , in the 90s , to The Improverts .
The Improverts was adopted as a permanent , year-round name from September 1997 onwards . Since the show 's inception it has kept the Bedlam Theatre as its primary performance space , running weekly during Edinburgh University 's term time and then at the Edinburgh Fringe . Each year new players are recruited largely , though not exclusively , from the student population though every player must be a member of the Edinburgh University Theatre Company .
The troupe provides free weekly workshops in improvisation for the general public in order to attract new talent to the group .

Laine is the only female performer to have received Grammy nominations in the jazz , popular and classical music categories . She is the widow of jazz composer Sir John Dankworth .
Alperton is a London Underground station on the Uxbridge branch of the Piccadilly Line . The station is between Sudbury Town and Park Royal . It is located on Ealing Road -LRB- A4089 road -RRB- a short distance from the junction with Bridgewater Road -LRB- A4005 -RRB- and is close to Alperton Bus Garage and the Paddington branch of the Grand Union Canal . The station is in Travelcard Zone 4 .
Perivale Alperton station was opened on June 28 , 1903 by the Metropolitan District Railway -LRB- MDR , now the District Line -RRB- on its new extension to South Harrow from Park Royal & Twyford Abbey . Park Royal & Twyford Abbey had itself opened five days earlier .

More delicately constructed than their modern counterparts , and featuring a softer , more flexible sound , they attracted a more sizeable repertoire of original chamber and vocal music than many instruments contemporary with them .
Tarja Turunen -LRB- born 17 August 1977 -RRB- , full name Tarja Soile Susanna Turunen Cabuli , is a Finnish singer-songwriter and composer , a light lyric soprano . She is best known as an original member and the former lead vocalist of Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish , founded by herself , Tuomas Holopainen and Erno Vuorinen in 1996 . Based on her vocal training , Turunen even sings metal songs using classical technique . Towards the turn of the millennium the combination of hard and fast guitar riffs with classical female lead vocals quickly aroused enthusiasm by critics and audience . This symphonic metal style soon was dubbed `` opera metal '' and inspired many other metal bands and singers .
Since her dismissal from the band on October 21 , 2005 by an open letter , Turunen devoted herself exclusively to her solo career as Tarja . In 2006 , she released a Christmas album called HenkÃ ys Ikuisuudesta , with a support classical tour in Finland and Russia . In 2007 , Turunen released My Winter Storm , an album with various styles , including alternative rock and symphonic metal , supported by the Storm World Tour . Turunen 's third album , What Lies Beneath , was released on September 1 , 2010 , and Turunen performed several concerts in Europe , playing in famous metal festivals including the Graspop Metal Meeting and the Wacken Open Air , with more dates expected to be confirmed in the near future .
Great Zimbabwe is a ruined city that was once the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe , which existed from 1100 to 1450 AD during the countryâ s Late Iron Age . The monument , which first began to be constructed in the 11th century and which continued to be built until the 14th century , spanned an area of 722 hectares -LRB- 1,784 acres -RRB- and at its peak could have housed up to 18,000 people . Great Zimbabwe acted as a royal palace for the Zimbabwean monarch and would have been used as the seat of their political power . One of its most prominent features were its walls , some of which were over five metres high and which were constructed without mortar .
Eventually , the city was largely abandoned , and fell into ruin , first being encountered by Europeans in the early 16th century . Investigation of the site first began in the 19th century , when the monument caused great controversy amongst the archaeological world , with political pressure being placed upon archaeologists by the-then white supremacist government of Rhodesia to deny that it could have ever been produced by native Zimbabweans . Great Zimbabwe has since been adopted as a national monument by the Zimbabwean government , with the modern state being named after it . The word `` Great '' distinguishes the site from the many hundreds of small ruins , known as Zimbabwes , spread across the Zimbabwe highveld . There are 200 such sites in southern Africa , such as Bumbusi in Zimbabwe and Manekweni in Mozambique , with monumental , mortarless walls and Great Zimbabwe is the largest .
There are two theories on the origin of the word `` Zimbabwe '' : The first theory holds that the word is derived from Dzimba-dza-mabwe , translated from the Karanga dialect of Shona as `` large houses of stone '' -LRB- dzimba = plural of imba , `` house '' ; mabwe = plural of bwe , `` stone '' -RRB- . The Karanga-speaking Shona people are found around Great Zimbabwe in the modern -- day province of Masvingo and have been known to have inhabited the region since the building of this ancient city . A second theory is that Zimbabwe is a contracted form of dzimba-hwe which means `` venerated houses '' in the Zezuru dialect of Shona , and is usually applied to chiefs ' houses or graves .
The Great Zimbabwe area was settled by the fourth century . Between the fourth and the seventh centuries , communities now identified as Gokomere or Ziwa culture farmed the valley , mined and worked iron , but built no stone structures . These are the earliest iron age settlements in the area identified from archaeological diggings .
Construction of the stone buildings started in the 11th century and continuing for over 300 years , the ruins at Great Zimbabwe are some of the oldest and largest structures located in Southern Africa , and are the second oldest after nearby Mapungubwe in South Africa . Its most formidable edifice , commonly referred to as the Great Enclosure , has walls as high as 36 f extending approximately 820 f , making it the largest ancient structure south of the Sahara Desert . The city and its state , the Kingdom of Zimbabwe , flourished from 1200 to 1500 and its growth has been linked to the decline of Mapungubwe from around 1300 , due to climatic change or the greater availability of gold in the hinterland of Great Zimbabwe . At its peak , estimates are that Great Zimbabwe had as many as 18,000 inhabitants . The ruins that survive are built entirely of stone . The ruins span 1,800 acres -LRB- 7 kmÂ -RRB- and cover a radius of 100 to 200 miles -LRB- 160 to 320 km -RRB- .

He was drafted by the Ravens in the third round of the 2008 NFL Draft . He played college football for the University of Notre Dame from 2003 to 2007 .
Gura Humorului -LRB- Hebrew and Yiddish : ' '' -- - Gurâ Humuruluei or ' '' '' '' - Gur ' Humura ; German and Polish : Gura Humora -RRB- is a town located in northern Romania , Suceava County in southern Bukovina . Until 1918 it was in the Austro-Hungarian Empire , and formed a shtetl . It has a population of 15,837 .
According to the 1775 Austrian Bukovina census , its population comprised only about 60,000 spread over 10,422 square kilometers . In order to encourage the development of this sparsely-settled land , the authorities subsidized the immigration of colonists to Bukovina . With the end of the first wave of settlement , colonists were to continue arriving at their own expense . As a result of these policies , the census of 1910 showed that the population had risen to over 800,000 . People of many different ethnic groups took part in this immigration , including Germans , Armenians , Hungarians , Ukrainians , Poles , Romanians , and Jews .
No Jews lived in Gura Humorului before 1835 , when they were allowed to settle - joining other , already represented , ethnic groups -LRB- such as Germans from Bohemia , mainly from the BÃ hmerwald : thirty families settled on the mountainous and densely forested lands nearby the town , establishing a quarter named Bori -RRB- . The Jewish community began to flourish in 1869 , when they formed around a third of the town 's population -LRB- 880 people -RRB- ; the same year , a Beth midrash was established .
Schilde is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Antwerp . The municipality comprises the towns of Schilde proper and 's Gravenwezel . On January 1 , 2006 Schilde had a total population of 19,575 . The total area is 35.99 kmÂ which gives a population density of 544 inhabitants per kmÂ . It has one of the highest per capita income levels in Flanders .
In classical mechanics , momentum -LRB- pl . momenta ; SI unit kgÂ m\/s , or , equivalently , NÂ s -RRB- is the product of the mass and velocity of an object -LRB- p = mv -RRB- . Like velocity , momentum is a vector quantity , possessing a direction as well as a magnitude . Momentum is a conserved quantity -LRB- law of conservation of linear momentum -RRB- , meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces , its total momentum can not change . Momentum is sometimes referred to as linear momentum to distinguish it from the related subject of angular momentum .
Although originally expressed in Newton 's Second Law , the conservation of momentum also holds in special relativity and , with appropriate definitions , a -LRB- generalized -RRB- momentum conservation law holds in electrodynamics , quantum mechanics , quantum field theory , and general relativity . In relativistic mechanics , non-relativistic momentum is further multiplied by the Lorentz factor .
MÅ mentum was not merely the motion , which was mÅ tus , but was the power residing in a moving object , captured by today 's mathematical definitions . A mÅ tus , `` movement '' , was a stage in any sort of change , while velocitas , `` swiftness '' , captured only speed . The concept of momentum in classical mechanics was originated by a number of great thinkers and experimentalists . The first of these was Byzantine philosopher John Philoponus , in his commentary to AristotleÂ s Physics . As regards the natural motion of bodies falling through a medium , Aristotle 's verdict that the speed is proportional to the weight of the moving bodies and indirectly proportional to the density of the medium is disproved by Philoponus through appeal to the same kind of experiment that Galileo was to carry out centuries later . This idea was refined by the European philosophers Peter Olivi and Jean Buridan . Buridan referred to impetus being proportional to the weight times the speed . Moreover , BuridanÂ s theory was different to his predecessorÂ s in that he did not consider impetus to be self dissipating , asserting that a body would be arrested by the forces of air resistance and gravity which might be opposing its impetus .
RenÃ Descartes believed that the total `` quantity of motion '' in the universe is conserved , where the quantity of motion is understood as the product of size and speed . This should not be read as a statement of the modern law of momentum , since he had no concept of mass as distinct from weight and size , and more importantly he believed that it is speed rather than velocity that is conserved . So for Descartes if a moving object were to bounce off a surface , changing its direction but not its speed , there would be no change in its quantity of motion . Galileo , later , in his Two New Sciences , used the Italian word `` impeto '' .
The extent to which Isaac Newton contributed to the concept has been much debated . The answer is apparently nothing , except to state more fully and with better mathematics what was already known . Yet for scientists , this was the death knell for Aristotelian physics and supported other progressive scientific theories -LRB- i.e. , Kepler 's laws of planetary motion -RRB- . Conceptually , the first and second of Newton 's Laws of Motion had already been stated by John Wallis in his 1670 work , Mechanica sive De Motu , Tractatus Geometricus : `` the initial state of the body , either of rest or of motion , will persist '' and `` If the force is greater than the resistance , motion will result '' . Wallis uses momentum and vis for force . Newton 's PhilosophiÃ Naturalis Principia Mathematica , when it was first published in 1687 , showed a similar casting around for words to use for the mathematical momentum . His Definition II defines quantitas motus , `` quantity of motion '' , as `` arising from the velocity and quantity of matter conjointly '' , which identifies it as momentum . Thus when in Law II he refers to mutatio motus , `` change of motion '' , being proportional to the force impressed , he is generally taken to mean momentum and not motion . It remained only to assign a standard term to the quantity of motion . The first use of `` momentum '' in its proper mathematical sense is not clear but by the time of Jenning 's Miscellanea in 1721 , four years before the final edition of Newton 's Principia Mathematica , momentum M or `` quantity of motion '' was being defined for students as `` a rectangle '' , the product of Q and V , where Q is `` quantity of material '' and V is `` velocity '' , s\/t .
Some languages , such as French still lack a single term for momentum , and use a phrase such as the literal translation of `` quantity of motion '' . In Bulgarian and in Dutch the linear momentum is typically referred to as impulse , while the angular momentum is called momentum and the impulse has no distinct name .
If an object is moving in any reference frame , then it has momentum in that frame . It is important to note that momentum is frame dependent . That is , the same object may have a certain momentum in one frame of reference , but a different amount in another frame . For example , a moving object has momentum in a reference frame fixed to a spot on the ground , while at the same time having 0 momentum in a reference frame attached to the object 's center of mass.
The amount of momentum that an object has depends on two physical quantities : the mass and the velocity of the moving object in the frame of reference . In physics , the usual symbol for momentum is a bold p -LRB- bold because it is a vector -RRB- ; so this can be written
The Burmese language -LRB- ; ; MLCTS : myanma bhasa -RRB- is the official language of Burma . Although the constitution officially recognizes it as the Myanmar language , most English speakers continue to refer to the language as Burmese . Burmese is the native language of the Bamar and related sub-ethnic groups of the Bamar , as well as that of some ethnic minorities in Burma like the Mon. . Burmese is spoken by 32 million as a first language and as a second language by 10 million , particularly ethnic minorities in Burma and those in neighboring countries .
Burmese is a tonal and pitch-register , largely monosyllabic and analytic language , with a Subject Object Verb word order . It is a member of the Tibeto-Burman language family , which is a subfamily of the Sino-Tibetan family of languages . The language uses the Burmese script , derived from the Old Mon script and ultimately from the BrÄ hmÄ `` script .
Burmese language , literary and spoken , is called -LRB- mranma bhasa -RRB- , with -LRB- from Pali bhasa , `` language '' -RRB- . The language is classified into two categories . One is formal , used in literary works , official publications , radio broadcasts , and formal speeches . The other is colloquial , used in daily conversation and spoken . This is reflected in the Burmese words for `` language '' : -LRB- ca -RRB- refers to written , literary language , and -LRB- ca . ka : -RRB- refers to spoken language . Burmese therefore can mean either mranma ca -LRB- written Burmese -RRB- , or mranma ca . ka : -LRB- spoken Burmese -RRB- . The -LRB- mranma -RRB- portion of these names may be pronounced or , more colloquially , .
Diglossia occurs to a large extent in Burmese and is fairly noticeable in writing and speech . The written\/literary form of Burmese has undergone only a few changes and tends not to accommodate the spoken\/colloquial phonology of standard Burmese today . The Burmese saying `` the pronunciation is merely the sound , whilst the orthography is correct '' reflects the differences between spoken and written Burmese , as spelling is often not an accurate reflection of pronunciation .
In addition , different particles -LRB- to modify nouns and verbs -RRB- are used in the literary form from those used in the spoken form . Due to innate pronunciation rules , literate Burmese speakers are able to intuitively interpret ancient Burmese despite the potentially ancient nature of the inscriptions . For example , the postposition after nouns is -LRB- hnai . in formal Burmese , and -LRB- hma -RRB- in colloquial Burmese .
A newer system of orthography for Burmese -LRB- one based on phonology -RRB- has been proposed to accommodate such differences , but an obstacle in reforming Burmese orthography lies in the existence of conservative Burmese dialects that retain older pronunciations more similar to formal Burmese , which primarily come from coastal areas like Rakhine State . Moreover , some Burmese linguists such as Minn Latt , a Czech academic , have proposed shifting away from formal Burmese , as seen in television broadcasts , which use the colloquial form . However , formal Burmese remains well-established in Burmese society .
Since the mid-1960s , there has been a reform movement by some Burmese writers -LRB- in particular , leftist writers who believe that laymen 's language ought to be used -RRB- to abandon the formal style in favor of the vernacular style in writing , but the formal style remains the preferred form of Burmese writing , because `` the spoken style lacks gravity , authority , dignity '' . The formal written style is used in Burmese literature , radio news broadcasts , formal letters , novels , journalism and scholarly works .
Colloquial Burmese has various politeness levels that take status and age of the speaker in relation to the audience into consideration . For instance , the first and second person pronouns -LRB- nga ; `` I ; me '' -RRB- and -LRB- nang ; `` you '' -RRB- are used with only close people of the same or younger age . The use of these two pronouns with the elders and strangers is considered extremely rude or vulgar . To address elders , teachers and strangers , polite speech employs feudal-era third person pronouns in lieu of first and second person pronouns .

In spiritual terminology , piety is a virtue . While different people may understand its meaning differently , it is generally used to refer either to religious devotion or to spirituality , or often , a combination of both . A common element in most conceptions of piety is humility .
Robert Lee Dodd -LRB- November 11 , 1908 -- June 21 , 1988 -RRB- was an American college football coach at Georgia Tech . He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player and coach , something that only three people have accomplished .
Bobby Dodd was born in Galax , Virginia . From there , he moved to Kingsport , Tennessee and excelled at several sports at Dobyns-Bennett High School . After playing quarterback at the University of Tennessee , he served as an assistant coach under Bill Alexander at Georgia Tech beginning in 1931 . Alexander made the hire while Dodd was still a student at Tennessee . Dodd succeeded Alexander in 1945 as the third head coach at the Institute . He retired from coaching after the 1966 season , compiling a 165 -- 64 -- 8 record . He also served as Athletic Director from 1950 until 1976 . All told , Dodd spent 45 years at Tech in various capacities . Bobby Dodd died in June 1988 at the age of 79 in Atlanta , Georgia .
Bobby Dodd was a quarterback for the Tennessee Volunteers football team from 1928 to 1930 , where he was a member of Sigma Nu Fraternity , playing under legendary coach Robert Neyland . Dodd wanted to play for Georgia Tech but was not offered a scholarship . Ironically , he would later go on the coach the Yellow Jackets . In the games that Dodd started at UT , the Vols held a record of 27 -- 1 -- 2 .
Dodd was a difference in one famous game . During his sophomore year , in his first game of The Third Saturday in October rivalry against Alabama played in Tuscaloosa , `` Dodd threw a touchdown pass in that game to tie Alabama , 13 -- 13 . Then he punted out of bounds inside the Alabama 1-yard line and Tennessee got a safety on the next play to win , 15 -- 13 . ''
Another instance in Dodd 's career foreshadowed the creativity he would use in his coaching career . `` Against Florida in 1930 he got his teammates in a huddle and told them about a play he had used in high school -LRB- Dobyns-Bennett -RRB- . When the ball was snapped , it was placed on the ground unattended . The players ran in one direction . Then the center returned , picked up the ball , and waltzed to the winning touchdown . '' Tennessee fans even developed a catch phrase for Dodd during his time there : `` In Dodd we trust . ''
Dodd was named to Grantland Rice 's All American team in 1930 , making him the 2nd granted that honor at Tennessee -LRB- following Gene McEver -RRB- . In 1959 , Dodd was named to the University of Tennessee 's Hall of Fame and to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player . He was elected in the same year as teammate Herman Hickman .
Bobby Dodd compiled a 165 -- 64 -- 8 record as head coach at Georgia Tech . He led Georgia Tech to two Southeastern Conference -LRB- SEC -RRB- championships -LRB- 1951 and 1952 -RRB- and one national championship in 1952 . Under Dodd 's leadership , Tech played in 13 major bowls , winning 9 , including six in a row from 1952 to 1956 , and had a 31-game winning streak from 1951 to 1953 .
Dodd took over the Georgia Tech football program following Coach Alexander 's retirement in 1944 . Dodd 's coaching philosophy revolved around player treatment and character development . He did not believe in intense physical practices but rather precise and well executed practices . Dodd 's philosophy translated to winning . He set the record for career wins at Tech at 165 career coaching wins including a 31-game winning streak from 1951 -- 1953 . He also managed to capture two Southeastern Conference Titles and the 1952 National Title , which concluded a 12 -- 0 perfect season and Sugar Bowl conquest of Ole Miss.
Dodd also understood the deep-seated rivalry with the University of Georgia . His teams won 8 games in a row over the Bulldogs from 1946 -- 1954 outscoring the Bulldogs 176 -- 39 during the winning streak . This 8 â `` game winning streak is still the longest winning streak for either side in the series . Dodd would finish his career with a 12 -- 9 record against the Bulldogs .
Dodd 's tenure included Georgia Tech 's withdrawal from the Southeastern Conference . The initial spark for Dodd 's withdrawal was a historic feud with Alabama Crimson Tide Coach Bear Bryant . The feud began when Tech was visiting the Tide at Denny Stadium in 1961 . After a Tech punt , Alabama fair-caught the ball . Chick Granning of Tech was playing coverage and relaxed after the signal for the fair catch . Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and smashed his elbow into Granning 's face causing severe fracturing in his face , a broken nose , and blood-filled sinuses . Granning was knocked unconscious and suffered a severe concussion , the result of which left him unable to play football ever again . Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt after game film indicated Holt had intentionally injured Granning . Bryant never suspended Holt . The lack of discipline infuriated Dodd and sparked Dodd 's interest in withdrawing from the SEC .
Another issue of concern for Dodd was Alabama 's and other SEC schools ' over-recruitment of players . Universities would recruit more players than they had roster space for . During the summer practice sessions , the teams in question would cut the players well after signing day thus preventing the cut players from finding new colleges to play for . Dodd appealed the SEC administration to punish the `` tryout camps '' of his fellow SEC members but the SEC did not . Finally , Dodd withdrew Georgia Tech from the SEC in 1963 . Tech would remain an independent like Notre Dame and Penn State -LRB- at the time -RRB- during the final four years of Dodd 's coaching tenure . In 1967 , Dodd passed the head coach position to his favorite coordinator , Bud Carson . Dodd simply retained his athletic director position , which he had acquired in 1950 . He stepped down as athletic director in 1976 . In 1983 , he expressed interest in running a United States Football League team if Atlanta were awarded one , but the league folded before Atlanta received a team .
While Bobby Dodd was a determined competitor , he cared deeply for those who played for him . Unlike some other coaches , he did not believe in winning at any costs ; he truly believed that the most important aspect of college football was the college football player .
As a testament to the character of Bobby Dodd , each year a Division I college coach who has demonstrated leadership both on and off the field is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award , presented by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation . He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1959 and as a coach in 1993 . In 1988 , Georgia Tech named its stadium Bobby Dodd Stadium in honor of the legendary coach . The Bobby Dodd Institute is an organization that helps people with disabilities ; it is named in honor of Coach Dodd for his assistance to the disabled .
David Crockett -LRB- August 17 , 1786 â `` March 6 , 1836 -RRB- was a celebrated 19th-century American folk hero , frontiersman , soldier and politician . He is referred to in popular culture as Davy Crockett and after the 1950s by the epithet â King of the Wild Frontier . â He represented Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives , served in the Texas Revolution , and died at the Battle of the Alamo .
Crockett grew up in East Tennessee , where he gained a reputation for hunting and storytelling . After being elected to the rank of colonel in the militia of Lawrence County , Tennessee , he was elected to the Tennessee state legislature in 1821 . In 1826 , Crockett was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives . Congressman Crockett vehemently opposed many of the policies of President Andrew Jackson , most notably the Indian Removal Act . Crockett 's opposition to Jackson 's policies led to his defeat in the 1834 elections , prompting his angry departure to Texas shortly thereafter . In early 1836 , Crockett took part in the Texas Revolution and was killed at the Battle of the Alamo in March .
Crockett became famous in his own lifetime for larger-than-life exploits popularized by stage plays and almanacs . After his death , he continued to be credited with brazen acts of mythical proportion . These led in the 20th century to television and movie portrayals , and he became one of the best-known American folk heroes .
David Crockett was born in what is now Greene County , Tennessee , close to the Nolichucky River and near the community of Limestone . At the time of his birth , however , the surrounding area was part of the autonomous territory known as the State of Franklin . A replica of his birthplace cabin stands in Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park on the Nolichucky River near Limestone .
Crockett was of Scots-Irish , Anglo-Irish , French Huguenot and English descent , the family name being derived from Monsieur de la Croquetagne , a captain in the Royal Guard of French King Louis XIV . The family converted to Protestantism and , as Huguenots fled France in the 17th century , settled in the north of Ireland . Family tradition says that David Crockett 's father was born on the voyage to America from Ireland , though in fact Crockett 's great-grandfather , William David Crockett , was registered as having been born in New Rochelle , New York in 1709 .
David Crockett was the fifth of nine children of John and Rebecca -LRB- Hawkins -RRB- Crockett . He was named after his paternal grandfather , who was killed in 1777 at his home near today 's Rogersville , Tennessee , by Indians led by Dragging Canoe . Crockett 's father was one of the Overmountain Men who fought in the Battle of Kings Mountain during the American Revolutionary War . The Crocketts moved to Morristown , Tennessee , in the 1790s and built a tavern there . A museum stands on the site and is housed in a reconstruction of the tavern .
In his autobiography , Crockett told that his early years were filled with adventure , hardship , and travel . When he was 8 years old , he told his father he wanted to hunt with a rifle . His father said he could not afford to waste ammunition on `` a boy 's missed shots '' . Crockett promised to make every shot count , and began hunting with his older brothers . After being sent to school , he dropped out to run away from home to avoid a beating at the hands of his father when he was 13 . Crockett said he had `` whupped the tar '' out of a school bully who had embarrassed him on his first day in school . Crockett decided not to return to school for the next few days , fearing the bully would return with some friends backing him up , as well as the teacher 's punishments . The teacher eventually wrote to Crockett 's father to ask why his son did not attend class . Crockett told his father the truth . Angry that family trade goods exchanged for his son 's education had gone to waste , he refused to listen . Crockett ran away from home and spent three years roaming from town to town . He claimed he visited most of the towns and villages in Tennessee and learned his skills as a backwoodsman , hunter and trapper .
Near his 16th birthday , David Crockett returned home . Before Crockett had left , his father had opened a tavern on the road between Knoxville , Tennessee and Abingdon , Virginia . Crockett stopped in for a meal unannounced . The first to finally recognize him , his older sister , Betsy , cried , `` Here is my lost brother ! Look ! He is home ! '' The family was delighted and he was welcomed back . His father was in debt , so he hired Davy out to Abraham Wilson to settle a debt of $ 36 . Later , Crockett generously worked off a $ 40 debt to John Kennedy . In return , John Crockett told his son he was free to leave . Davy went to work again for Kennedy , this time working for himself .
Shortly afterwards , Crockett became engaged to Margaret Elder and , although the marriage never took place , the contract of marriage -LRB- dated October 21 , 1805 -RRB- has been preserved by the Dandridge , Tennessee , courthouse . It is well documented that Crockett 's bride-to-be changed her mind and married someone else . Heartbroken at age 19 , Crockett decided he was `` only born for hardships , misery , and disappointment '' .
On August 16 , 1806 , one day before his 20th birthday , Crockett married Mary -LRB- Polly -RRB- Finley in Jefferson County , Tennessee . They had two sons : John Wesley Crockett was born July 10 , 1807 , followed by William Finley Crockett -LRB- born 1809 -RRB- . They also had a daughter , Margaret Finley -LRB- Polly -RRB- Crockett in 1812 . After his wife Polly 's death , Crockett married a widow named Elizabeth Patton in 1815 ; they had three children : Robert , Rebecca and Matilda .

AknÄ `` ste is a town in AknÄ `` ste municipality , Selonia , in the southern portion of Latvia , near the Lithuanian border . The town is located near the river Dienvidsuseja . For the first time name Akniste had been mentioned in year 1298 . Town was a part of Lithuania for few centuries -LRB- starting with 17th century -RRB- , but at the beginning of the 20th century Lithuania exchanged Akniste for Palanga .
Guillaume Dufay -LRB- Du Fay , Du Fayt -RRB- -LRB- August 5 , 1397 ? -- November 27 , 1474 -RRB- was a Franco-Flemish composer of the early Renaissance . As the central figure in the Burgundian School , he was the most famous and influential composer in Europe in the mid-15th century .
From the evidence of his will , he was probably born in Beersel , in the vicinity of Brussels . Circumstantial evidence claims him to have been born the illegitimate child of an unknown priest and a woman named Marie Du Fayt , though this suggestion is as of yet unproven . Marie moved with her son to Cambrai early in his life , staying with a relative who was a canon of the cathedral there . Soon Dufay 's musical gifts were noticed by the cathedral authorities , who evidently gave him a thorough training in music ; he studied with Rogier de Hesdin during the summer of 1409 , and he was listed as a choirboy in the cathedral from 1409 to 1412 . During those years he studied with Nicolas Malin , and the authorities must have been impressed with the boy 's gifts because they gave him his own copy of Villedieuâ s Doctrinale in 1411 , a highly unusual event for one so young . In June 1414 , at the age of only 16 , he had already been given a benefice as chaplain at St. GÃ ry , immediately adjacent to Cambrai . Later that year he probably went to the Council of Konstanz , staying possibly until 1418 , at which time he returned to Cambrai .
From November 1418 to 1420 he was a subdeacon at Cambrai Cathedral . In 1420 he left Cambrai again , this time going to Rimini , and possibly Pesaro , where he worked for the Malatesta family . Although no records survive of his employment there , several compositions of his can be dated to this period ; they contain references that make a residence in Italy reasonably certain . It was there that he met the composers Hugo and Arnold de Lantins , who were among the musicians of the Malatesta household . In 1424 Dufay again returned to Cambrai , this time because of the illness and subsequent death of the relative with whom his mother was staying . By 1426 , however , he had gone back to Italy , this time to Bologna , where he entered the service of Cardinal Louis Aleman , the papal legate . While in Bologna he became a deacon , and by 1428 he was a priest . Cardinal Aleman was driven from Bologna by the rival Canedoli family in 1428 , and Dufay also left at this time , going to Rome . He became a member of the Papal Choir , serving first Pope Martin V , and then after the death of Pope Martin in 1431 , Pope Eugene IV . In 1434 he was appointed maistre de chappelle in Savoy , where he served Duke AmÃ dÃ e VIII ; evidently he left Rome because of a crisis in the finances of the papal choir , and to escape the turbulence and uncertainty during the struggle between the papacy and the Council of Basel . Yet in 1435 he was again in the service of the papal chapel , but this time it was in Florence -- Pope Eugene having been driven from Rome in 1434 by the establishment of an insurrectionary republic there , sympathetic to the Council of Basel and the Conciliar movement . In 1436 Dufay composed the festive motet Nuper rosarum flores , one of his most famous compositions , which was sung at the dedication of Brunelleschi 's dome of the cathedral in Florence , where Eugene lived in exile .
During this period Dufay also began his long association with the Este family in Ferrara , some of the most important musical patrons of the Renaissance , and with which he probably had become acquainted during the days of his association with the Malatesta family ; Rimini and Ferrara are not only geographically close , but the two families were related by marriage , and Dufay composed at least one ballade for NiccolÃ III , Marquis of Ferrara . In 1437 Dufay visited the town . When NiccolÃ died in 1441 , the next Marquis maintained the contact with Dufay , and not only continued financial support for the composer but copied and distributed some of his music .
The struggle between the papacy and the Council of Basel continued through the 1430s , and evidently Dufay realized that his own position might be threatened by the spreading conflict , especially since Pope Eugene was deposed in 1439 by the Council and replaced by Duke AmÃ dÃ e of Savoy himself , as Pope -LRB- Antipope -RRB- Felix V. At this time Dufay returned to his homeland , arriving in Cambrai by December of that year . In order to be a canon at Cambrai , he needed a law degree , which he obtained in 1437 ; he may have studied at University of Turin in 1436 . One of the first documents mentioning him in Cambrai is dated December 27 , 1440 , when he received a delivery of 36 lots of wine for the feast of St. John the Evangelist .
Dufay was to remain in Cambrai through the 1440s , and during this time he was also in the service of the Duke of Burgundy . While in Cambrai he collaborated with Nicolas Grenon on a complete revision of the liturgical musical collection of the cathedral , which included writing an extensive collection of polyphonic music for services . In addition to his musical work , he was active in the general administration of the cathedral . In 1444 his mother Marie died , and was buried in the cathedral ; and in 1445 Dufay moved into the house of the previous canon , which was to remain his primary residence for the rest of his life .
After the abdication of the last antipope -LRB- Felix V -RRB- in 1449 , his own former employer Duke AmÃ dÃ e VIII of Savoy , the struggle between different factions within the Church began to heal , and Dufay once again left Cambrai for points south . He went to Turin in 1450 , shortly before the death of Duke AmÃ dÃ e , but returned to Cambrai later that year ; and in 1452 he went back to Savoy yet again . This time he did not return to Cambrai for six years , and during that time he attempted to find either a benefice or an employment which would allow him to stay in Italy . Numerous compositions , including one of the four Lamentationes that he composed on the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 , his famous mass based on Se la face ay pale , as well as a letter to Lorenzo de ' Medici , survive from this period : but as he was unable to find a satisfactory position for his retirement , he returned north in 1458 . While in Savoy he served more-or-less officially as choirmaster for Louis , Duke of Savoy , but he was more likely in a ceremonial role , since the records of the chapel never mention him .
When he returned to Cambrai for his final years , he was appointed canon of the cathedral . He was now the most renowned composer in Europe . Once again he established close ties to the court of Burgundy , and continued to compose music for them ; in addition he received many visitors , including Busnois , Ockeghem , Tinctoris , and Loyset CompÃ re , all of whom were decisive in the development of the polyphonic style of the next generation . During this period he probably wrote his mass based on L'homme armÃ , as well as the chanson on the same song ; the latter composition may have been inspired by Philip the Good 's call for a new crusade against the Turks , who had recently captured Constantinople . He also wrote a Requiem mass around 1460 , which is lost .
After an illness of several weeks , Dufay died on November 27 , 1474 . He had requested that his motet Ave regina celorum be sung for him as he died , with pleas for mercy interpolated between verses of the antiphon , but time was insufficient for this to be arranged . Dufay was buried in the chapel of St. Etienne in the cathedral of Cambrai ; his portrait was carved onto his tombstone . After the destruction of the cathedral the tombstone was lost , but it was found in 1859 -LRB- it was being used to cover a well -RRB- , and is now in the Palais des Beaux Arts museum in Lille .
Dufay was among the most influential composers of the 15th century , and his music was copied , distributed and sung everywhere that polyphony had taken root . Almost all composers of the succeeding generations absorbed some elements of his style . The wide distribution of his music is all the more impressive considering that he died several decades before the availability of music printing .
Apollo -LRB- Attic , Ionic , and Homeric Greek : á 1\/4 Ï Ï Î '' Î '' Ï Î 1\/2 , ApollÅ n -LRB- gen. : á 1\/4 Ï Ï Î '' Î '' Ï Î 1\/2 Î Ï -RRB- ; Doric : á 1\/4 Ï Î Î '' Î '' Ï Î 1\/2 , ApellÅ n ; Arcadocypriot : á 1\/4 Ï Î Î Î '' Ï Î 1\/2 , ApeilÅ n ; Aeolic : á 1\/4 Ï Î '' Î Ï Î 1\/2 , Aploun ; -RRB- is one of the most important and diverse of the Olympian deities in Greek and Roman mythology . The ideal of the kouros -LRB- a beardless , athletic youth -RRB- , Apollo has been variously recognized as a god of light and the sun ; truth and prophecy ; medicine , healing , and plague ; music , poetry , and the arts ; and more . Apollo is the son of Zeus and Leto , and has a twin sister , the chaste huntress Artemis . Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu . Apollo was worshiped in both ancient Greek and Roman religion , as well as in the modern Grecoâ `` Roman Neopaganism .
As the patron of Delphi -LRB- Pythian Apollo -RRB- , Apollo was an oracular godâ '' the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle . Medicine and healing were associated with Apollo , whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius , yet Apollo was also seen as a god who could bring ill-health and deadly plague . Amongst the god 's custodial charges , Apollo became associated with dominion over colonists , and as the patron defender of herds and flocks . As the leader of the Muses -LRB- Apollon Musegetes -RRB- and director of their choir , Apollo functioned as the patron god of music and poetry . Hermes created the lyre for him , and the instrument became a common attribute of Apollo . Hymns sung to Apollo were called paeans .
In Hellenistic times , especially during the 3rd century BCE , as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios , Titan god of the sun , and his sister Artemis similarly equated with Selene , Titan goddess of the moon . In Latin texts , on the other hand , Joseph Fontenrose declared himself unable to find any conflation of Apollo with Sol among the Augustan poets of the 1st century , not even in the conjurations of Aeneas and Latinus in Aeneid XII -LRB- 161 â `` 215 -RRB- . Apollo and Helios\/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 3rd century CE .
The etymology of Apollo is uncertain . The spelling á 1\/4 Ï Ï Î '' Î '' Ï Î 1\/2 had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era , but the Doric form Î ` Ï Î Î '' Î '' Ï Î 1\/2 is more archaic , derived from an earlier \* Î ` Ï Î Î '' jÏ Î 1\/2 . The name is certainly cognate with the Doric month name Î ` Ï Î Î '' Î '' Î Î Î Ï and the Doric festival Î Ï Î Î '' Î '' Î Î .

The Banachâ `` Tarski paradox is a theorem in set theoretic geometry which states that a solid ball in 3-dimensional space can be split into a finite number of non-overlapping pieces , which can then be put back together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original ball . The reassembly process involves only moving the pieces around and rotating them , without changing their shape . However , the pieces themselves are complicated : they are not usual solids but infinite scatterings of points . A stronger form of the theorem implies that given any two `` reasonable '' objects -LRB- such as a small ball and a huge ball -RRB- , either one can be reassembled into the other . This is often stated colloquially as `` a pea can be chopped up and reassembled into the Sun '' .
The reason the Banachâ `` Tarski theorem is called a paradox is because it contradicts basic geometric intuition . `` Doubling the ball '' by dividing it into parts and moving them around by rotations and translations , without any stretching , bending , or adding new points , seems to be impossible , since all these operations preserve the volume , but the volume is doubled in the end .

Chesterfield is a market town and a borough of Derbyshire , England . It lies north of the city of Derby , on a confluence of the rivers Rother and Hipper . Including Staveley , the population -LRB- 2001 -RRB- is 100,879 , although that of the town itself is 70,260 . It is Derbyshire 's largest town , the larger Derby being a city . It is located on the A61 , 6 m from the M1 , and forms part of the Sheffield City Region .
The town received its market charter in the year 1204 from King John and around 250 stalls can still be found in the town center every Monday , Friday and Saturday . The charter constituted the town as a free borough , granting the burgesses of Chesterfield the same privileges as those of Nottingham .
Armenian illuminated manuscripts form a separate tradition , related to other forms of Medieval Armenian art , but also to the Byzantine tradition . The earliest surviving examples date from the Golden Age of Armenian art and literature in the 5th century . Early Armenian Illuminated manuscripts are remarkable for their festive designs to the Armenian culture ; they make one feel the power of art and the universality of its language . The greatest Armenian miniaturist , Toros Roslin , lived in the 13th century .
`` I Write Sins Not Tragedies '' is a song by American rock band Panic ! at the Disco , and is the second single from their debut studio album , A Fever You Ca n't Sweat Out . It was released on April 27 , 2006 on both compact disc and 7 inch vinyl . The song was written by Ryan Ross . The song reached # 7 on the United States Billboard Hot 100 . This is the band 's only top 40 hit in America .
Capsicum is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family , Solanaceae . Its species are native to the Americas , where they have been cultivated for thousands of years by the people of the tropical Americas , and are now cultivated worldwide . Some of the members of Capsicum are used as spices , vegetables , and medicines . The fruit of Capsicum plants have a variety of names depending on place and type . They are commonly called chilli pepper , red or green pepper , or sweet pepper in Britain , and typically just capsicum in Australia , New Zealand , and India . The large mild form is called bell pepper in the U.S. and Canada . They are called paprika in some other countries -LRB- although paprika can also refer to the powdered spice made from various capsicum fruit -RRB- . The generic name is derived from the Greek word Î Î Ï Ï Î -LRB- kapto -RRB- , meaning `` to bite '' or `` to swallow . ''
The original Mexican term , chilli -LRB- now chile in Mexico -RRB- came from the Nahuatl word chilli or xilli , referring to a larger Capsicum variety cultivated at least since 3000 BC , as evidenced by remains found in pottery from Puebla and Oaxaca .
The fruit of most species of Capsicum contains capsaicin -LRB- methyl vanillyl nonenamide -RRB- , a lipophilic chemical that can produce a strong burning sensation in the mouth of the unaccustomed eater . Most mammals find this unpleasant , whereas birds are unaffected . The secretion of capsaicin protects the fruit from consumption by mammals while the bright colors attract birds that will disperse the seeds .
Capsaicin is present in large quantities in the placental tissue -LRB- which holds the seeds -RRB- , the internal membranes and , to a lesser extent , the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in the genus Capsicum . Contrary to popular belief , the seeds themselves do not produce any capsaicin , although the highest concentration of capsaicin can be found in the white pith around the seeds .
The amount of capsaicin in Capsicums is highly variable and dependent on genetics and environment , giving almost all types of Capsicums varied amounts of perceived heat . The only Capsicum without capsaicin is the bell pepper , a cultivar of Capsicum annuum , which has a zero rating on the Scoville scale . The lack of capsaicin in bell peppers is due to a recessive gene that eliminates capsaicin and , consequently , the `` hot '' taste usually associated with the rest of the Capsicum family .
Chili peppers are of great importance in Native American medicine , and capsaicin is used in modern medicineâ '' mainly in topical medicationsâ '' as a circulatory stimulant and analgesic . In more recent times , an aerosol extract of capsaicin , usually known as capsicum or pepper spray , has become widely used by police forces as a non-lethal means of incapacitating a person , and in a more widely dispersed form for riot control , or by individuals for personal defense .
Although black pepper and Sichuan pepper cause similar burning sensations , they are caused by different substancesâ '' piperine and hydroxy-alpha sanshool , respectively .
Capsicum fruits and peppers can be eaten raw or cooked . Those used in cooking are generally varieties of the C. annuum and C. frutescens species , though a few others are used as well . They are suitable for stuffing with fillings such as cheese , meat or rice .
They are also frequently used both chopped and raw in salads , or cooked in stir-fries or other mixed dishes . They can be sliced into strips and fried , roasted whole or in pieces , or chopped and incorporated into salsas or other sauces .
They can be preserved in the form of a jam , or by drying , pickling or freezing . Dried peppers may be reconstituted whole , or processed into flakes or powders . Pickled or marinated peppers are frequently added to sandwiches or salads . Frozen peppers are used in stews , soups , and salsas . Extracts can be made and incorporated into hot sauces .
According to Richard Pankhurst , C. frutescens -LRB- known as barbarÃ -RRB- was so important to the national cuisine of Ethiopia , at least as early as the 19th century , `` that it was cultivated extensively in the warmer areas wherever the soil was suitable . '' Although it was grown in every province , barbarÃ was especially extensive in Yejju , `` which supplied much of Showa as well as other neighboring provinces . '' He singles out the upper Golima river valley as being almost entirely devoted to the cultivation of this plant , where thousands of acres were devoted to the plant and it was harvested year round .
In 2005 , a poll of 2,000 people revealed the capsicum pepper to be Britain 's 4th favorite culinary vegetable .
In Bulgaria , South Serbia and Macedonia , peppers are very popular , too . They can be eaten in salads , like Shopska Salata ; fried and then covered with a dip of tomato paste , onions , garlic , and parsley ; or stuffed with a variety of productsâ '' like minced meat and rice , beans , or cottage cheese and eggs . Peppers are also the main ingredient in the traditional tomato and pepper dipâ '' lyutenitsa and ajvar . They are in the base of different kinds of pickled vegetables dishesâ '' turshiya .
Peppers are also used widely in the Italian cuisine and the hot version is used all around the southern part of Italy as a common spice -LRB- sometimes it is served mixed with olive oil -RRB- . Capsicum pepper is used in many dishes ; it can be cooked itself in a variety of ways -LRB- roasted , fried , deepfried -RRB- and it is a fundamental ingredient for some delicattessen specialities , like Nduja .
Capsicums are also used extensively in Sri Lankan cuisine as side dishes .
Capsicum consists of approximately 20 â `` 27 species , five of which are domesticated : C. annuum , C. baccatum , C. chinense , C. frutescens , and C. pubescens . Phylogenetic relationships between species were investigated using biogeographical , morphological , chemosystematic , hybridization , and genetic data . Fruits of Capsicum can vary tremendously in color , shape , and size both between and within species , which has led to confusion over the relationships between taxa . Chemosystematic studies helped distinguish the difference between varieties and species . For example , C. baccatum var . baccatum had the same flavonoids as C. baccatum var . pendulum , which led researchers to believe that the two groups belonged to the same species .
Many varieties of the same species can be used in many different ways ; for example , C. annuum includes the `` bell pepper '' variety , which is sold in both its immature green state and its red , yellow or orange ripe state . This same species has other varieties as well , such as the Anaheim chiles often used for stuffing , the dried ancho chile used to make chili powder , the mild-to-hot jalapeÃ o , and the smoked , ripe jalapeÃ o , known as a chipotle .
Most of the capsaicin in a pungent -LRB- hot -RRB- pepper is concentrated in blisters on the epidermis of the interior ribs -LRB- septa -RRB- that divide the chambers of the fruit to which the seeds are attached . A study on capsaicin production in fruits of C. chinense showed that capsaicinoids are produced only in the epidermal cells of the interlocular septa of pungent fruits , that blister formation only occurs as a result of capsaicinoid accumulation , and that pungency and blister formation are controlled by a single locus , Pun1 , for which there exist at least two recessive alleles that result in non-pungency of C. chinense fruits .
The amount of capsaicin in hot peppers varies significantly between varieties , and is measured in Scoville heat units -LRB- SHU -RRB- . The world 's current hottest known pepper as rated in SHU is the Naga Viper pepper , which has been measured at 1,382,118 SHU .
The name given to the Capsicum fruits varies between English-speaking countries .
In Australia , New Zealand and India , heatless species are called `` capsicums '' while hot ones are called `` chilli\/chillies '' -LRB- double L -RRB- . Pepperoncini are also known as `` sweet capsicum '' . The term `` bell peppers '' is almost never used , although C. annuum and other varieties which have a bell-shape and are fairly hot , are often called `` bell chillies '' .
`` Dilemma '' is a song by the American rapper Nelly , a duet with R&B singer Kelly Rowland . The single was released in 2002 from the album Nellyville . In the 50th Anniversary of the Hot 100 issue of Billboard magazine , the song was ranked at number 64 on the all-time Hot 100 songs while at the end of 2009 was named the 11th most successful song from 2000 to 2009 , on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade . The song won a Grammy Award for Best Rap\/Sung Collaboration at the 45th Grammy Awards .

Rensselaer County is a county in the U.S. state of New York . As of the 2000 census , the population was 152,538 . Its name is in honor of the family of Kiliaen van Rensselaer , the original Dutch owner of the land in the area . Its county seat is Troy . It is part of the Albany-Schenectady-Troy Metropolitan Statistical Area .
The area that is now Rensselaer County was originally inhabited by the Mohican Indian tribe until it was bought by the Dutch jeweler and merchant Kiliaen van Rensselaer in 1630 and incorporated in his patroonship Rensselaerswyck -LRB- which , in turn , was part of the Dutch colony New Netherland -RRB- . The land passed into English hands in 1664 until the Dutch regained control for a year in 1673 , but the English took it back in 1674 . Until 1776 , the year of American independence , it was under English or British control . However , the county did n't actually exist as a legal entity until 1791 when it was created from land that was originally part of Albany County .
In 1807 , in a county re-organization , the rural sections of Troy were set off as towns , and the city itself was incorporated . The two towns created were Brunswick and Grafton , both named after British dukes , -LRB- the Duke of Brunswick and Duke of Grafton -RRB- . A third town , Philipstown , was set off in 1806 , but renamed in 1808 to Nassau after the Duke of Nassau .
Rensselaer County is in the eastern part of New York State . The eastern boundary of Rensselaer County runs along the New York-Vermont and New York-Massachusetts borders .
In astronomy , declination -LRB- abbrev . dec or Î -RRB- is one of the two coordinates of the equatorial coordinate system , the other being either right ascension or hour angle . Declination in astronomy is comparable to geographic latitude , but projected onto the celestial sphere . Declination is measured in degrees north and south of the celestial equator . Points north of the celestial equator have positive declinations , while those to the south have negative declinations .
Jaucourt is a commune in the Aube department in north-central France .
The raccoon -LRB- , Procyon lotor -RRB- , sometimes spelled as racoon , also known as the common raccoon , North American raccoon , northern raccoon and colloquially as coon , is a medium-sized mammal native to North America . It is the largest of the procyonid family , having a body length of 40 t and a body weight of 3.5 t. The raccoon is usually nocturnal and is omnivorous , with a diet consisting of about 40 % invertebrates , 33 % plant foods , and 27 % vertebrates . It has a grayish coat , of which almost 90 % is dense underfur , which insulates against cold weather . Two of its most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws and its facial mask , which are themes in the mythology of several Native American tribes . Raccoons are noted for their intelligence , with studies showing that they are able to remember the solution to tasks up to three years later .
The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests of North America , but due to their adaptability they have extended their range to mountainous areas , coastal marshes , and urban areas , where many homeowners consider them to be pests . As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century , raccoons are now also distributed across the European mainland , the Caucasus region and Japan .
Though previously thought to be solitary , there is now evidence that raccoons engage in gender-specific social behavior . Related females often share a common area , while unrelated males live together in groups of up to four animals to maintain their positions against foreign males during the mating season , and other potential invaders . Home range sizes vary anywhere from 3 hectares for females in cities to 50 km2 for males in prairies -LRB- 7 acres to 20 sq mi -RRB- . After a gestation period of about 65 days , two to five young -LRB- known as a `` kit '' , plural `` kits '' -RRB- are born in spring . The kits are subsequently raised by their mother until dispersion in late fall . Although captive raccoons have been known to live over 20 years , their average life expectancy in the wild is only 1.8 to 3.1 years . In many areas hunting and traffic accidents are the two most common causes of death .
New Lanark is a village on the River Clyde , approximately 1.4 miles -LRB- 2.2 kilometres -RRB- from Lanark , in South Lanarkshire , Scotland . It was founded in 1786 by David Dale , who built cotton mills and housing for the mill workers . Dale built the mills there to take advantage of the water power provided by the river . Under the ownership of a partnership that included Dale 's son-in-law , Robert Owen , a Welsh philanthropist and social reformer , New Lanark became a successful business and an epitome of utopian socialism .
The New Lanark mills operated until 1968 . After a period of decline , the New Lanark Conservation Trust -LRB- NLCT -RRB- was founded in 1975 to prevent demolition of the village . By 2006 most of the buildings have been restored and the village has become a major tourist attraction . It is one of five UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Scotland and an Anchor Point of ERIH - The European Route of Industrial Heritage .
Pulaski is a village in Brown , Oconto , and Shawano Counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin . The population was 3,060 at the 2000 census .

From May 1 , 2007 to December 16 , 2007 , the team was known as the Major Brothers , until they were repackaged and renamed to Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder as fans and associates of Edge on December 21 , 2007 , on an episode of SmackDown ! .
The Hispanidad is the community formed by all the people and countries that share a common Hispanic heritage and cultural pattern .
The 20 nations that are included are all Spanish-speaking countries . The community can be classified into three geographic areas : Hispanic Europe -LRB- Spain -RRB- , Hispanic America -LRB- Spanish-speaking America -RRB- , Hispanic Africa -LRB- Spanish-African territories , Equatorial Guinea -RRB- . A few countries in the Asia-Pacific region also have historical Spanish influence , although they no longer have Spanish as their official language .
Various countries celebrate October 12 as the DÃ a de la Hispanidad -LRB- `` Day of Hispanicity '' or `` Hispanic Day '' -RRB- is celebrated as a national holiday . Since 1987 Spain has celebrated this holiday as its Fiesta Nacional de EspaÃ a In the other nations of the community , the day is also celebrated as a commemoration of the date in 1492 when Christopher Columbus discovered America , marking the beginning of the diffusion of Spanish language and culture as well as its lasting impact on the New world .
Hispanidad or Spanish linguistic and cultural diffusion began on 12 October 1492 when Christopher Columbus initiated its European colonization of the Americas in the name of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain . The kingdom of Castile -LRB- Castilla -RRB- built a global empire , spreading its culture and language in the Americas and biologically and culturally mixing with the Indigenous peoples and ultimately , the African slaves , altering the composition of the hemisphere . The penetration and reach of Spain at this time also extended into other European nations .
In 1713 , the Real Academia EspaÃ ola was established to regulate written and spoken Spanish language throughout the empire so that it could be understood by all Hispanics . At the beginning of the 19th century , the American colonies ' dissatisfaction with the Spanish government and Napoleon 's invasion of Spain created an opportunity for revolution in America . All of the Spanish colonies obtained independence at this time , except Cuba , Puerto Rico and the Philippines . These three countries then became colonies of the United States after the Spanish-American War .
At the beginning of the 20th century , Hispanicity was moribund . ZacarÃ as de Vizarra , Faustino RodrÃ guez-San Pedro and Ramiro de Maeztu revived interest in the concept in Spain and the Americas , changing its name to Dia de la Raza or `` Day of the -LRB- New -RRB- Race '' . This was already a national celebration in many Hispanic countries , in honor of the meeting of Europeans and Amerindians , their mixing and the emergence of the mestizo race . Shortly thereafter , the first pan-Hispanic organizations such as the AsociaciÃ n de Academias de la Lengua EspaÃ ola began . With the restoration of democracy in Spain , all the Hispanic nations began to converge with , for example , the creation of the Cumbre Iberoamericana in 1991 . Since then , the number of Hispano-American , Ibero-American , Pan-Latin American organizations has increased .
Monstera is a genus of about 60 species of flowering plants in the family Araceae , native to tropical regions of the Americas . The genus is named from the Latin word for `` monstrous '' or `` abnormal '' , the members of the genus are distinguished by their unusual leaves with natural holes .
They are herbs or evergreen vines , growing to heights of 20 m in trees , climbing by means of aerial roots which act as hooks over branches ; these roots will also grow into the soil to help support the plant . The leaves are alternate , leathery , dark green , very large , from 25-90 cm long -LRB- up to 130 cm long in M. dubia -RRB- and 15-75 cm broad , often with holes in the leaf blade . The flowers are borne on a specialised inflorescence called a spadix , 5-45 cm long ; the fruit is a cluster of white berries , edible in some species .
They are commonly grown indoors as houseplants . The best-known representative of the genus , Monstera deliciosa , is also cultivated for its edible fruit which taste like a combination of banana and pineapple .
The Qin Dynasty was the first ruling dynasty of Imperial China , lasting from 221 to 206 BC . The Qin state derived its name from its heartland of Qin , in modern-day Shaanxi . The Qin 's strength had been consolidated by Lord Shang Yang in the 4th century BC , during the Warring States Period . In the early third century BC , the Qin accomplished a series of swift conquests ; the state subjugated the Chu , remnants of the Zhou Dynasty , and various other states to gain undisputed control of China .
A chopstick rest -LRB- ç å å Chinese : kuaizi zuo -RRB- is tableware , similar to a spoon rest , used to keep chopstick tips off the table and to prevent used chopsticks from contaminating or rolling off tables . Chopstick rests are found more commonly in restaurants than in homes . They come in various shapes and are made from clay , wood , glass , porcelain or precious stones such as jade . If the chopsticks come in paper sleeves , some people fold the sleeves into chopstick rests .
In Japan , chopstick rests are usually used at formal dinners and placed on the front-left side of the dishes . The chopsticks are placed parallel to the table edge with the points toward the left .
Izanagi is a deity born of the seven divine generations in Japanese mythology and Shinto , and is also referred to in the roughly translated Kojiki as `` male-who-invites '' or Izanagi-no-mikoto . It is also pronounced Izanaki-no-Okami .
He with his spouse and younger sister , Izanami , bore many islands , deities and forefathers of Japan . When Izanami died in childbirth , Izanagi tried -LRB- but failed -RRB- to retrieve her from Yomi -LRB- the underworld -RRB- . In the cleansing rite after his return , he begot Amaterasu -LRB- the sun goddess -RRB- from his left eye , Tsukuyomi -LRB- the moon god -RRB- from his right eye and Susanoo -LRB- tempest or storm god -RRB- from his nose .
`` Brain damage '' or `` brain injury '' -LRB- BI -RRB- is the destruction or degeneration of brain cells . Brain injuries occur due to a wide range of internal and external factors . A common category with the greatest number of injuries is traumatic brain injury -LRB- TBI -RRB- following physical trauma or head injury from an outside source , and the term acquired brain injury -LRB- ABI -RRB- is used in appropriate circles , to differentiate brain injuries occurring after birth from injury due to a disorder or congenital malady .
Louise Marie ThÃ rÃ se Bathilde d'Orl Ã ans , Princess of CondÃ -LRB- 9 July 1750 -- 10 January 1822 -RRB- , was a French princess . She was sister of Philippe Ã galitÃ , the mother of the executed duc d'Enghien and aunt of Louis-Philippe King of the French . She was known as Citoyenne VÃ ritÃ during the French Revolution .
Descended from both Louis XIV of France and his younger brother , Philippe de France , Duke of OrlÃ ans , Bathilde was born a princesse du sang .
Louise Marie ThÃ rÃ se Bathilde d'Orl Ã ans , was the daughter of the Louis Philippe d'Orl Ã ans , Duke of Chartres and his wife , Louise Henriette de Bourbon . Bathilde was born at the ChÃ cents teau de Saint-Cloud , some ten kilometers west of Paris , on 9 July 1750 . She was known unofficially at court as Mademoiselle - a style that had previously been held by a CondÃ cousin , Louise Anne de Bourbon -LRB- 1695 â `` 1758 -RRB- .
Her mother died in 1759 when Bathilde was just eight years old . Her father , pressured by his mistress , Madame de Montesson , sent her to a convent . During her time at the convent , she became a very spiritual person , a trait that would remain with her all her life .
Initially , Bathilde was considered as a possible bride for a distant cousin , Ferdinand , Duke of Parma , the favorite grandson of King Louis XV of France ; however , that marriage never materialised .
Finally , in 1770 , when she was twenty years old , she was allowed to leave the convent and marry her younger cousin , the duc de Bourbon , the son and heir of Louis Joseph de Bourbon , Prince of CondÃ and his wife Charlotte Ã lisabeth Godefride de Rohan .
Her husband was only fourteen at the time . Unfortunately , he tired of her rather quickly after only six months . Despite little contact , their periodic rapprochements eventually allowed her to give birth to a son :
The scandal of her husband 's adultery came out in 1778 , and the consequences fell entirely on her shoulders . The couple separated in 1780 . As a separated spouse , she was never received at court and was forced to reorganise her life in the gilded solitude of the ChÃ cents teau de Chantilly .
Later , she also lived for a time with her father and his second wife , Madame de Montesson , at their chÃ cents teau at Saint-Assise . When her father died , in 1785 , her brother Philippe , became the Duke of OrlÃ ans . It was around this time that Bathilde bought a house in Paris called the HÃ tel de Clermont and the chÃ cents teau de Petit-Bourg .
In her isolation , she discreetly had an illegitimate daughter with a marine officer . Later , she passed the child off as the daughter of her secretary , in order to keep the little girl close to her .
In 1787 , she purchased the Ã lysÃ e Palace from Louis XVI and had a hamlet constructed there ; inspired by the Hameau de Chantilly at her ChÃ cents teau de Chantilly , it was itself called the `` Hameau de Chantilly '' .
She lapsed from Christianity and devoted herself to the occult , studying the supernatural arts of chiromancy , astrology , dream interpretation , and animal magnetism . She spent time painting and raising her son . Her salon was renowned throughout Europe for its liberty of thought and the brilliant wits who frequented it .
During the French Revolution , just like her brother Philippe Ã galitÃ , Bathilde discovered democracy . She fell out with her royalist husband and son , who both chose to leave France after the storming of the Bastille . As the Ancien RÃ gime crumbled , she took the name , Citoyenne VÃ ritÃ -LRB- Citizeness Truth -RRB- . Threatened by the new revolutionary government , she offered her wealth to the First French Republic before it could be confiscated .
In April 1793 , her nephew , the young duc de Chartres -LRB- future Louis-Philippe King of the French -RRB- , fled France and sought asylum with the Austrians . In retribution , the National Convention decreed the imprisonment of all Bourbons remaining in France . While other members of the OrlÃ ans family still in France were kept under house arrest , Bathilde , Philippe Ã galitÃ and his sons were imprisoned in the Fort Saint-Jean in Marseille . Badly rewarded for her fidelity to the democratic ideals of the Revolution , she survived a year and a half in a prison cell . In November of the same year , her brother was guillotined . Miraculously spared during the Reign of Terror , Bathilde was liberated during the Thermidorian Reaction and returned to her Ã lysÃ e residence in Paris . Poverty-stricken , she was forced to rent out most of the palace .
In 1797 , the Directoire decided to exile the last of the Bourbons still living in France . With her sister-in-law , Louise Marie AdÃ laÃ de de Bourbon , duchesse d'Orl Ã ans , Bathilde was made to get into an old coach with all her remaining worldly goods and was sent to Spain with her illegitimate daughter . Despite being forty-seven years old at the time , during the months which this journey took , she had an amorous intrigue with a handsome twenty-seven year old police officer -LRB- gendarme -RRB- under whose responsibility she had been put . The two maintained a correspondence during her exile .

Cyperus papyrus -LRB- papyrus sedge or paper reed -RRB- is a monocot belonging to the sedge family Cyperaceae . It is a herbaceous perennial native to Africa , and forms tall stands of reed-like swamp vegetation in shallow water .
Papyrus sedge -LRB- and its close relatives -RRB- has a very long history of use by humans , notably by the Ancient Egyptiansâ '' it is the source of papyrus paper , parts of it can be eaten , and the highly buoyant stems can be made into boats . It is now often cultivated as an ornamental plant .
Ali Amrozi bin Haji Nurhasyim -LRB- also known as Amrozi -RRB- -LRB- 5 July 1962 -- 9 November 2008 -RRB- was an Indonesian executed for his part in the 2002 Bali bombings .
Zilupe is a town of a few hundred inhabitants in Latvia , by the Zilupe River , on the border with Russia . Zilupe 's railway station is the final station for the Riga-Zilupe train route , which is one of the longest passenger rail routes in Latvia . The town first began to take shape during construction of the line in 1900 , the station taking the name Rozenova , after the former landowner .
Sun Yat-sen -LRB- ; 12 November 1866 -- 12 March 1925 -RRB- was a Chinese doctor , revolutionary and political leader . As the foremost pioneer of Nationalist China , Sun is frequently referred to as the Founding Father of Republican China , a view agreed upon by both the People 's Republic of China and the Republic of China -LRB- Taiwan -RRB- . Sun played an instrumental role in inspiring the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty , the last imperial dynasty of China . Sun was the first provisional president when the Republic of China -LRB- ROC -RRB- was founded in 1912 and later co-founded the Chinese National People 's Party or Kuomintang -LRB- KMT -RRB- where he served as its first leader . Sun was a uniting figure in post-Imperial China , and remains unique among 20th-century Chinese politicians for being widely revered amongst the people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait .
Although Sun is considered one of the greatest leaders of modern China , his political life was one of constant struggle and frequent exile . After the success of the revolution , he quickly fell out of power in the newly founded Republic of China , and led successive revolutionary governments as a challenge to the warlords who controlled much of the nation . Sun did not live to see his party consolidate its power over the country during the Northern Expedition . His party , which formed a fragile alliance with the Communists , split into two factions after his death . Sun 's chief legacy resides in his developing a political philosophy known as the Three Principles of the People : nationalism , democracy , and the people 's livelihood .
An ell -LRB- from Proto-Indo-European \* el - `` elbow , forearm '' -RRB- , is a unit of measurement , approximating the length of a man 's arm .
Several national forms existed , with different lengths , including the Scottish ell -LRB- approx . 37 i -RRB- , the Flemish ell -LRB- 27 i -RRB- , the French ell -LRB- 54 i -RRB- . the Polish ell -LRB- approx . 31 i -RRB- and the Danish ell -LRB- 25 i -RRB-
Select customs were observed by English importers of Dutch textiles : although all cloths were bought by the Flemish ell , linen was sold by the English ell , but tapestry was sold by the Flemish ell .
A chess tournament is a series of chess games played competitively to determine a winning individual or team . Since the first international chess tournament in London , 1851 , chess tournaments have become the standard form of chess competition among serious players .
Today , the most recognized chess tournaments for individual competition include the Linares chess tournament and the Corus chess tournament . The largest team chess tournament is the Chess Olympiad , in which players compete for their country 's team in the same fashion as the Olympic Games . Since the 1950s , chess computers have even begun entering the tournament scene .
The town is home to a prominent rugby union club , Biarritz Olympique .
An elf -LRB- plural elves -RRB- is a being of Germanic mythology . The elves were originally thought of as a race of divine or semi-divine beings -LRB- wights , vÃ ttir -RRB- endowed with magical powers , which they use both for the benefit and the injury of mankind . In medieval Norse mythology , they appear to have been divided into light elves and dark elves , difficult to delineate from the Ã sir -LRB- gods -RRB- on one hand and the dvergar -LRB- dwarves -RRB- on the other .
In early modern and modern folklore , they become associated with the fairies of Romance folklore and assume a diminutive size , often living mainly in forests but also underground in hills or rocks , or in wells and springs . 19th-century Romanticism attempted to restore them to full stature , often depicting them as very young , probably adolescent -LRB- lack of facial hair on male elves -RRB- , men and women of great beauty .
From their depiction in Romanticism , elves entered the 20th-century high fantasy genre in the wake of the published work of J. R. R. Tolkien -LRB- especially the posthumous publication of his Silmarillion where Tolkien 's treatment of the relation of light elves , dark elves and dwarves is made explicit -RRB- .

Some of the exhibits are only in their initial stages . The museum houses a large aviation library and photographic archives .
The Oregon Trail is a 2000 m historic east-west wagon route that connected various towns on the Missouri River to valleys in Oregon and locations in between . It was the oldest of the northern commercial and emigrant trails and was originally discovered and used by fur trappers and traders in the fur trade from about 1811 to 1840 . In its earliest days much of the future Oregon Trail was not passable to wagons but was passable everywhere only to men walking or riding horses and leading mule trains . By 1836 , when the first Oregon wagon trains were organized at Independence , Missouri , the trail had been improved so much that it was possible to take wagons to Fort Hall , Idaho . By 1843 a rough wagon trail had been cleared to The Dalles , Oregon , and by 1846 all the way around Mount Hood to the Willamette Valley in the state of Oregon . What became called the Oregon Trail was complete even as improved roads , `` cutouts '' , ferries and bridges made the trip faster and safer almost every year .
After the American Revolutionary War various trails were found and used to connect the states of the east via the passes across the mountains -LRB- in Pennsylvania and Virginia -RRB- into the sparsely settled Northwest Territories , and as time went on , further west into the territories of Iowa and Missouri . The newly developed riverboats and steamboats traversing up and down the Ohio , Mississippi and Missouri Rivers helped speed settlement and development in the American mid-west -- Ohio , Illinois , Indiana , Missouri , Iowa et al . . These riverboats allowed passengers and supplies to be delivered to `` jumping off points '' for the Oregon Trail on the Missouri River cheaply , quickly and easily . West of the Missouri River , the next lands initially available for settlement with reportedly lush and fertile lands , forests , rivers and other possible sources of development , were along the far western Pacific coastal maritime lands in the Oregon Territory . From the early migration waves until the mid-1850s , most of the territories through which the Oregon Trail passed were still open lands uninhabited by white settlers .
This territory in the early 19th century was subject to competing claims by the United States and Britain , who had come to an arrangement by 1818 that is usually described as `` joint occupancy '' . Britain 's name for the region was the Columbia District and the sparsely settled territory was governed by the local regional department of the British Hudson 's Bay Company . In about 1840 a change in men 's fashion that avoided using the felt from beaver pelts to make men 's hats essentially ruined nearly all the fur trade in North America . After 1843 , when 700-1000 U.S. settlers went to Oregon , Britain became much more amenable to a boundary compromise . The Oregon Treaty of 1846 settled the major boundary disputes with Britain and the U.S. , opening the territory to undisputed settlement .
The eastern part of the Oregon Trail spanned part of the future state of Kansas and nearly all of what are now the states of Nebraska and Wyoming . The western half of the trail spanned most of the future states of Idaho and Oregon . Different travelers started on the trail from several diverse -LRB- and changing -RRB- `` jumping off points '' in Missouri and later from locations in the Iowa and Nebraska Territories . The various branches of the eastern Oregon trail -LRB- s -RRB- merged somewhere along the lower Platte River Valley , near Fort Kearny , Nebraska Territory . Initially the Missouri river ports of Kansas City , Kansas\/Independence and St. Joseph , Missouri were the main Oregon Trail heads . Small steamboats carrying fur traders navigated the Missouri River up to the Yellowstone River as early as 1832 . Larger steamboats traveling much above St. Joseph were blocked until dredging opened a bigger channel in 1852 . After 1846 many Oregon travelers started nearer the confluence of the Platte and Missouri Rivers from Kanesville , Iowa -LRB- est . 1846 and renamed Council Bluffs , Iowa in 1852 -RRB- and Omaha , Nebraska -LRB- est . 1852 -RRB- . By 1847 the Mormons , who had temporarily settled in large numbers in Iowa and Nebraska Territory on the Missouri River after being driven out of Nauvoo , Illinois , had established three ferries across the Missouri River near Kanesville , and others built even more ferries .

A recognition signal is a signal where a person , a ship , an airplane or something else is recognized . They can be used during war or can be used to help the police recognize each other during undercover operations . It can also be used in biology to signal that a molecule or chemical is to be bound to another molecule .
These signals are often used to recognize friends and enemies in a war . For military use these signals often use colored lights or the International marine signal flags
Other uses of the signal include the police who sometimes use a recognition signal so that officers in uniform can recognize officers in normal clothing -LRB- undercover -RRB- . The NYPD often use headbands , wristbands or colored clothing as recognition signals which are known as the `` color of the day '' .
A recognition signal is also a chemical signal used in biology to signal the end of a section of DNA or RNA during gene duplication in cells .

Meccano is mentioned in the first chapter of Graham Greene 's novel The Power and the Glory . Monoclonius -LRB- meaning `` single sprout '' -RRB- was a ceratopsian dinosaur from the Judith River Formation of Late Cretaceous Montana and Canada . It is often confused with Centrosaurus , a similar genus of ceratopsian -LRB- some think the two may even be identical , of a different age or gender -RRB- . Monoclonius was described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1876 .
All Monoclonius specimens are now believed to be juveniles or subadults , in many cases of other genera such as Centrosaurus . Contrary to popular belief , the name Monoclonius does not mean `` single horn '' or refer to its distinctive single nasal horn . In fact , the genus was named before it was known to have been a horned dinosaur , and had previously been considered a `` hadrosaur . '' The name in fact means `` single sprout '' , in reference to the way its teeth grew compared to its relative Diclonius -LRB- `` double sprout '' -RRB- , which was named by Edward Drinker Cope in the same paper as Monoclonius .
In Diclonius , Cope interpreted the fossils to show two series of teeth in use at one time -LRB- one mature set and one sprouting replacement set -RRB- , while in Monoclonius , there appeared to be only one set of teeth in use as a chewing surface at any one time , with replacement teeth growing in only after mature teeth had fallen out . Monoclonius was Edward Drinker Cope 's third named ceratopsian -LRB- after Agathaumas and Polyonax -RRB- . The type specimen was found in the summer of 1876 in Montana , only about 100 miles from the site of the Battle of the Little Bighorn that June . Although it was not an articulated skeleton , Cope recovered most of the animal -LRB- only the feet were entirely missing -RRB- , including skull material and the base part of a long nasal horn .
Classical antiquity -LRB- also the classical era or classical period -RRB- is a broad term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea , comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient Greece and ancient Rome , collectively known as the Greco-Roman world . It is the period in which Greek and Roman literature -LRB- such as Aeschylus , Ovid , Homer and others -RRB- flourished .
It is conventionally taken to begin with the earliest-recorded Greek poetry of Homer -LRB- 8th â `` 7th century BC -RRB- , and continues through the rise of Christianity and the decline of the Roman Empire -LRB- 5th century AD -RRB- . It ends with the dissolution of classical culture at the close of Late Antiquity -LRB- AD 300 â `` 600 -RRB- , blending into the Early Middle Ages -LRB- AD 600 â `` 1000 -RRB- . Such a wide sampling of history and territory covers many disparate cultures and periods . `` Classical antiquity '' may refer also to an idealized vision among later people of what was , in Edgar Allan Poe 's words , `` the glory that was Greece , the grandeur that was Rome ! ''
The civilization of the ancient Greeks has been immensely influential on the language , politics , educational systems , philosophy , science , art and architecture of the modern world : From the surviving fragments of classical antiquity , a revival-movement was gradually formed from the 14th century onwards which came to be known later as the Renaissance in Western Europe , and again resurgent during various neo-classical revivals in the 18th and 19th centuries .
The earliest period of classical antiquity takes place before the background of gradual re-appearance of historical sources following the Bronze Age collapse . The 8th and 7th centuries BC are still largely proto-historical , with the earliest Greek alphabetic inscriptions appearing in the first half of the 8th century . Homer is usually assumed to have lived in the 8th or 7th century , and his lifetime is often taken as marking the beginning of classical antiquity . In the same period falls the traditional date for the establishment of the Ancient Olympic Games , in 776 BC .
The Phoenicians originally expanded from Levantine ports , by the 8th century dominating trade in the Mediterranean . Carthage was founded in 814 BC , and the Carthaginians by 700 BC had firmly established strongholds in Sicily , Italy and Sardinia , which brought about conflicts of interest with Etruria .
The Archaic period followed the Greek Dark Ages , and saw significant advancements in political theory , and the rise of democracy , philosophy , theater , poetry , as well as the revitalisation of the written language -LRB- which had been lost during the Dark Ages -RRB- . In pottery , the Archaic period sees the development of the Orientalizing style , which signals a shift from the Geometric Style of the later Dark Ages and the accumulation of influences derived from Phoenicia and Syria .
Pottery styles associated with the later part of the Archaic age are the black-figure pottery , which originated in Corinth during the 7th century BC and its successor , the red-figure style , developed by the Andokides Painter in about 530 BCE .
The Etruscans had established political control in the region by the late 7th century BC , forming the aristocratic and monarchial elite . The Etruscans apparently lost power in the area by the late 6th century BC , and at this point , the Italic tribes reinvented their government by creating a republic , with much greater restraints on the ability of rulers to exercise power .
According to legend , Rome was founded on April 21 , 753 BC by twin descendants of the Trojan prince Aeneas , Romulus and Remus . As the city was bereft of women , legend says that the Latins invited the Sabines to a festival and stole their unmarried maidens , leading to the integration of the Latins and the Sabines .
Archaeological evidence indeed shows first traces of settlement at the Roman Forum in the mid 8th century BC , though settlements on the Palatine Hill may date back to the 10th century BC .

Subtraction is one of the four basic arithmetic operations ; it is the inverse of addition , meaning that if we start with any number and add any number and then subtract the same number we added , we return to the number we started with . Subtraction is denoted by a minus sign in infix notation .
The traditional names for the parts of the formula c b = a are minuend -LRB- c -RRB- subtrahend -LRB- b -RRB- = difference -LRB- a -RRB- . The words `` minuend '' and `` subtrahend '' are uncommon in modern usage . Instead we say that c and b are terms , and treat subtraction as addition of the additive inverse . The answer is still called the difference .
The primary section of scripture cited for this position is Matthew 24:32 -35 ; where Jesus is quoted teaching the parable of the fig tree , which is proposed as the key that unlocks the understanding of the general timing of the rapture , as well as the surrounding prophecies listed in the sections of scripture that precede and follow this parable . The Edo period , or Tokugawa period , is a division of Japanese history which was ruled by the shoguns of the Tokugawa family , running from 1603 to 1868 .
The political entity of this period was the Tokugawa shogunate . The Tokugawa shogunate was officially established in Edo on 24 March 1603 by the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu .
The Tokugawa shogunate was overthrown by the Meiji Restoration on 3 May 1868 , the fall of Edo and the restoration of Tenno 's rule at the reign of fifteenth and last shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu . An evolution took place in the centuries from the time of the Kamakura shogunate , which co-existed in equilibrium with the Tenno 's court , to the Tokugawa , when the bushi became the unchallenged rulers in what historian Edwin O. Reischauer called a `` centralized feudal '' form of government . Instrumental in the rise of the new bakufu was Tokugawa Ieyasu , the main beneficiary of the achievements of Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi . Already powerful , Ieyasu profited by his transfer to the rich KantÅ area . He maintained 2.5 million koku of land , new headquarters at Edo , a strategically situated castle town -LRB- the future Tokyo -RRB- , and also had an additional two million koku of land and thirty-eight vassals under his control .
After Hideyoshi 's death , Ieyasu moved quickly to seize control from the Toyotomi family . Ieyasu 's victory over the western daimyo at the Battle of Sekigahara -LRB- October 21 , 1600 , or in the Japanese calendar on the 15th day of the ninth month of the fifth year of the KeichÅ era -RRB- gave him virtual control of all Japan . He rapidly abolished numerous enemy daimyo houses , reduced others , such as that of the Toyotomi , and redistributed the spoils of war to his family and allies . Ieyasu still failed to achieve complete control of the western daimyo , but his assumption of the title of shogun helped consolidate the alliance system . After further strengthening his power base , Ieyasu installed his son Hidetada -LRB- 1579 â `` 1632 -RRB- as shogun and himself as retired shogun in 1605 . The Toyotomi were still a significant threat , and Ieyasu devoted the next decade to their eradication .
In 1615 , the Toyotomi stronghold at Osaka was destroyed by the Tokugawa army . The Tokugawa -LRB- or Edo -RRB- period brought 250 years of stability to Japan . The political system evolved into what historians call bakuhan , a combination of the terms bakufu and han -LRB- domains -RRB- to describe the government and society of the period . In the bakuhan , the shogun had national authority and the daimyo had regional authority . This represented a new unity in the feudal structure , which featured an increasingly large bureaucracy to administer the mixture of centralized and decentralized authorities .
The Tokugawa became more powerful during their first century of rule : land redistribution gave them nearly seven million koku , control of the most important cities , and a land assessment system reaping great revenues . The feudal hierarchy was completed by the various classes of daimyo . Closest to the Tokugawa house were the shinpan , or `` related houses '' . They were twenty-three daimyo on the borders of Tokugawa lands , daimyo all directly related to Ieyasu . The shinpan held mostly honorary titles and advisory posts in the bakufu . The second class of the hierarchy were the fudai , or `` house daimyo '' , rewarded with lands close to the Tokugawa holdings for their faithful service . By the eighteenth century , 145 fudai controlled such smaller han , the greatest assessed at 250,000 koku . Members of the fudai class staffed most of the major bakufu offices . Ninety-seven han formed the third group , the tozama -LRB- outside vassals -RRB- , former opponents or new allies . The tozama were located mostly on the peripheries of the archipelago and collectively controlled nearly ten million koku of productive land .
Because the tozama were least trusted of the daimyo , they were the most cautiously managed and generously treated , although they were excluded from central government positions . The Tokugawa not only consolidated their control over a reunified Japan , they also had unprecedented power over the emperor , the court , all daimyo and the religious orders . The emperor was held up as the ultimate source of political sanction for the shogun , who ostensibly was the vassal of the imperial family . The Tokugawa helped the imperial family recapture its old glory by rebuilding its palaces and granting it new lands .
To ensure a close tie between the imperial clan and the Tokugawa family , Ieyasu 's granddaughter was made an imperial consort in 1619 . A code of laws was established to regulate the daimyo houses . The code encompassed private conduct , marriage , dress , types of weapons and numbers of troops allowed ; required feudal lords to reside in Edo every other year -LRB- the sankin kÅ tai system -RRB- ; prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships ; proscribed Christianity ; restricted castles to one per domain -LRB- han -RRB- and stipulated that bakufu regulations were the national law . Although the daimyo were not taxed per se , they were regularly levied for contributions for military and logistical support and for such public works projects as castles , roads , bridges and palaces . The various regulations and levies not only strengthened the Tokugawa but also depleted the wealth of the daimyo , thus weakening their threat to the central administration . The han , once military-centered domains , became mere local administrative units . The daimyo did have full administrative control over their territory and their complex systems of retainers , bureaucrats and commoners .
Karl Arnold -LRB- March 21 , 1901 -- June 29 , 1958 -RRB- was a German politician . He was Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia from 1947 to 1956 . He was the first President of the Bundesrat and as such formally head of state of the Federal Republic of Germany , before the election of President Theodor Heuss .
Arnold was born in HerrlishÃ fen in WÃ 1\/4 rttemberg . He was trained as shoemaker and later -LRB- 1920\/21 -RRB- studied at the Soziale Hochschule Leohaus , Munich .
From 1920 onwards , Arnold worked as functionary of the movement of Christian workers . In 1924 , he became secretary of the Christian workers union for the DÃ 1\/4 sseldorf region . He was elected in the town council of DÃ 1\/4 sseldorf for the Centre Party in 1929 .

In 1933 , Arnold was co-owner of a sanitary installation shop in DÃ 1\/4 sseldorf . The Gestapo observed and hunted him in the following years because of his political activities . In 1944 , he was jailed by the Gestapo .
After World War II , Arnold became politically active again . In 1945 , he was co-founder of the local Christian-Democratic Party in DÃ 1\/4 sseldorf , which became part of the CDU later in 1945 . Also in 1945 , the DÃ 1\/4 sseldorf chapter of the united workers union was founded , presided by Arnold . On January 29 , 1946 , Arnold was named mayor of DÃ 1\/4 sseldorf and later elected in the first free elections -LRB- October 26 , 1946 -RRB- .

Until 1950 he presided over a coalition of CDU , Centre Party , SPD and -LRB- shortly -RRB- the Communist Party . He considered himself a `` christian socialist '' . The only in-parliament-party he did not let enter the government was the FDP , whose North-Rhine Westphalian branch had a particular nationalist bent .
On September 7 , 1949 he was elected as the first president of the federal Bundesrat of Germany .
From 1950 to 1956 , Arnold was elected minister president for North Rhine-Westphalia twice again , governing with the help of conservative parties and the Free Democrats . Important acts of his government were the foundation of the North Rhine-Westphalian broadcasting system -LRB- today : Westdeutscher Rundfunk -RRB- and the German system of workers union influence in steel and coal industries .
On February 20 , 1956 , the FDP switched coalition affiliation to the SPD , ending the Arnold government in North Rhine-Westphalia .
In 1957 , he was elected into the German Bundestag -LRB- with a 72 % majority in his constituency -RRB- . He was member of the Bundestag until June 29 , 1958 , when he died of heart disfunction .

The argument from inconsistent revelations , also known as the avoiding the wrong hell problem , is an argument against the existence of God . It asserts that it is unlikely that God exists because many theologians and faithful adherents have produced conflicting and mutually exclusive revelations . Since a person not privy to revelation must either accept it or reject it based solely upon the authority of its proponent , and there is no way for a mere mortal to resolve these conflicting claims by investigation , it is prudent to reserve one 's judgment .
The argument is also used to demonstrate the difficulty of accepting the existence of any one God without personal revelation . Most arguments for the existence of God are not specific to any one religion and could be applied to many religions with near equal validity . Acceptance of any one religion thus requires a rejection of the others , and when faced with these competing claims in the absence of a personal revelation , it is difficult to decide amongst them . Were a personal revelation to be granted to a nonbeliever , the same problem of confusion would develop in each new person the believer shares the revelation with .
Woodward County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma . As of 2000 , the population was 18,486 . Its county seat is Woodward . Woodward County was originally known as `` N '' County and was composed of present day Woodward County and portions of Harper , Ellis , and Woods County . Before its division at statehood , Woodward County , then 60 miles square , was the westernmost county of the Cherokee Outlet and adjoined Texas and the Oklahoma Panhandle on the west and Kansas on the north . Political pressure applied by William H. Murray during Oklahoma 's Constitutional Convention resulted in the reduction of the size of Woodward County to its present boundaries . It is unknown exactly who the county -LRB- and the town -RRB- is named after , but the two leading candidates are Brinton W. Woodward , a Santa Fe railway director , or Richard Woodward , a buffalo hunter .

Hamilton -LRB- ; 2006 population 504,559 ; UA population 647,634 ; CMA population 692,911 -RRB- is a port city in the Canadian province of Ontario . Conceived by George Hamilton when he purchased the Durand farm shortly after the War of 1812 , Hamilton has become the center of a densely populated and industrialized region at the west end of Lake Ontario known as the Golden Horseshoe . On January 1 , 2001 , the new City of Hamilton was formed through the amalgamation of the former city and the other constituent lower-tier municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth with the upper-tier regional government . Residents of the old city are known as Hamiltonians . Since 1981 , the metropolitan area has been listed as the ninth largest in Canada and the third largest in Ontario .
Hamilton is home to the shared Royal Botanical Gardens , the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum , the Bruce Trail , McMaster University and Mohawk College . The Canadian Football Hall of Fame can be found downtown right beside Hamilton City Hall and across town to the east , the Canadian Football League 's Hamilton Tiger-Cats play at Ivor Wynne Stadium .
Partly because of its diverse environment , numerous TV and film productions have been filmed in Hamilton , regulated by the Hamilton Film and Television Office . A growing arts and culture sector garnered media attention in a 2006 Globe and Mail news article , entitled `` Go West , Young Artist , '' which focused on the growing art scene in Hamilton . The article highlighted local art galleries , recording studios and independent film production .
In pre-colonial times , the Neutral Indians used much of the land but were gradually driven out by the Five -LRB- later Six -RRB- Nations -LRB- Iroquois -RRB- who were allied with the British against the Huron and their French allies . A member of the Iroquois Confederacy provided the route and name for Mohawk Road , which originally included King street in the lower city . In 1784 , about 10,000 United Empire Loyalists settled in Upper Canada -LRB- what is now southern Ontario -RRB- , chiefly in Niagara , around the Bay of Quinte , and along the St. Lawrence River between Lake Ontario and Montreal . They were soon followed by many more Americans , some of them not so much ardent loyalists but attracted nonetheless by the availability of inexpensive , arable land . At the same time , large numbers of Iroquois loyal to Britain arrived from the United States and were settled on reserves west of Lake Ontario .
The town of Hamilton was conceived by George Hamilton -LRB- a son of a Queenston entrepreneur and founder , Robert Hamilton -RRB- , when he purchased farm holdings of James Durand , the local Member of the British Legislative Assembly , shortly after the War of 1812 . Nathaniel Hughson , a property owner to the north , cooperated with George Hamilton to prepare a proposal for a courthouse and jail on Hamilton 's property . Hamilton offered the land to the crown for the future site . Durand was empowered by Hughson and Hamilton to sell property holdings which later became the site of the town . As he had been instructed , Durand circulated the offers at York during a session of the Legislative Assembly and a new Gore District was established of which the Hamilton town site was a member .
Initially , this town was not the most important center of the Gore District . A permanent jail was not constructed until 1832 when a cut-stone design was completed on one of the two squares created in 1816 , Prince 's Square . Subsequently , the first police board and the town limits were defined by statute on February 13 , 1833 . Official City status was achieved on June 9 , 1846 , by an act of Parliament , 9 Victoria Chapter 73 .
As the city grew , several prominent buildings were constructed in the late 19th century , including the Grand Lodge of Canada in 1855 , West Flamboro Methodist Church in 1879 -LRB- later purchased by Dufferin Masonic Lodge in 1893 -RRB- , a public library in 1890 , and the Right House department store in 1893 . The first commercial telephone service in Canada , the first telephone exchange in the British Empire , and the second telephone exchange in all of North America all were established in the city between 1877 â `` 78 .
Though suffering through the Hamilton Street Railway strike of 1906 , with industrial businesses expanding , Hamilton 's population doubled between 1900 and 1914 . Two steel manufacturing companies , Stelco and Dofasco , were formed in 1910 and 1912 , respectively , and Procter & Gamble and the Beech-Nut Packing Company opened manufacturing plants in 1914 and 1922 , respectively , their first outside the US . Population and economic growth continued until the 1960s , with the 1929 construction of the city 's first high-rise building , the Pigott Building , the move of McMaster University from Toronto to Hamilton , the opening of the second Canadian Tire store in Canada in 1934 , an airport in 1940 , a Studebaker assembly line in 1948 , the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway in 1958 , and the first Tim Hortons store in 1964 . Since then , many of the large industries have moved or shut down operations and the economy has shifted more toward the service sector , such as transportation , education , and health services .
On January 1 , 2001 , the new city of Hamilton was formed from the forced amalgamation of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth and its six municipalities : Ancaster , Dundas , Flamborough , Glanbrook , and Stoney Creek . Before amalgamation , the `` old '' City of Hamilton had 331,121 Hamiltonians divided into 100 neighborhoods . The new amalgamated city has 490,268 people in over 100 old neighborhoods , and surrounding communities .
Hamilton is located in Southern Ontario on the western end of the Niagara Peninsula and wraps around the westernmost part of Lake Ontario ; most of the city , including the downtown section , is on the south shore . Hamilton is situated in the geographic center of the Golden Horseshoe and is roughly the midway point between Toronto and Buffalo , New York . Its major physical features are Hamilton Harbour , marking the northern limit of the city , and the Niagara Escarpment running through the middle of the city across its entire breadth , bisecting the city into ` upper ' and ` lower ' parts .
According to all records from local historians , this district was called `` Attiwandaronia '' by the native Neutral people . The first aboriginals to settle in the Hamilton area called the bay Macassa , meaning beautiful waters . Hamilton is one of 11 cities showcased in the book , `` Green City : People , Nature & Urban Places '' by Quebec author Mary Soderstrom , which examines the city as an example of an industrial powerhouse co-existing with nature . Soderstrom credits Thomas McQuesten and family in the 1930s who `` became champions of parks , greenspace and roads '' in Hamilton .
Burlington Bay is a natural harbor with a large sandbar called the Beachstrip . This sandbar was deposited during a period of higher lake levels during the last ice age , and extends southeast through the central lower city to the escarpment . Hamilton 's deep sea port is accessed by ship canal through the beach strip into the harbor and is traversed by two bridges , the QEW 's Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway and the lower Canal Lift Bridge .
Between 1788 and 1793 , the townships at the Head-of-the-Lake were surveyed and named . The area was first known as The Head-of-the-Lake for its location at the western end of Lake Ontario . John Ryckman , born in Barton township -LRB- where present day downtown Hamilton is -RRB- , described the area in 1803 as he remembered it : `` The city in 1803 was all forest . The shores of the bay were difficult to reach or see because they were hidden by a thick , almost impenetrable mass of trees and undergrowth ... Bears ate pigs , so settlers warred on bears . Wolves gobbled sheep and geese , so they hunted and trapped wolves . They also held organized raids on rattlesnakes on the mountainside . There was plenty of game . Many a time have I seen -LRB- sic -RRB- a deer jump the fence into my back yard , and there were millions of pigeons which we clubbed as they flew low . ''
George Hamilton , a settler and local politician , established a town site in the northern portion of Barton Township in 1815 . He kept several eastâ `` west roads which were originally Indian trails , but the northâ `` south streets were on a regular grid pattern . Streets were designated `` East '' or `` West '' if they crossed James Street or Highway 6 . Streets were designated `` North '' or `` South '' if they crossed King Street or Highway 8 . The overall design of the townsite , likely conceived in 1816 , was commonplace . George Hamilton employed a grid street pattern used in most towns in Upper Canada and throughout the American frontier . The eighty original lots had frontages of fifty feet ; each lot faced a broad street and backed onto a twelve foot lane . It took at least a decade for all of the original lots to be sold , but the construction of the Burlington Canal in 1823 , and a new court-house in 1827 , encouraged Hamilton to add more blocks around 1828 â `` 9 . At this time , he included a market square in an effort to draw commercial activity onto his lands , but the natural growth of the town was to the north of Hamilton 's plot .
The Hamilton Conservation Authority owns , leases or manages about 4500 h of land with the City operating 1077 h of parkland at 310 locations . Many of the parks are located along the Niagara Escarpment , which runs from Tobermory at the tip of the Bruce Peninsula in the north , to Queenston at the Niagara River in the south , and provides views of the cities and towns at the western end of Lake Ontario . The hiking path Bruce Trail runs the length of the escarpment . Hamilton is home to more than 100 waterfalls and cascades , most of which are on or near the Bruce Trail as it winds through the Niagara Escarpment .
Hamilton 's climate is humid-continental , characterized by changeable weather patterns . However , its climate is moderate compared with most of Canada . Hamilton 's location on an embayment at the southwestern corner of Lake Ontario with an escarpment dividing upper and lower parts of the city results in noticeable disparities in weather over short distances . With a July average of exactly 22.0 C , the lower city is located in a pocket of the Dfa climate zone found at the southwestern end of Lake Ontario -LRB- between Hamilton and Toronto and eastward into the Niagara Region -RRB- , while the upper reaches of the city fall into the Dfb climate zone .
The airport 's open , rural location and higher altitude -LRB- 240m vs. 85m ASL downtown -RRB- results in lower temperatures and higher snowfall amounts than the more sheltered and lower , built-up areas of the city . One exception is on early spring afternoons , when colder than air lake temperatures keep shoreline areas significantly cooler , under the presence of an east or north-east onshore flow .
According to the 2006 Canadian Census , more than 20 percent of the local population was not born in Canada . This is the third highest such proportion in Canada after Toronto at 49 % , and Vancouver at 39 % . Between 2001 and 2006 , the foreign-born population increased by 7.7 % while the total population of the Hamilton census metropolitan area -LRB- CMA -RRB- grew by 4.3 % . The share of Canada 's recent immigrants who settle in Hamilton has remained unchanged since 2001 at 1.9 % . Hamilton was home to 20,800 immigrants who arrived in Canada between 2001 and 2006 , half of whom were born in Asia and the Middle East , while nearly one-quarter -LRB- 23 % -RRB- were from Europe . Hamilton also had a high proportion of people with Italian , English , Scottish , German and Irish ancestry . Nearly three in ten residents reported English as their sole ethnic origin or as one of their ancestral origins .

Environics Analytics , a geodemographic marketing firm that created 66 different `` clusters '' of people complete with profiles of how they live , what they think and what they consume , sees a future Hamilton with younger upscale Hamiltoniansâ '' who are tech savvy and university educatedâ '' choosing to live in the downtown and surrounding areas rather than just visiting intermittently . More two and three storey townhouses and apartments will be built on downtown lots ; small condos will be built on vacant spaces in areas such as Dundas and Westdale to accommodate newly retired seniors ; and more retail and commercial zones will be created . The city is also expected to grow by more than 28,000 people and 18,000 households by the year 2012 .
The most important economic activity in Ontario is manufacturing , and the Torontoâ `` Hamilton region is the most highly industrialized section of the country . The area from Oshawa , Ontario around the west end of Lake Ontario to Niagara Falls , with Hamilton at its center , is known as the Golden Horseshoe and has a population of approximately 8.1 million people . The phrase was first used by Westinghouse President , Herbert H. Rogge , in a speech to the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce , on January 12 , 1954 . `` Hamilton in 50 years will be the forward cleat in a golden horseshoe of industrial development from Oshawa to the Niagara River ... 150 miles long and 50 m wide ... It will run from Niagara Falls on the south to about Oshawa on the north and take in numerous cities and towns already there , including Hamilton and Toronto . ''
With sixty percent of Canada 's steel being produced in Hamilton by Stelco and Dofasco , the city has become known as the Steel Capital of Canada . After nearly declaring bankruptcy , Stelco returned to profitability in 2004 and on August 26 , 2007 United States Steel Corporation acquired Stelco for C$ 38.50 in cash per share , owning more than 76 percent of Stelco 's outstanding shares . Dofasco , in 1999 , was the most profitable steel producer in North America and in 2000 , the most profitable in Canada . It currently has approximately 7,300 employees at its Hamilton plant and produces over four million tons of steel annually , representing about 30 % of Canada 's flat rolled sheet steel shipments . Dofasco is one of North America 's most profitable steel companies , and Dofasco was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index in 2006 for the seventh year in a row . Dofasco produces steel products for the automotive , construction , energy , manufacturing , pipe and tube , appliance , packaging and steel distribution industries . Dofasco is currently a stand alone subsidiary of Arcelor Mittal , the world 's largest steel producer . Previously ordered by the U.S. Department of Justice to divest itself of the Canadian company , Arcelor Mittal has now been allowed to retain Dofasco provided it sells several of its American assets instead .
Originally , in the 1940s , the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport was used as a wartime air force training station . Today TradePort International Corporation manages and operates the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport . Under TradePort management , passenger traffic at the Hamilton terminal has increased from 90,000 in 1996 to approximately 900,000 in 2002 . The airport 's mid-term target for growth in its passenger service is five million air travelers annually . The air cargo sector of the airport has 24-7 operational capability and strategic geographic location , allowing its capacity to increase by 50 % since 1996 ; 91,000 metric tonnes -LRB- 100,000 tons -RRB- of cargo passed through the airport in 2002 . Courier companies with operations at the airport include United Parcel Service and Cargojet Canada . In 2003 , the city began developing a 30-year growth management strategy which called , in part , for a massive aerotropolis industrial park centred around Hamilton Airport . The aerotropolis proposal , now known as the Airport Employment Growth District , is touted as a solution to the city 's shortage of employment lands . Hamilton turned over operation of the airport to TradePort International Corp. in 1996 . In 2007 , YVR Airport Services -LRB- YVRAS -RRB- , which runs the Vancouver International Airport , took over 100 per cent ownership of TradePort in a $ 13-million deal . The airport is also home to the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum .
A report by Hemson Consulting identified an opportunity to develop 1000 h of greenfields -LRB- the size of the Royal Botanical Gardens -RRB- that could generate an estimated 90,000 jobs by 2031 . A proposed aerotropolis industrial park at Highway 6 and 403 , has been debated at City Hall for years . Opponents feel the city needs to do more investigation about the cost to taxpayers before embarking on the project .

Pediococcus is a genus of Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria , placed within the family of Lactobacillaceae . They usually occur in pairs or tetrads , and divide along two planes of symmetry , as do the other lactic acid cocci genera Aerococci and Tetragenococcus . They are purely homofermentative . Pediococcus dextrinicus has recently been reassigned to the genus Lactobacillus .
Pediococcus is , along with other lactic acid bacteria such as Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus responsible for the fermentation of cabbage , making it Sauerkraut . In this process the sugars in fresh cabbage are transformed to lactic acids which give it a sour flavor and good keeping qualities . Pediococcus bacteria are usually considered contaminants of beer and wine although their presence is sometimes desired in beer styles such as Lambic . Certain Pediococcus isolates produce diacetyl which gives a buttery or butterscotch aroma to some wines -LRB- such as Chardonnay -RRB- and a few styles of beer . Pediococcus species are often used in silage inoculants . Pediococci are used as probiotics , and are commonly added as beneficial microbes in the creation of cheeses and yogurts .
Shakargarh , the headquarters of Shakargarh Tehsil , is a city in the north-east of Narowal District , Punjab , Pakistan . The city is located at 32 Â 16 ' 0N 75 Â 10 ' 0E and is situated at the west bank of the Ravi River .
The total area of Shakargarh is approximately 1,272 square kilometres . According to the 1998 census , Narowal District 's population was 1,256,097 of which only 12.11 % were urban It is an agricultural city , wheat , and rice being its main crops . The literacy rate in Shakargarh is 100 % and well known for the highest literacy rate of all Pakistan tehsils .
Before the independence of Pakistan , Shakargarh was the headquarters of Shakargarh Tehsil , which formed part of Gurdaspur district -LRB- now in India -RRB- . Under the Radcliffe Award , Shakargarh tehsil was transferred to Pakistan and attached with Sialkot District . However with the creation of Narowal District on 1 July 1991 , Shakargarh became tehsil headquarters was included as one of its tehsils . Shakargarh was the gateway of Mughals entering Gordaspur and going to Delhi . Shakargarh is also was the gateway to Kashmir and regarded as the rest point for travellers .

The sexual revolution -LRB- also known broadly as a time of `` sexual liberation '' -RRB- is a social outlook that challenges traditional codes of behavior related to sexuality and interpersonal relationships . The phenomenon took place throughout the Western world from the 1960s into the 1970s . Many of the changes in outlook developed into new codes of sexual behavior , many of which have become mainstream .
Sexual liberation included increased acceptance of sex outside of traditional heterosexual , monogamous relationships -LRB- primarily marriage -RRB- . Contraception and the pill , public nudity , the normalization of homosexuality and alternative forms of sexuality , and the legalization of abortion all followed .
The term -LRB- ` Sexual Revolution ' -RRB- has been used at least since the late 1910s and is often attributed as being influenced by Freud 's writing on sexual liberation and psychosexual issues .
Modern art includes artistic works produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s , and denotes the style and philosophy of the art produced during that era . The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation . Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art . A tendency toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art . More recent artistic production is often called Contemporary art or Postmodern art .
Modern art begins with the heritage of painters like Vincent van Gogh , Paul CÃ zanne , Paul Gauguin , Georges Seurat and Henri de Toulouse Lautrec all of whom were essential for the development of modern art . At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque , AndrÃ Derain , Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with `` wild '' , multi-colored , expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism . Henri Matisse 's two versions of The Dance signified a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting . It reflected Matisse 's incipient fascination with primitive art : the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism .
Initially influenced by Toulouse Lautrec , Gauguin and other late 19th century innovators Pablo Picasso made his first cubist paintings based on CÃ zanne 's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids : cube , sphere and cone . With the painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon -LRB- 1907 -RRB- , Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes , violently painted women , reminiscent of African tribal masks and his own new Cubist inventions . Analytic cubism was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque , exemplified by Violin and Candlestick , Paris , from about 1908 through 1912 . Analytic cubism , the first clear manifestation of cubism , was followed by Synthetic cubism , practiced by Braque , Picasso , Fernand LÃ ger , Juan Gris , Albert Gleizes , Marcel Duchamp and several other artists into the 1920s . Synthetic cubism is characterized by the introduction of different textures , surfaces , collage elements , papier collÃ and a large variety of merged subject matter .
The notion of modern art is closely related to Modernism .
Although modern sculpture and architecture are reckoned to have emerged at the end of the 19th century , the beginnings of modern painting can be located earlier . The date perhaps most commonly identified as marking the birth of modern art is 1863 , the year that Ã douard Manet exhibited his painting Le dÃ jeuner sur l'herbe in the Salon des RefusÃ s in Paris . Earlier dates have also been proposed , among them 1855 -LRB- the year Gustave Courbet exhibited The Artist 's Studio -RRB- and 1784 -LRB- the year Jacques-Louis David completed his painting The Oath of the Horatii -RRB- . In the words of art historian H. Harvard Arnason : `` Each of these dates has significance for the development of modern art , but none categorically marks a completely new beginning ... A gradual metamorphosis took place in the course of a hundred years . ''
The strands of thought that eventually led to modern art can be traced back to the Enlightenment , and even to the 17th century . The important modern art critic Clement Greenberg , for instance , called Immanuel Kant `` the first real Modernist '' but also drew a distinction : `` The Enlightenment criticized from the outside ... . Modernism criticizes from the inside . '' The French Revolution of 1789 uprooted assumptions and institutions that had for centuries been accepted with little question and accustomed the public to vigorous political and social debate . This gave rise to what art historian Ernst Gombrich called a `` self-consciousness that made people select the style of their building as one selects the pattern of a wallpaper . ''
The pioneers of modern art were Romantics , Realists and Impressionists . By the late 19th century , additional movements which were to be influential in modern art had begun to emerge : post-Impressionism as well as Symbolism .
Influences upon these movements were varied : from exposure to Eastern decorative arts , particularly Japanese printmaking , to the coloristic innovations of Turner and Delacroix , to a search for more realism in the depiction of common life , as found in the work of painters such as Jean-Fran Ã ois Millet . The advocates of realism stood against the idealism of the tradition-bound academic art that enjoyed public and official favor . The most successful painters of the day worked either through commissions or through large public exhibitions of their own work . There were official , government-sponsored painters ' unions , while governments regularly held public exhibitions of new fine and decorative arts .
The Impressionists argued that people do not see objects but only the light which they reflect , and therefore painters should paint in natural light -LRB- en plein air -RRB- rather than in studios and should capture the effects of light in their work . Impressionist artists formed a group , SociÃ tÃ Anonyme CoopÃ rative des Artistes Peintres , Sculpteurs , Graveurs -LRB- `` Association of Painters , Sculptors , and Engravers '' -RRB- which , despite internal tensions , mounted a series of independent exhibitions . The style was adopted by artists in different nations , in preference to a `` national '' style . These factors established the view that it was a `` movement '' . These traitsâ '' establishment of a working method integral to the art , establishment of a movement or visible active core of support , and international adoptionâ '' would be repeated by artistic movements in the Modern period in art .

It consists of the Chancellor and the cabinet ministers .
The fundamentals of the cabinet 's organization are set down in articles 62 to 69 of the Basic Law . The Chancellor is elected by the federal parliament -LRB- Bundestag -RRB- after being proposed by the President . Following the election , the Chancellor is appointed by the President . The ministers are appointed -LRB- and dismissed -RRB- by the President upon proposal of the Chancellor .
Eventually , before taking office , the Chancellor and ministers swear an oath in front of the parliament . The Chancellor is responsible for guiding the cabinet and deciding its political direction . According to the principle of departmentalization -LRB- Ressortprinzip -RRB- , the cabinet ministers are free to carry out their duties independently within the boundaries set by the Chancellor 's political directives . The Chancellor also decides the scope of each minister 's duties .
If two ministers disagree on a particular point , the cabinet resolves the conflict by a majority vote -LRB- Kollegialprinzip or principle of deference -RRB- . The Chancellor is in charge of the government 's administrative affairs , which are usually delegated to the head of the Chancellery . Details are laid down in the government 's rules for internal procedures -LRB- GeschÃ ftsordnung -RRB- . These state , e.g. , that the cabinet is quorate only if at least half of the ministers including the chair are present .

Twitter is a website owned and operated by Twitter Inc. which offers a social networking and microblogging service , enabling its users to send and read messages called tweets . Tweets are text-based posts composed of up to 140 characters displayed on the user 's profile page . Tweets are publicly visible by default ; however , senders can restrict message delivery to just their followers . Users may subscribe to other users ' tweets â `` this is known as following and subscribers are known as followers or tweeps -LRB- Twitter + peeps -RRB- .
All users can send and receive tweets via the Twitter website , compatible external applications -LRB- such as for smartphones -RRB- , or by Short Message Service -LRB- SMS -RRB- available in certain countries . While the service is free , accessing it through SMS may incur phone service provider fees . The website is based in San Francisco , California . Twitter also has servers and offices in San Antonio , Texas ; and Boston , Massachusetts . Twitter , Inc. was originally incorporated in California , but as of 2007 is incorporated in the jurisdiction of Delaware .
Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey and launched in July . Since then Twitter has gained popularity worldwide and is estimated to have 200 million users , generating 65 million tweets a day and handling over 800,000 search queries per day . It is sometimes described as the `` SMS of the Internet '' .
Twitter 's origins lie in a `` daylong brainstorming session '' that was held by board members of the podcasting company Odeo . While sitting in a park on a children 's slide and eating Mexican food , Dorsey introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group . The original project code name for the service was twttr , inspired by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes . The developers initially considered `` 10958 '' as a short code , but later changed it to `` 40404 '' for `` ease of use and memorability '' . Work on the project started on March 21 , 2006 , when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 9:50 PM Pacific Standard Time -LRB- PST -RRB- : `` just setting up my twttr '' .
'' -LRB- W -RRB- e came across the word ` twitter ' , and it was just perfect . The definition was ' a short burst of inconsequential information , ' and ` chirps from birds ' . And that 's exactly what the product was . '' - Jack Dorsey
The first Twitter prototype was used as an internal service for Odeo employees and the full version was introduced publicly on July 15 , 2006 . In October 2006 , Biz Stone , Evan Williams , Dorsey , and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo and all of its assets-including Odeo.com and Twitter.com-from the investors and shareholders . Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007 .
The tipping point for Twitter 's popularity was the 2007 South by Southwest -LRB- SXSW -RRB- festival . During the event , Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000 . `` The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways , exclusively streaming Twitter messages , '' remarked Newsweeks Steven Levy . `` Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters . Panelists and speakers mentioned the service , and the bloggers in attendance touted it . ''
Reaction at the festival was highly positive . Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter `` absolutely rul -LRB- ed -RRB- '' SXSW . Social software researcher Danah Boyd said Twitter `` own -LRB- ed -RRB- '' the festival . Twitter staff received the festival 's Web Award prize with the remark `` we 'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less . And we just did ! ''

According to The New York Times , `` Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Costolo forged a close relationship '' when Williams was away . According to PC Magazine , Williams was `` no longer involved in the day-to-day goings on at the company '' . He is focused on developing a new startup , but he became a member of Twitter 's board of directors , and promised to `` help in any way I can '' . Stone is still with Twitter but is working with AOL as an `` advisor on volunteer efforts and philanthropy '' . Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011 , as executive chairman and head of product development . Dorsey 's time is split with Square where he is CEO , and whose offices are within walking distance of Twitter 's in San Francisco .

Scissors are hand-operated cutting instruments . They consist of a pair of metal blades pivoted so that the sharpened edges slide against each other when the handles -LRB- bows -RRB- opposite to the pivot are closed . Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials , such as paper , cardboard , metal foil , thin plastic , cloth , rope and wire . Scissors can also be used to cut hair and food . Scissors and shears are functionally equivalent , but larger implements tend to be called shears .
There are many types of scissors and shears for different purposes . For example , children 's scissors , used only on paper , have dull blades and rounded corners to ensure safety . Scissors used to cut hair or fabric must be much sharper . The largest shears used to cut metal or to trim shrubs must have very strong , sharp blades .
Specialized scissors include sewing scissors , which often have one sharp point and one blunt point for intricate cutting of fabric , and nail scissors , which sometimes have curved blades for cutting fingernails and toenails .

Kota Kinabalu -LRB- pronounced , formerly Jesselton , is the capital of Sabah state in Malaysia . It is also the capital of the West Coast Division of Sabah . The city is located on the northwest coast of Borneo facing the South China Sea . The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park lies on one side and Mount Kinabalu , which gave the city its name , is nearby . Kota Kinabalu proper has a population of 617,972 while the larger urban area has an estimated population of 900,000 . It is the largest urban center in Sabah and the sixth largest in Malaysia .
Kota Kinabalu is often known as K.K. within Malaysia and internationally . It is a major tourist destination and a popular gateway for travellers visiting Sabah and Borneo . Kinabalu National Park is located about 90 kilometres from the city and there are many tourist attractions in and around the city . Kota Kinabalu is also one of the major industrial and commercial centres of East Malaysia . These two factors combine to make Kota Kinabalu one of the fastest growing cities in Malaysia .
In the late 1800s , the British North Borneo Company -LRB- BNBC -RRB- began to establish colonies throughout North Borneo -LRB- now Sabah -RRB- . In 1882 , the Company founded a small settlement in the area known as Gaya Bay which was already inhabited by the Bajau people . The first settlement was on Gaya Island -LRB- Pulau Gaya -RRB- . In 1897 , this first settlement was burned and destroyed by the indigenous Bajau freedom fighter led by Mat Salleh .
After the rebellion , the Company decided to relocate the settlement to the more easily defended mainland opposite Pulau Gaya . A nearby fishing village named Api-Api -LRB- see Original names below -RRB- , was the next settlement of the Company . This new location was then designated as the main harbor and port , as well as the terminus for the North Borneo Railway . It was expanded and renamed Jesselton , named after Sir Charles Jessel , the then Vice Chairman of the Company .
Eventually , Jesselton became a major trading post of North Borneo , dealing in rubber , rattan , honey , and wax . The new railway was used to transport goods to Jesselton harbor . The Malay and Bajau uprisings during these times were not uncommon , and the Company worked to quell the long-standing threat of piracy in the region .
Jesselton was razed by the retreating British early in World War II to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Japanese . After the Japanese takeover of Borneo , it was again renamed Api . Several rebellions against the Japanese military administration took place in Api . One major rebellion occurred in 1943 by the group called Kinabalu Guerrillas , consisting of local inhabitants . Japanese forces quelled the rebellion after its leader , Albert Kwok , was arrested and executed in 1944 . At the later stages of the war , what remained of the town was destroyed again by Allied bombings as part of the Borneo Campaign in 1945 , leaving only three buildings standing . The war in North Borneo ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on September 10 , 1945 .
After the war , the British North Borneo Company returned to administer Jesselton but was unable to finance the huge costs of reconstruction . They gave control of North Borneo to the British Crown in 1946 . The new colonial government elected to rebuild Jesselton as the capital of North Borneo instead of Sandakan , which had also been destroyed by the war .
When North Borneo together with Sarawak , Singapore & Federation of Malaya formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 , the state became known as Sabah and Jesselton remained its capital . Jesselton was renamed Kota Kinabalu on September 30 , 1968 and received official city status from the Malaysian government on February 2 , 2000 .
Kota Kinabalu is named after Mount Kinabalu , situated about 50 kilometres east-northeast of the city . Kinabalu derived from the name Aki Nabalu meaning the `` revered place of the dead '' , in which , Aki means `` ancestors '' or `` grandfather '' , and Nabalu being a name for the mountain in the Dusun language . There is also a source claiming that the term originated from Ki Nabalu , where Ki meaning `` have '' or `` exist '' , and Nabalu meaning `` spirit of the dead '' .
Kota is a Malay word for a `` fort '' , `` town '' , or a `` city '' . It is also used formally in a few other Malaysian towns and cities , for example , Kota Bahru , Kota Tinggi , and Kota Kemuning . It could also be used informally to refer to any towns or cities . Henceforth , a direct translation of the name Kota Kinabalu into English would be `` City of Kinabalu '' or `` Kinabalu City '' .
Wendy Suart wrote in her book on North Borneo , The Lingering Eye , `` there is in the -LRB- Sabah -RRB- State Museum a Dutch map of Borneo and the Celebes dated 1657 in which the settlement where Jesselton was to stand is clearly labeled Api Api . It may have some connection with the seaside tree with breathing roots that bears the same name . '' Another explanation is that the name Api Api is derived from the devastating fire which occurred in the city 's early years -LRB- ` Api ' means ` fire ' in the Malay language -RRB- . In Chinese , the city is known as ` Api ' , which is the Hakka pronunciation for ä å -LRB- ` Ya bi ' in Mandarin Chinese -RRB- .
Besides Jesselton , there has been a number of other claims as to the original name for Kota Kinabalu . The most popular , as mentioned above , is Api-Api , or sometimes simply Api , which is a Malay word meaning ` Fire ' . It was apparently named as such by the mainly Bajau locals to denote the blazing of the British administrative office in Pulau Gaya instigated by Mat Salleh , as well as other blazing incidents normally perpetrated by pirates . There were claims however that it was actually named after a nearby river called Sungai Api-Api . Besides Api-Api , another suggested historical name was Deasoka , which roughly means `` below the coconut tree '' in the Bajau language . The Bajau locals purportedly used this name to refer to a village on the southern part of the city which was filled with coconut trees . Another name was Singgah Mata which literally mean `` transit eye '' , but can be loosely translated as meaning `` pleasing to the eye '' . It is a name purportedly given by fishermen from Pulau Gaya referring to the strip of land of what is today Kota Kinabalu city center . Today , all these names have been immortalised into names of streets or buildings around the city . Some examples are : Lintasan Deasoka , Api-Api Centre , Jalan Singgah Mata , and Jesselton Point .
Being the capital city of Sabah , Kota Kinabalu plays an important role in the political and economic welfare of the population in the entire state . It is the seat of the state government where almost all of their ministries and agencies are based . Most of the Malaysian federal government agencies and departments are also located in Kota Kinabalu . The Sabah State Legislative Assembly is located at nearby Likas Bay . There are four Members of Parliament -LRB- MPs -RRB- representing four parliamentary constituencies in the city : Sepanggar -LRB- P. 171 -RRB- , Kota Kinabalu -LRB- P. 172 -RRB- , Putatan -LRB- P. 173 -RRB- , and Penampang -LRB- P. 174 -RRB- . The city also elects 9 representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Karambunai , Inanam , Likas , Api-Api , Luyang , Tanjung Aru , Petagas , Kepayan , and Moyog .
The city is administered by Dewan Bandaraya Kota Kinabalu -LRB- Kota Kinabalu City Hall -RRB- . The current mayor of Kota Kinabalu is Datuk Illiyas Ibrahim . He became the second mayor of the city after taking over the post from Datuk Abdul Ghani Rashid in 2006 . The city obtained city status on February 2 , 2000 , and prior to this it was administered by Majlis Perbandaran Kota Kinabalu -LRB- Kota Kinabalu Municipal Council -RRB- .
The city is defined within the borders of what is the district , formerly the municipality , of Kota Kinabalu . With an area of 351 square kilometres , it is the smallest but the most populous district in Sabah . It encompasses Tanjung Aru and Kepayan in the south , up to Telipok and Sepanggar in the north . The urban expanse of the city however extends into the district of Penampang on the south of the city border , which includes the towns of Donggongon and Putatan . The combined area of Kota Kinabalu -LRB- district -RRB- and the built up areas in Penampang can also be described as Kota Kinabalu -LRB- urban area -RRB- . The district of Penampang has an area of 466 square kilometres , and is administered by Majlis Daerah Penampang -LRB- Penampang District Council -RRB- .
On one end of the scale , Kota Kinabalu may sometimes only refer to , especially by local inhabitants , the city center or central business district , area near the sea facing Pulau Gaya . On the other end of the scale , it may also refer to the metropolitan area which includes urban Kota Kinabalu , and the surrounding towns of Papar and Kinarut , in the south , and Tuaran and Tamparuli , in the north , being within its zone of influence .
Kota Kinabalu currently has four sister cities .
Kota Kinabalu is located on the west coast of Sabah . The city lies on a narrow flatland between the Crocker Range to the east and the South China Sea to the west . There are six islands off the coast of the city . The largest is Pulau Gaya , the site of the first British settlement . Approximately 8,000 people live there . The smaller islands , mainly uninhabited , are named Pulau Sapi , Pulau Manukan , Pulau Sulug , Pulau Mamutik and Pulau Sepanggar to the north . Sepanggar island is located north of the National Park opposite Sepanggar Bay .
Flat land is at a premium in the city center , and there is a strict limit to the height of buildings : the airport is 7 km away , and the city is directly in the flight path . Most of the Central Business District -LRB- CBD -RRB- today is built on land reclaimed from the sea . The original local plant life has largely disappeared , but several hills within the city -LRB- too steep for building -RRB- are still clothed with tropical rainforest . One of these is Signal Hill , which confines the CBD to the shore . In the area of Likas Bay the remnants of an extensive mangrove forest was nearly lost . In 1996 , a perceptive state government stepped in and declared 24 a of the forest as a protected area . This forest is now known as the Kota Kinabalu City Bird Sanctuary . The sanctuary was given additional protection as a State Cultural Heritage Site in 1998 .
Gyeongju is a coastal city in the far southeastern corner of North Gyeongsang province in South Korea . It is the second largest city by area in the province after Andong , covering 1324 k with a population of 269,343 people according to the 2008 census . Gyeongju is 370 k southeast of Seoul , and 55 k east of the provincial capital , Daegu . The city borders Cheongdo and Yeongcheon to the west , Ulsan to the south and Pohang to the north , while to the east lies the coast of the Sea of Japan -LRB- East Sea -RRB- . Numerous low mountainsâ '' outliers of the Taebaek rangeâ '' are scattered around the city .
Gyeongju was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla -LRB- 57 BC â `` 935 AD -RRB- which ruled most of the Korean Peninsula between the 7th and 9th centuries . A vast number of archaeological sites and cultural properties from this period remain in the city . Gyeongju is often referred to as `` the museum without walls '' . Among such historical treasures , Seokguram grotto , Bulguksa temple , Gyeongju Historic Areas and Yangdong Folk Village are designated as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO . The many major historical sites have helped Gyeongju become one of the most popular tourist destinations in South Korea .
The city of Gyeongju was united with the nearby rural Gyeongju County in 1995 and is now an urbanâ `` rural complex . It is similar to 53 other small - and medium-sized cities with a population under 300,000 people in South Korea . As well as its rich historical heritage , Gyeongju today is affected by the economic , demographic , and social trends that have shaped modern South Korean culture . Tourism remains the major economic driver , but manufacturing activities have developed due to its proximity to major industrial centers such as Ulsan and Pohang . Gyeongju is connected to the nationwide rail and highway networks , which facilitate industrial and tourist traffic .

Yoshi 's Island DS is a platforming video game developed by Artoon for the Nintendo DS . Published by Nintendo , it was released in North America and Australasia in November 2006 , in Europe in December 2006 , and in Japan in March 2007 . It is the sequel to the 1995 SNES game , Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi 's Island . Announced at Nintendo 's E3 press conference in May 2006 , the game was well received by critics , scoring an average of 83 % on Metacritic 's aggregate . The game was originally going to be titled Yoshi 's Island 2 ; its name was changed two weeks before its U.S. release .
The game 's story focuses on the Yoshi clan as they attempt to rescue newborn children that have been kidnapped by Kamek . Yoshi 's Island DS uses the updated graphical style from Yoshi Touch & Go but retains the same core gameplay as its Super Nintendo Entertainment System predecessor , but whereas the SNES game featured only Baby Mario , DS introduces Baby Peach , Baby DK and Baby Wario and lets the player control Baby Bowser -LRB- who was a boss in SMW2 -RRB- , who each give Yoshi a different ability . The aim of the game is to use these abilities to progress through various themed worlds .
Yoshi 's Island DSs gameplay is the same as the previous game , with some additions . The player guides various different colored Yoshis through side scrolling stages . Yoshi can jump and hover -LRB- flutter jump -RRB- for a short time , eat enemies and turn them into eggs -LRB- which can be used for things like hitting switches and defeating distant enemies -RRB- and pound the ground -LRB- to smash crates , for example -RRB- . Some stages offer Yoshi the ability to morph into vehicles for a short time . DS , like the original Yoshi 's Island , differs from many platforming games in that Yoshi does not have a life bar ; when Yoshi is hit , the baby he is carrying falls off his back and Yoshi must retrieve him\/her before a timer runs out . -LRB- Unless yoshi falls on something that kills him instantly , such as a lava pit or spike field -RRB-
DS differs from the previous game in that five babies are available for Yoshi to carry , each bestowing a different ability . Baby Mario allows Yoshi to dash and makes special 'M ' blocks appear . He can also grab Super Stars to become Super Baby Mario . Baby Peach allows Yoshi to float and fly on wind currents ; Baby DK can grab and swing on vines and ropes ; Baby Wario uses his magnet to attract metal objects ; and Baby Bowser spits fireballs , but the Yoshi carrying him can not make eggs . The need to switch babies at key points adds a puzzle element to the game .

The American Dream is a national ethos of the United States in which freedom includes a promise of the possibility of prosperity and success . In the definition of the American Dream by James Truslow Adams in 1931 , `` life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone , with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement '' regardless of social class or circumstances of birth . The idea of the American Dream is rooted in the United States Declaration of Independence which proclaims that `` all men are created equal '' and that they are `` endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights '' including `` Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness . ''
Since its founding in 1776 , the United States has regarded and promoted itself as an Empire of Liberty and prosperity . The meaning of the `` American Dream '' has changed over the course of history . Historically the Dream originated in the New World mystique regarding especially the availability of low-cost land for farm ownership . As the Royal governor of Virginia noted in 1774 , the Americans , `` for ever imagine the Lands further off are still better than those upon which they are already settled . '' He added that if they attained Paradise , they would move on if they heard of a better place farther west .
The ethos today simply indicates the ability , through participation in the society and economy , for everyone to achieve prosperity . According to the dream , this includes the opportunity for one 's children to grow up and receive a good education and career without artificial barriers . It is the opportunity to make individual choices without the prior restrictions that limit people according to their class , caste , religion , race , or ethnicity . Immigrants to the United States sponsored ethnic newspapers in their own language ; the editors typically promoted the American Dream .
In the 19th century the most articulate immigrants to the United States were the well-educated refugees who fled the failed revolution in Germany in 1848 . They often compared the two countries , laying great stress on the political freedoms in the New World , and the lack of a hierarchical or aristocratic society that determined the ceiling for individual aspirations . One of them explained : â The German emigrant comes into a country free from the despotism , privileged orders and monopolies , intolerable taxes , and constraints in matters of belief and conscience . Everyone can travel and settle wherever he pleases . No passport is demanded , no police mingles in his affairs or hinders his movements ... Fidelity and merit are the only sources of honor here . The rich stand on the same footing as the poor ; the scholar is not a mug above the most humble mechanics ; no German ought to be ashamed to pursue any occupation ... -LRB- In America -RRB- wealth and possession of real estate confer not the least political right on its owner above what the poorest citizen has . Nor are there nobility , privileged orders , or standing armies to weaken the physical and moral power of the people , nor are there swarms of public functionaries to devour in idleness credit for . Above all , there are no princes and corrupt courts representing the so-called divine ` right of birth . ' In such a country the talents , energy and perseverance of a person ... have far greater opportunity to display than in monarchies . ''

The Brigantes were a Celtic tribe who in pre-Roman times controlled the largest section of what would become Northern England , and a significant part of the Midlands . Their kingdom is sometimes called Brigantia , and it was centred in what was later known as Yorkshire . Ptolemy lists the Brigantes also as a tribe in Ireland , where they could be found around Wexford , Kilkenny and Waterford while another probably Celtic tribe named Brigantii is mentioned by Strabo as a sub-tribe of the Vindelici in the region of the Alps .
Within Great Britain , the territory which the Brigantes inhabited was bordered by that of four other Celtic tribes : the Carvetii -LRB- to whom they may have been related -RRB- in the North-West , the Parisii to the East and , to the South , the Corieltauvi and the Cornovii . To the North was the territory of the Votadini , which straddled the present day border between England and Scotland .
The name Brigantes -LRB- Î ' Ï Î Î Î Î 1\/2 Ï Î Ï -RRB- is cognate to that of the goddess Brigantia . The name is from a root meaning `` high , elevated '' , and it is unclear whether settlements called Brigantium were so named as `` high ones '' in a metaphorical sense of nobility , or literally as `` highlanders '' , referring to the Pennines , or inhabitants of physically elevated fortifications . -LRB- IEW , s.v. `` bhereg ` h - '' -RRB- .
Sulfur dichloride is the chemical compound with the formula SCl2 . This cherry-red liquid is the simplest sulfur chloride and one of the most common . It is used as a precursor to organosulfur compounds .
SCl2 is produced by the chlorination of either elemental sulfur or disulfur dichloride . The process occurs in a series of steps , some of which are : : S8 + 4 Cl2 â ' 4 S2Cl2 ; Î '' H = â ' 58.2 kJ\/mol : S2Cl2 + Cl2 â ' 2 SCl2 ; Î '' H = â ' 40.6 kJ\/mol The addition of Cl2 to S2Cl2 has been proposed to proceed via a mixed valence intermediate Cl3S-SCl . SCl2 undergoes even further chlorination to give SCl4 , but this species is unstable at near room temperature . 
Disulfur dichloride , S2Cl2 , is the most common impurity in SCl2 . Separation of SCl2 from S2Cl2 is possible via distillation with PCl3 to form an azeotrope of 99 % purity
SCl2 is also a precursor to several inorganic sulfur compounds . Treatment with fluoride salts gives SF4 . Reaction with ammonia affords sulfur nitrides related to S4N4 . With H2S , SCl2 reacts to give `` lower '' sulfanes such as S3H2 .

San Francisco Bay is a shallow , productive estuary through which water draining from approximately forty percent of California , flowing in the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers from the Sierra Nevada mountains , enters the Pacific Ocean . Technically , both rivers flow into Suisun Bay , which flows through the Carquinez Strait to meet with the Napa River at the entrance to San Pablo Bay , which connects at its south end to San Francisco Bay , although the entire group of interconnected bays is often referred to as â San Francisco Bayâ .
San Francisco Bay is located in the U.S. state of California , surrounded by a contiguous region known as the San Francisco Bay Area -LRB- often simply `` the Bay Area '' -RRB- , dominated by the large cities San Francisco , Oakland , and San Jose . The waterway entrance to San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean is called Golden Gate . Across the strait spans the Golden Gate Bridge .
The Bay covers somewhere between 400 and 1,600 square miles -LRB- 1,040 to 4,160 square kilometers -RRB- , depending on which sub-bays -LRB- such as San Pablo Bay -RRB- , estuaries , wetlands , and so on are included in the measurement . The main part of the Bay measures 3 to 12 miles -LRB- 5 to 20 km -RRB- wide east-to-west and somewhere between 48 m1 and 60 m2 north-to-south . It is the largest Pacific estuary in North or South America .

Preston North End Football Club is an English professional football club located in the Deepdale area of the city of Preston , Lancashire , currently playing in the second tier of English league football , The Championship . They were a founding member of the English Football League in 1888 and were the first English football champions . They were also the first team to win ` The Double ' of the league and FA Cup .
In the past Preston were famously successful , being the first winners of `` The Double '' in English football . In 1888 â `` 89 Preston became the only team to go throughout an entire season unbeaten in both the league and FA Cup â '' also with the record of never conceding a goal in the FA Cup . Arsenal F.C. , in 2003 â `` 04 , also managed to have an unbeaten season in the top flight -LRB- although Arsenal played 38 games to Preston 's 22 -RRB- but went out of the FA Cup at the semi final stage . PNE were league champions again the following season , and have not won the title since . Their last major trophy was an FA Cup triumph in 1938 . Preston were relegated to the Second Division -LRB- currently the Football League Championship -RRB- in 1961 and have not played in the top division since . They did reach the FA Cup final in 1964 , but lost to West Ham United . Preston were relegated to the Third Division in the 1969 â `` 70 season . Preston won the Third Division title at the first attempt and so returned to the Second Division .
Bobby Charlton , an England World Cup winner from 1966 , was appointed Preston manager in 1973 , but was unable to stop them from sliding into the Third Division in his first season and left after two years in charge . A brief respite in 1978 saw them win promotion back to the Second Division , but they went down after three seasons and in 1985 fell into the Fourth Division for the first time in their history .
In 1986 , Preston finished second from bottom in the Fourth Division and only avoided dropping into the Football Conference because the other Football League members voted in favor of the division 's bottom four teams retaining their senior status .
Gender is a set of characteristics distinguishing between male and female , particularly in the cases of men and women . Depending on the context , the discriminating characteristics vary from sex to social role to gender identity . Sexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955 . Before his work , it was uncommon to use the word `` gender '' to refer to anything but grammatical categories . However , Money 's meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s , when feminist theory embraced the distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender . Today , the distinction is strictly followed in some contexts , like feminist literature , and in documents written by organizations such as the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- , but in most contexts , even in some areas of social sciences , the meaning of gender has expanded to include `` sex '' or even to replace the latter word . Although this gradual change in the meaning of gender can be traced to the 1980s , a small acceleration of the process in the scientific literature was observed when the Food and Drug Administration started to use `` gender '' instead of `` sex '' in 1993 . `` Gender '' is now commonly used even to refer to the physiology of nonhuman animals , without any implication of social gender roles .
Joan Alexandra Molinsky Sanger Rosenberg , widely known as Joan Rivers -LRB- born June 8 , 1933 -RRB- , is an Emmy Award-winning American comedian , television personality and actress . She is known for her brash manner ; her loud , raspy voice with a heavy New York accent ; and her numerous cosmetic surgeries . Rivers 's comic style relies heavily on poking fun at herself and other celebrities , mostly about their fashion sense , or according to her , the lack thereof .
Joan Rivers was born Joan Alexandra Molinsky in Brooklyn , New York , the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants Beatrice -LRB- nÃ e Grushman -RRB- and Meyer C. Molinsky . She was raised in Brooklyn , New York , and her family later moved to Larchmont , in Westchester County , New York . She attended Connecticut College between 1950 and 1952 and graduated from Barnard College in 1954 with a bachelor-of-arts degree in English literature and anthropology . Before entering show business , Rivers worked at various jobs such as a tour guide at Rockefeller Center , a writer\/proofreader at an advertising agency and as a fashion consultant at Bond Clothing Stores . During this period , an agent named Tony Rivers told her to change her name , so she suggested Joan Rivers as her new name .
The case also remains open in additional jurisdictions . George Best -LRB- 22 May 1946 â `` 25 November 2005 -RRB- was an Irish professional football player , best known for his years with Manchester United . He was a winger whose game combined pace , acceleration , balance , two-footedness , goalscoring and the ability to beat defenders . In 1968 , his annus mirabilis , he won the European Cup with Manchester United , and was named the European Footballer of the Year .
For the United States Air Force use of this facility , see Bangor Air National Guard Base and Dow Air Force Base Bangor International Airport is a joint civil-military public airport located 3 m west of the city of Bangor , in Penobscot County , Maine , United States . It is owned and operated by the City of Bangor and was formerly a military installation known as Dow Air Force Base . The airport possesses a single runway measuring 11439 f long and 200 f wide . Despite the departure of most of the Air Force presence in the late 1960s , Bangor International Airport remains the home of a small Air Force contingent in the form of an Air National Guard Base . This installation is hosted by the 101st Air Refueling Wing of the Maine Air National Guard , flying the KC-135 Stratotanker .
The airport owes its prosperity to its location on the Great Circle Route , or major air corridor , between Europe and the East Coast of the United States . The ` international ' in the airport 's name thus does n't refer to its proximity to Canada -LRB- to which it has no regular flights -RRB- , but its role in transatlantic commerce .
Bangor International is operated as an `` enterprise fund '' , which means that the expense of operating it comes from airport revenue . Revenues are generated by air service operations , resident aviation related industrial companies , real estate , cargo , international charter flights , and corporate\/general aviation traffic . The airport serves the residents of central , eastern , and northern Maine as well as parts of Canada . BGR is the airport 's official designation . The airport is one of three international airports in the state of Maine .

In geometry , a square is a regular quadrilateral . This means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles -LRB- 90 degree angles , or right angles -RRB- . A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted .
In classical times , the second power was described in terms of the area of a square , as in the above formula . This led to the use of the term square to mean raising to the second power .
A coronation is a ceremony marking the investiture of a monarch or their consort with regal power , specifically involving the placement of a crown upon his or her head , and the presentation of other items of regalia . This rite may also include the taking of a special vow , acts of homage by the new ruler 's subjects , and\/or performance of other ritual deeds of special significance to a given nation . Coronations were once a vital ritual in many of the world 's monarchies , but this changed over time due to a variety of socio-political and religious factors . While most monarchies have dispensed with formal coronation rites , preferring simpler enthronement , investiture , or benediction rites , coronations are still held in the United Kingdom , Tonga and several Asian countries . In common usage , `` coronation '' often simply refers to the official investiture or enthronement of the monarch , whether an actual crown is bestowed or not .
In addition to the investing of the monarch with a diadem and other symbols of state , coronations often involve anointing with holy oil , or chrism as it is often called . Wherever a ruler is anointed in this way , as in Great Britain and Tonga , this ritual takes on an overtly religious significance , following examples found in the Bible . Some other lands use bathing or cleansing rites , the drinking of a sacred beverage , or other religious practices to achieve a comparable effect . Such acts symbolise the granting of divine favor to the monarch within the relevant spiritual-religious paradigm of the country .

In the philosophy of naturalism , uniformitarianism assumes that the same natural laws and processes that operate in the universe now , have always operated in the universe in the past and apply everywhere in the universe . It is frequently summarized as `` the present is the key to the past , '' because it holds that all things continue as they were from the beginning of the world .
Uniformitarianism was formulated by Scottish naturalists in the late 18th century , starting with the work of the geologist James Hutton , which was refined by John Playfair and popularized by Charles Lyell 's Principles of Geology in 1830 . The term uniformitarianism was coined by William Whewell , who also coined the term catastrophism for the idea that the Earth was shaped by a series of sudden , short-lived , violent events . It is often confused with gradualism , which was just a part of Lyell 's full meaning of the term -LRB- see below -RRB- .
The earlier conceptions likely had little influence on 18th century European geological explanations for the formation of the Earth . Abraham Gottlob Werner proposed Neptunism where strata were deposits from shrinking seas precipitated onto primordial rocks such as granite . An opposing idea was set out in 1785 by James Hutton , who proposed a self-maintaining infinite cycle .
Hutton then sought evidence to support his idea that there must have been repeated cycles , each involving deposition on the seabed , uplift with tilting and erosion then undersea again for further layers to be deposited . At Glen Tilt in the Cairngorm mountains he found granite penetrating metamorphic schists , in a way which indicated to him that the presumed primordial rock had been molten after the strata had formed . He had read about angular unconformities as interpreted by Neptunists , and found an unconformity at Jedburgh where layers of greywacke in the lower layers of the cliff face have been tilted almost vertically before being eroded to form a level plane , under horizontal layers of Old Red Sandstone . In the Spring of 1788 he took a boat trip along the Berwickshire coast with John Playfair and the geologist Sir James Hall , and found a dramatic unconformity showing the same sequence at Siccar Point . Playfair later recalled that `` the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time '' , and Hutton concluded a 1788 paper he presented at the Royal Society of Edinburgh , later rewritten as a book , with the phrase `` we find no vestige of a beginning , no prospect of an end . ''
Both Playfair and Hall wrote their own books on the theory , and for decades there was a robust debate between Hutton 's supporters and the Neptunists . Georges Cuvier 's paleontological work in the 1790s , which established the reality of extinction , explained this by local catastrophes , after which other fixed species repopulated the affected areas . In Britain , geologists adapted this idea into `` diluvial theory '' which proposed repeated worldwide annihilation and creation of new fixed species adapted to a changed environment , initially identifying the most recent catastrophe as the biblical flood .
Saint Marie-Bernarde Soubirous -LRB- born Maria-Bernada SobirÃ s ; 7 January 1844-16 April 1879 -RRB- , was a miller 's daughter born in Lourdes . From 11 February to 16 July 1858 , she reported 18 apparitions of `` a small young lady . '' Despite initial scepticism from the Catholic Church , these claims were eventually declared to be worthy of belief after a canonical investigation , and the apparition is known as Our Lady of Lourdes . After her death , Bernadette 's body has remained incorrupt , and the shrine at Lourdes went on to become a major site for pilgrimage , attracting millions of Christians of all denominations each year . On 8 December 1933 , she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church ; her Feast Day is celebrated on 16 April . She is considered a Christian mystic .
Millipedes are arthropods that have two pairs of legs per segment -LRB- except for the first segment behind the head which does not have any appendages at all , and the next few which only have one pair of legs -RRB- . Each segment that has two pairs of legs is a result of two single segments fused together as one . Most millipedes have very elongated cylindrical bodies , although some are flattened dorso-ventrally , while pill millipedes are shorter and can roll into a ball , like a pillbug .
The name `` millipede '' is a compound word formed from the Latin roots ' -LRB- `` thousand '' -RRB- and ' -LRB- `` foot '' -RRB- . Despite their name , millipedes do not have 1,000 legs , although the rare species Illacme plenipes has up to 750 . Common species have between 36 and 400 legs . The class contains around 10,000 species in 13 orders and 115 families . The giant African millipede -LRB- Archispirostreptus gigas -RRB- , known as shongololos , is the largest species of millipede .

Although Camilla automatically became the Princess of Wales upon her marriage to Prince Charles , she prefers to be known by the lesser title of Duchess of Cornwall , avoiding confusion with the Prince of Wales ' first wife , Diana , Princess of Wales . '' She uses this title everywhere except Scotland , where she is styled Duchess of Rothesay .
Born at King 's College Hospital , London , on 17 July 1947 , Camilla was raised opposite the Plumpton Racecourse , Plumpton , East Sussex by her parents , Major Bruce Shand -LRB- 1917 â `` 2006 -RRB- -LRB- a British Army officer turned wine merchant , as well as prisoner of war in World War II and recipient of the Military Cross and Bar -RRB- and The Honourable Rosalind Cubitt -LRB- 1921 â `` 1994 , eldest child of Roland Calvert Cubitt , 3rd Baron Ashcombe -RRB- : her siblings are Mark and Annabel . She was christened on 1 November 1947 at Firle Church , Sussex , and her godparents were the Hon Harry Cubitt -LRB- her maternal uncle -RRB- ; Major Neil Speke ; Mrs Heathcoat Amory ; Mrs Lombard Hobson ; Miss Vivien Mosley . Camilla attended Dumbrells School in Sussex , as well as Queen 's Gate School in Kensington . She subsequently attended the Mon Fertile finishing school in Switzerland and studied at the Institut Britannique in Paris . Following her education , she worked for a year at the offices of designers Sybil Colefax & John Fowler . She also became an avid equestrienne and participated in fox hunting .
On 4 July 1973 , Camilla married Andrew Parker Bowles , at the Guards Chapel , Wellington Barracks , London , their bridesmaids including Parker Bowles ' goddaughter Lady Emma Herbert . The couple had two children : Tom , born in the year after the marriage , who is a godson of Prince Charles , and Laura , born in 1978 ; both Parker Bowles children were raised in their father 's Roman Catholic faith , although both were married in the Church of England . Andrew Parker Bowles initiated divorce proceedings against Camilla following the admission by the Prince of Wales that he had conducted a long-term extramarital affair with Camilla ; the couple 's divorce was finalized on 3 March 1995 .
It has , however , been restored and is maintained with all religious symbols intact and is now used by the Municipality of Kos for various events , mainly cultural . Crete is the largest and most populous of the Greek islands and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean Sea . It forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece ; while it retains its own local cultural traits -LRB- such as its own dialect , poetry , and music -RRB- .
Crete was the center of the Minoan civilization -LRB- circa 2700 â `` 1420 BC -RRB- , the first civilization in Europe and the first European country with a palace -LRB- at Knossos -RRB- . Under Roman rule , in Classical Latin , the island was called Creta . Under Venetian rule , it was known as Candia -LRB- sometimes anglicized as ` Candy ' -RRB- , a Venetian adaptation of the earlier Greek name Chandax -LRB- , `` moat '' -RRB- or Chandakas , which in turn came from the Arabic rabá al - á `` andaq ` castle of the moat ' .
Under Ottoman rule , in Turkish , it was called Girit . Crete is the largest island in Greece and the second largest in the eastern Mediterranean Sea -LRB- after Cyprus -RRB- .
It is located in the south of the Aegean Sea separating the Aegean from the Libyan Sea . The island has an elongated shape : it spans 260 k from east to west , is 60 k at its widest point , and narrows to as little as 12 k -LRB- close to Ierapetra -RRB- . Crete covers an area of 8336 k , with a coastline of 1046 k ; to the north , it broaches the Sea of Crete -LRB- Greek : Î Ï Î Ï Î Î Ï Î Î Î '' Î Î Î Ï -RRB- ; to the south , the Libyan Sea -LRB- Greek : Î Î Î Ï Î Ï Î Î Î '' Î Î Î Ï -RRB- ; in the west , the Myrtoan Sea , and toward the east the Karpathion Sea .
It lies approximately 160 k south of the Greek mainland . Crete is extremely mountainous , and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east , formed by three different groups of mountains .
These are :
These mountains gifted Crete with valleys , such as Amari valley , fertile plateaus , such as Lasithi plateau , Omalos and Nidha ; caves , such as Diktaion and Idaion -LRB- the birthplace of the ancient Greek god Zeus -RRB- ; and a number of gorges .
The island has a number of gorges such as the famous gorge of Samaria , the Imbros Gorge , the Kourtaliotiko Gorge , the Ha Gorge , the Platania Gorge , and the gorge of the dead -LRB- at Kato Zakros , Lasithi -RRB- . The rivers of Crete include the Ieropotamos River , the Koiliaris , the Anapodiaris , the Almiros , and Megas Potamos . There are only two freshwater lakes including Lake Kournas and Lake Agia which are both in Chania prefecture .
Lake Voulismeni at the coast , at Aghios Nikolaos , was formerly a sweetwater lake but is now connected with the sea , in Lasithi . A large number of islands , islets , and rocks hug the coast of Crete . Many are visited by tourists , some are visited only by archaeologists and biologists . Some are environmentally protected .
