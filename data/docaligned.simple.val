The Essjay controversy is about a well known Wikipedia administrator and salaried Wikia worker , Essjay , who later said he was Ryan Jordan .
In February 2007 , Essjay was discovered to have made false claims about his school certificates and job experiences on his Wikipedia user page and to news reporter Stacy Schiff during a report for The New Yorker .
Many people reacted in many ways to the controversy . Many articles and comments were made electronic , print , and broadcast media ; the Wikipedia community checked Essjay 's article changes to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project 's handling of personal identification . In his activities as an editor , Essjay had spent less time changing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes .
Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales supported Essjay 's use of an identity , saying , `` I regard it as a pseudonym and I donâ t really have a problem with it . '' Later Wales changed his opinion and asked for Essjay to quit from his jobs with Wikipedia and Wikia . Wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned `` that EssJay used his false credentials in content disputes '' on Wikipedia .
Stacy Schiff , a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter writing for The New Yorker , interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about Wikipedia . -LRB- `` Know It All '' ; July 31 , 2006 -RRB- He was suggested for this to her by a member of the Wikimedia Foundation . The New Yorker , said Essjay `` was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page . ''
During the interview , Jordan told The New Yorker and had said on his Wikipedia user page that he had doctoral degrees in theology and canon law . He also said he worked as a tenured professor at a private university . It was later found that he was 24 years old and had quit community college with no qualifications . The New Yorker published a correction in February 2007 , which brought the issue to broader public attention .
The article said that Essjay was on Wikipedia some 14 hours or more a day . The article also said he was careful to keep his online life a secret from his co-workers and friends . Essjay was pictured as taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz . He said that he needed anonymity to avoid cyberstalking .
Essjay said that he had sent an email to a college professor using his false persona 's credentials , telling for Wikipedia 's accuracy . In the message he wrote in part , `` I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project Wikipedia . I am also a tenured professor of theology ; feel free to have a look at my Wikipedia userpage -LRB- linked below -RRB- to gain an idea of my background and credentials . ''
When Essjay was hired by Wikia in January 2007 , he made changes to his Wikia profile and `` came clean on who he really was , '' showing himself as Ryan Jordan . Other Wikipedia editors asked Essjay questions on his Wikipedia talk page about the difference between his new Wikia profile and his previously claimed credentials . Essjay posted a reason in response to the first question , saying that :
He later said on his Wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by `` doing a good job playing the part . ''
Social activist and Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then told `` The New Yorker '' about the difference in profiles . In late February 2007 the magazine updated its article with a change -LRB- correction -RRB- saying that `` Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan , that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees , and that he has never taught . ''
On March 3 , 2007 , Andrew Lih , Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong , said on his blog that a part of Essjay 's comments on the incident entered `` the dangerous domain of defamation and libel '' against Stacy Schiff . Lih quoted Essjay as writing on his Wikipedia talk page : `` Further , she -LRB- Schiff -RRB- made several offers to compensate me for my time , and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so , she should donate to the Foundation instead . '' Lih noted :
Lih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email . In it Schiff said that Essjay 's statement was `` complete nonsense . ''
Talking about Jordan , Wales said , â Mr. Ryan was a friend , and still is a friend . He is a young man , and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology , which I have accepted . I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation . â
Reaction from inside the Wikipedia community to the Essjay\/Jordan identity difference was pointed . There were many comments . While most editors opposed at least some of his actions , responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud .
As the controversy went further , the Wikipedia community began looking at Essjay 's previous changes . Some felt he had relied upon his false professorship to prove he was right about his changes . `` People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments , '' said Michael Snow , a Wikipedia administrator and founder of the Wikipedia community newspaper , The Wikipedia Signpost . `` Those will get looked at again . '' For instance , Essjay had recommended sources such as Catholicism for Dummies , a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church . Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur : `` This is a text I often require for my students , and I would hang my own Ph. D. on itâ s credibility . ''
Wales was '' ... reported to be considering vet all persons who adjudicate on factual disputes . '' `` I do n't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia , but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address , '' Wales added . He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished . `` We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition , so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle '' , Wales commented . However , he also warned that â It 's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials , and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate . â Wales argued `` contributors to the site who claim certain credentials will soon have to prove they really have them . '' However , Florence Devouard , chair of the Wikimedia Foundation , was not supportive of his credential suggestion , saying , `` I think what matters is the quality of the content , which we can improve by enforcing policies such as ` cite your source , ' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor . '' A formal suggestion that users saying to have qualification would have to give something to prove they really do have them , before using them was rejected by the Wikipedia community , like all previous such suggestions .
Wales stated his regret that Essjay had `` made a series of very bad judgments . '' He said he hopes the Wkipedia would be better off from the controversy .
Andrew Orlowski , a Wikipedia critic and writer for The Registerâ '' a British technology news and opinion websiteâ '' criticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture-capital-funded ` Wikia ' and for making him a member on the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee . Essjay had admitted his stated academic and professional credentials were false before he was made a member . Orlowski added that Essjay 's actions showed a harmful community way of thinking inside Wikipedia .
Others to comment negatively included ZDNet writer Mitch Ratcliffe . Ratcliffe asked `` why lying about one 's background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia , which proposes to help communities to record accurate information '' and asked for additional details `` such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing , as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements . ''
Larry Sanger , editor-in-chief of online encyclopedia Citizendium , and a co-founder of Wikipedia who quit the project in 2002 , called Essjay 's response `` a defiant non-apology '' and elsewhere stated Essjay 's actions as `` identity fraud . '' Showing comments by Essjay on his Wikipedia talk pages , Sanger stated that other members of Wikipedia management , including Angela Beesley -LRB- co-founder of Wikia and a member of Wikimedia Foundation 's Communications Committee -RRB- and Brad Patrick -LRB- legal counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation -RRB- had worked in hiring Jordan when they knew of the identity difference . Sanger also made note that Jordan 's dismissal was the result of public response . That `` Only after these sad facts were publicly made aware , only after there was a response , did Jimmy Wales decide to ask for Essjayâ s to quit . ''
Following the media broadcast of the Essjay controversy , a number of people noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia . On March 2 , 2007 , a report in The Chronicle of Higher Education commented `` the incident is clearly damaging to Wikipedia 's credibilityâ '' especially with professors who will now note that one of the site 's most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud . '' Ross Brann , a professor of Judeo-Islamic classes at Cornell University in Ithaca , stated that Wikipedia is without a way to expertly review , saying , `` They could make up your life if they wanted to . '' Brann also said that Wikipedia `` has no place in the University , '' and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the negative opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia . Students at Cornell stated that they may continue to use Wikipedia as a quick source of information , though they would not cite it in scholarly work .
Resource room is a place where special education students attend daily classes . These students are usually included in the general classroom and just need more support . Students are taught individually and in small groups . The number of students in a resource room is at most five students per teacher . Mainstreaming in education typically includes this service . Students in separate classes generally do not need the resource room because all the support they need is in the self-contained classroom .
Special education teachers in resource rooms focus on the goals set by an Individualized Education Program . These goals are based on the individual student 's need to develop executive skills , complete their homework and behave . The programs can help students with language-based learning disabilities like dyslexia . Visuo-motor perception , arithmetic , spelling and overall self-perception improve after time in the resource room classroom . The small-group instructional model leads to achievement in students with a multitude of educational disabilities .
Their peers also benefit when the concepts they learned in general education are reinforced in resource rooms .

The Finke River is one of the largest rivers in central Australia . It starts in the MacDonnell Ranges in the Northern Territory . it is formed where Davenport and Ormiston Creeks join together , just north of Glen Helen . The Finke River flows about 600 km to the western edge of the Simpson Desert in northern South Australia . Usually the river is a collection of waterholes , but it can become a raging torrent during rare flood events . In a big flood water from the Finke River can flow into the Macumba River , and then into Lake Eyre , a total distance of about 750 km . Major tributaries include Ellery Creek , and the Palmer and Hugh Rivers . The Finke River flows through the West MacDonnell and Finke Gorge National Parks .
The Finke River was named by John McDouall Stuart in 1860 after William Finke , an Adelaide man , who was one of the people who paid part of the cost of his expeditions . The indigenous name for the river in parts of the Northern Territory is Larapinta . . Larapinta Drive is a road which runs west from Alice Springs , and the Larapinta walking trail .
The Finke River has been called `` the oldest river in the world '' , particularly by tour operators , and in popular books and brochures . In places such as the James Range , the Finke flows through deeply incised meanders -LRB- see Google Maps image -RRB- . Because meanders only form on flat plains , the river must have formed before the ranges were pushed up . This happened in a mountain building event known as the Alice Springs Orogeny which happened between 400 and 300 million years ago , in the Devonian to Carboniferous Periods . . Some parts of the riverâ s course must have been already in existence around this time . The southern parts of its course must be much younger because the areas where the Finke now flows near the southern edge of the Northern Territory , and further south , were under the sea during the Mesozoic Era , part of the Great Artesian Basin .
The age of the Finke River is not unique . There are other large mountain-sourced river systems in central Australia including the Todd and Hale Rivers where the mountains were formed at the same time . . There are other mountain ranges of equal or greater age to the MacDonnell Ranges , both in Australia and on other continents . The rivers in those areas may have evolved from ancestral streams of of the same age or older than the Finke .
Fort Worth is the fifth largest city in Texas and the 18th largest in the United States of America . It has gotten so big that it has overlapped the next biggest city next to it , Dallas , Texas . Because of this , the area is often referred to as Dallas\/Ft . Worth , or DFW .
Fort Worth is the county seat of Tarrant County . Texas Motor Speedway is also located in Fort Worth .
Reason or reasoning is a way of thinking that uses logic and facts . People use reason to try to be certain about what is true or best . It is different from obeying tradition or emotions to decide what things are best or true . In common English , it is using your head instead of your heart .
Reason has been an important part of philosophy since Ancient Greece . Many philosophers have thought about what reason is , how to think using reason -LRB- Logic -RRB- , if religious thinking and faith are ways of reasoning , what we can know if we only use reason -LRB- Epistemology -RRB- , and if animals or computers can think using reason .

Perpetual motion refers to a movement that goes on forever once started without additional energy added . A machine that could be set in motion once would continue to move forever . Such a device or system would be against the law of conservation of energy . This law states that energy can not be created , or destroyed , but one form of energy can be transformed into a different one .
Perpetual motion machines have interested inventors for a long time , and even though it has been shown that such a machine can not exist , people still try to build them .
Perpetual motion machines have been classified into different types . Each type breaks a different law of thermodynamics :
A fanfare is a short , showy , piece of music usually played for a special event . It is often played to announce the arrival of an important person , such as a king or queen . Fanfares are usually played by trumpets and other brass instruments , often with drums . The word fanfare can also used to mean an event with a lot of publicity , even if there is no actual music .
Fanfares began in the Middle Ages . Modern movies often show trumpets playing fanfares in ancient Rome but there is little evidence that this ever happened . In 18th century France , the fanfare was a piece of music with energy and repeated notes . Modern fanfares come from the 19th century in Britain where they were written for important state events such as the crowning of a king or queen . Hubert Parry wrote a fanfare , `` I Was Glad '' , for the coronation of Edward VII .
Fanfares are used today as music at the start of television and radio news programs . Often they are used as victory marches in video games , particularly Role Playing Games . Fanfares are also seen at military parades and events . The British Army bands all have a special teams of between four and eight trumpet players to play fanfares . The new University for the Creative Arts in England has asked composer Edward Gregson to write a fanfare to play at its graduation ceremonies .
A special trumpet , usually called a herald trumpet , is often used to play fanfares . The fanfare trumpet has a long straight tube , which often can have a banner hanging from it . There are three sizes of fanfare trumpet , a Bb trumpet , tenor trumpet and a bass trumpet .

In rail transport , a retarder is a device put in a classification yard used to slow down the speed of freight cars as they are sorted into trains . Each retarder has a series of stationary brakes around a short section of each rail on the track that hold and slow the cars ' wheels through friction as they roll through them . Modern retarders are computer worked to have the perfect amount of pressure on the wheels so that cars rolling down a yard 's hump are slowed to a safe speed for coupling with cars already standing on the yard 's tracks .

A metronome is a small object that can be used by people who are practising instruments to help them to play in time . It is also something a composer can use to show the performer what speed to play .
A traditional metronome works by clockwork . It has a pendulum which makes a loud tick as it goes to and fro , like the pendulum of a grandfather clock . It has to be wound up after a few minutes of ticking . There is a weight on the pendulum which can be slid up or down and set to a particular speed . There are numbers on the metronome to which you can set it . These numbers mean the number of ticks per minutes . A speed of 60 will make it tick 60 times a minute -LRB- i.e. every second -RRB- . The numbers usually go from 40 -LRB- slow -RRB- to 208 -LRB- very fast -RRB- . Nowadays many people use electronic metronomes . These are very accurate and often have other helpful things like an A to tune to -LRB- see musical tuning -RRB- . Some of them are hardly bigger than a credit card .
The metronome was invented by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel in Amsterdam in 1812 . A man called Johann Maelzel copied Winkelâ s ideas and improved them . He made a small , portable metronome which was patented in 1816 .
The metronome made it possible for a composer to show the performer what speed he wanted . If the composer writes at the top of his music : Crotchet -LRB- quarter note -RRB- = 76 , for example , then the metronome can be set at 76 and it will tick at the right speed for that piece of music . Sometimes they write `` MM76 '' . The `` MM '' stands for `` Maelzel 's Metronome '' . Beethoven was the first composer to use metronome markings , but he often gave very fast speed indications , and some people wonder whether he made mistakes or whether his metronome worked properly .

Southwark is the main part of the inner London Borough of Southwark . It is on the Thames , south of London Bridge . It is often called just ` The Borough ' . Southwark was once a separate town in Surrey , and was made part of London in 1889 .
Southwark has several important buildings : Southwark Cathedral , London Bridge station and the Tate Modern art gallery . Two Roman roads met in Southwark : Watling Street and Stane Street . The area was marshy with islands in Roman times . They built the first London Bridge here .
The word ` Southwark ' is pronounced Suthuk .
`` Just Say No '' was an advertising campaign , part of the United States `` War on Drugs '' , which was waged during the 1980s and early 1990s , to discourage kids from trying drugs by offering various ways of saying no. . Eventually , this also expanded the realm of `` Just Say No '' to violence , sex , and any other naughty things that young people might try . The slogan was created and championed by First Lady of the United States Nancy Reagan during her husband 's presidency .

A flywheel is a heavy disk or wheel that is attached to a rotating shaft . Flywheels are used for storage of kinetic energy . The momentum of the flywheel causes it to not change its rotational speed easily . Because of this , flywheels help to keep the shaft rotating at the same speed . This helps when the torque applied to the shaft changes often . Uneven torque can change the speed of rotation . Because the flywheel resists changes in speed , it decreases the effects of uneven torque . Engines which use pistons to provide power usually have uneven torque and use flywheels to fix this problem .
It takes energy to get a wheel -LRB- any wheel -RRB- to rotate . If there is little friction -LRB- good bearings -RRB- then it will keep rotating a long time . When energy is needed , it can be taken from the wheel again . So it is a simple mechanical means of storing energy . The amount of energy stored is a function of the weight and the speed of rotation - making a heavier wheel rotate faster takes more energy . Another factor is the radius -LRB- size -RRB- because the farther from the axis a part of the wheel is , the more energy it takes to make is rotate . These three factor can be represented by M -LRB- mass -RRB- , -LRB- angular velocity -RRB- and R -LRB- radius -RRB- . Combining the two equations below gives 2MR2\/4 . A fly-wheel is not just any wheel , but specifically designed to store energy . So it should be heavy and\/or rotate fast . For example , some buses have a fly-wheel that is used for stopping and starting . When the bus stops -LRB- eg for a traffic light -RRB- , the fly-wheel is connected to the wheels , so the rotational energy is transferred to it , so the bus will slow down while the fly-wheel speeds up . Then , when the bus has to start driving again , it is connected again and the energy is transferred back . Of course , you would n't want to lug a heavy wheel around on a bus , so it is made of a lighter material that can withstand extremely fast rotation .
where is the moment of inertia of the mass about the center of rotation and -LRB- omega -RRB- is the angular velocity in radian units .
The flywheel has been used since ancient times , the most common traditional example being the potter 's wheel . In the Industrial Revolution , James Watt contributed to the development of the flywheel in the steam engine , and his contemporary James Pickard used a flywheel .
In the world of venture capital , the term `` flywheel '' is used to represent the recurrent , margin-generating heart of a business .
X-Men : The Last Stand is a 2006 movie . It is the third movie based on the Marvel Comics ' X-Men superhero comic books . The story takes place after X-Men -LRB- 2000 -RRB- and X2 -LRB- 2003 -RRB- . Brett Ratner directed the movie . He took over when Bryan Singer decided to direct Superman Returns . The movie is about a `` mutant cure '' and the resurrection of Jean Grey , who seemed to have died in X2 . The movie is partially based on two X-Men comic book stories : writer Chris Claremont 's and artist John Byrne 's `` Dark Phoenix Saga '' in The Uncanny X-Men -LRB- 1980 -RRB- and writer Joss Whedon 's and artist John Cassaday 's six-issue `` Gifted '' story in Astonishing X-Men -LRB- 2004 -RRB- .
The movie was released May 26 , 2006 in the United States and Canada . It was released one or two days earlier in more than 20 other countries . The movie did well at theaters .

Meanwhile , a large company working at Alcatraz Island has found a way to erase the gene that is the cause for mutation . This discovery splits the mutants apart . Some believe that their mutation helps society and do not want a cure for it and start protesting . Other mutants do not like their mutation and begin lining up at Alcatraz Island to get the cure . At the Xavier Institute , Rogue , who longs to touch people but can not , is interested in the cure .
Professor Xavier tracks down Jean Grey . He and Wolverine and Storm go Jean 's old house to try to talk to her . Early on , he found that Jean Grey had a very powerful side called the Phoenix . To make sure that side never came out , he put up a mind barrier . During the talk , the Phoenix comes out and he and Jean Grey have a mind battle . It ends when the Phoenix overpowers the Professor and the Professor dies .
The villain Magneto has started to put his Brotherhood of Mutants together . While freeing his right-hand man Mystique from jail , a guard fires a `` cure dart '' at him to try to remove his mutation . Mystique jumps in the way and is cured of her mutation .

Matrix mechanics is the first way that physicists found to express quantum physics in mathematical form . Werner Heisenberg initially developed this form of expression of the laws of physics just as an equation that he could use to predict the intensities of the photons in the various bands of the hydrogen spectrum .
Heisenberg 's teacher and colleague , Max Born , saw that his equation was essentially the plan for creating and multiplying matrices . The matrix form of quantum physics is still used since it is useful and convenient for some purposes . Other mathematical ways , particularly Erwin SchrÃ dinger 's equation using a wave function , are mathematically equivalent but are easier to use for other purposes .
One of the early successes of this theory was announced shortly thereafter and is now called the Heisenberg 's Uncertainty Principle .

Samuel Reshevsky -LRB- Szmul Rzeszewski , near Å Ã dÅ , 26 November 1911 â `` New York , 4 April 1992 -RRB- was a Polish-American chess Grandmaster .
Sammy was a famous chess prodigy , and later a leading American chess Grandmaster . He was a contender for the World Chess Championship from about 1935 to the mid-1960s . He came equal third in the World Chess Championship 1948 tournament , and equal second in the 1953 Candidates Tournament . He was also an eight-time winner of the U.S. Chess Championship .
He was the greatest American player in the long period between Pillsbury -LRB- d. 1906 -RRB- and Fischer . Sammy was an Orthodox Jew , and did not play on the Jewish Sabbath : his tournament games were re-arranged . He was a regular top board for the USA at Chess Olympiads . He played in eight Olympiads , helping the U.S. team to win the gold in 1937 . p335
Sammy was tremendously strong in matches , and the Soviets made sure he never got the chance to play Botvinnik in a match . He played eleven of the first twelve world champions , and drew a match against Fischer at the age of 49 . His one weakness as a player was his time trouble . He used up so much of his time in the early stages of a game that he was often short of time at the end . This probably cost him the Candidates tournament in 1953 .
Reshevsky was not a full-time chess player . He was a qualified accountant .
The Dead Kennedys were a hardcore punk band from San Francisco . The band was led by Jello Biafra . Other original members were Klaus Flouride , D.H. Peligro , and East Bay Ray .

Grupo Santander is a banking group centered on Banco Santander , the largest bank in the Eurozone . Grupo Santander is one of the largest banks in the world -LRB- in terms of market capitalization -RRB- . It originated in Santander , Cantabria , Spain .
Banco Hispanoamericano was created in 1900 . Banco Central was created in 1919 . Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamericano merged . Banco Santander was founded in 1857 . Banco Central Hispano was founded in 1991 . In 1999 , Banco Santander and Banco Central Hispano merged , creating Banco Santander Central Hispano , or BSCH .
The 1999 merger between Santander and Central Hispano was designed to be a `` merger of equals '' . The the top executives of the two firms would share control of the new firm . Soon after the merger former Central Hispano executives thought chairman Botin of trying to control the firm . They threatened to take legal action against him . The issue was resolved when Central Hispano the executives agreed to severance payments -LRB- money given when leaving a company -RRB- , retirement . They also turned control of the firm over to Mr. Botin . This action cost the shareholders of the firm â 164M .
Because of the large payouts , Mr. Botin was brought to trial on criminal charges of `` misappropriation of funds '' -LRB- using company money the wrong way -RRB- and `` irresponsible management . '' In April 2005 he was cleared of all charges . The decision said the retirement payments made were legal , `` made as compensation for the services provided to the bank . ''

279 Thule is a very big Main belt asteroid . It is classified as a D-type asteroid and is probably made of organic rich silicates , carbon and anhydrous silicates .
The orbit of Thule is unusual . It appears to orbit in the farthest edge of the Main belt in a 3:4 orbital resonance with planet Jupiter . Unlike the Hilda asteroids whose eccentricity is fairly common of main belt asteroids , Thule has a very low eccentricity - actually much lower than that of Jupiter itself and only a bit higher than that of Earth . Why it has this orbit is not clear , as is the reason for the absence of smaller bodies in similar 4:3 resonances with Jupiter .
Some astronomers have argued that Thule 's present orbit is the natural result of the force of Jupiter on a body orbiting at exactly the distance from the Sun Thule does , in the same way -LRB- though with the reverse effect -RRB- as the Kirkwood gaps in the more closer parts of the asteroid belt . It could thus be that the resonance which holds Thule in a very low-eccentricity orbit serves to eject other smaller bodies whose distance from the Sun is only a bit different from that of Thule itself .
It is the main member of the Thule dynamical group .
It was found by Johann Palisa on October 25 , 1888 in Vienna and was named aptly after the ultimate northern land of Thule .

Classical economics is the first modern school of economic thought . Its main developers include Adam Smith , Jean-Baptiste Say , David Ricardo , Thomas Malthus and John Stuart Mill .
Adam Smith 's book The Wealth of Nations -LRB- 1776 -RRB- was the beginning of classical economics . Smith said that if everyone did what was best for themselves , the result would be best for society . Before that , economics was about the king 's personal interests , and the wealth of a nation was measured by the king 's treasury . Smith said what 's important is what 's best for the whole nation , and that wealth should be measured by the yearly income of the nation . He wanted to discover how wealth can grow , and how people could do things to support that growth . Smith 's book said land , labor , and capital were the three `` factors of production '' and the main contributors to a nation 's wealth .
Prices naturally adjust to having more or less of something : supply and demand . If there is too much of something -LRB- more supply -RRB- , prices go down so that people have more reason to buy it . If a lot of people want something -LRB- high demand -RRB- , there may not be enough of it -LRB- scarcity -RRB- ; there will be a competition among the people who want to buy it , and some people will agree to pay more to get what they want , and prices go up .
Smith said markets should be free . At the time , some big companies -LRB- like the East India Company -RRB- were controlled by the government . Sometimes the rulers made laws that were good for themselves but not for workers or customers . For example , in the American colonies , colonists could grow cotton but were not allowed to make clothing from it . They had to ship it to England to be made into clothing , then buy it back after it was finished . Smith said this was bad for individuals and for society . He thought it was better for money to flow freely and naturally between buyers and sellers without outside interference . Money would naturally go to the sellers who made the best product at the best price . This way if people did what was best for them , it would end up being best for society as a whole , almost like an `` invisible hand '' was guiding everything .

In cryptography , a Feistel cipher is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers , named after the German IBM cryptographer Horst Feistel ; it is also commonly known as a Feistel network . A large set of block ciphers use the scheme , including the Data Encryption Standard -LRB- DES -RRB- .
The Feistel structure has the advantage that encryption and decryption operations are very similar , even identical in some cases , requiring only a reversal of the key schedule . Therefore the size of the code or circuitry required to implement such a cipher is nearly halved .
Feistel construction is iterative in nature which makes implementing the cryptosystem in hardware easier .
to produce a function with large amounts of what Claude Shannon described as `` confusion and diffusion '' .
Bit shuffling creates the diffusion effect , while substitution is used for confusion .
Many modern symmetric block ciphers uses Feistel networks , and the structure and properties of Feistel ciphers have been extensively explored by cryptographers . Specifically , Michael Luby and Charles Rackoff analyzed the Feistel block cipher construction , and proved that if the round function is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom function , with Ki used as the seed , then 3 rounds is sufficient to make the block cipher a pseudorandom permutation , while 4 rounds is sufficient to make it a `` strong '' pseudorandom permutation -LRB- which means that it remains pseudorandom even to an adversary who gets oracle access to its inverse permutation -RRB- . Because of this very important result of Luby and Rackoff , Feistel ciphers are sometimes called Luby-Rackoff block ciphers . Further theoretical studies generalized the construction , and defined more precise limits for security .
Then is the plaintext again .
One advantage of this model is that the round function does not have to be invertible , and can be very complex .
The diagram illustrates the encryption process . Decryption requires only reversing the order of the subkey using the same process ; this is the only difference between encryption and decryption :
Unbalanced Feistel ciphers use a modified structure where and are not of equal lengths . The MacGuffin cipher is an experimental example of such a cipher .
The Feistel construction is also used in cryptographic algorithms other than block ciphers . For example , the Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding -LRB- OAEP -RRB- scheme uses a simple Feistel network to randomize ciphertexts in certain asymmetric-key encryption schemes .

The Shabbat day -LRB- also known as the Sabbath Day -RRB- is the 7th day of the week in Judaism . Usually , it is a day of rest . This has its origins in Creation , when God made the Earth for six days , and stopped work on the seventh day . The Shabbat day starts Friday evening when the sun goes down , until Saturday night .
According to Kabbalah , the Shabbat day is meant to be like a perfect world in which everyone knows about God and loves Him , a kind of world that has not been since the Garden of Eden , and will not be again until the Messiah comes .
On Shabbat , work is not allowed according to the Ten Commandments . It is a day of rest and of Torah study . Most machines may not be used , and no work done . Not even a light switch can be used , according to Orthodox Judaism , but not all Jewish groups do this . It is also prohibited to cut wheat or shear sheep .
The Sabbath in Christianity comes from the Jewish Shabbat , but most Christians have it on Sunday , not Saturday . They also rest , but not the same way as Jews . The exact way depends on denomination .
Islam also has a Day of Rest , which also comes from Shabbat . In Islam it is on Friday , and is called `` Yawm al-Jamme ` a , '' the `` Day of Gathering '' -LRB- For prayer -RRB- .

Edward , however , is only concerned for her health , and after hearing stories from a local woman -LRB- who suspects that Edward is a vampire -RRB- of similar situations that resulted in the mothers ' deaths , Edward wants to get rid of the baby . Book one ends as Edward prepares to bring Bella home where he says that Carlisle will `` take care of it , '' and as Bella secretly calls Rosalie for help .
The book is told from Jacob 's perspective . He receives news of Edward and Bella 's return , and that Carlisle has told Charlie that Bella is quarantined because she has contracted a rare disease in South America . Jacob assumes that Bella has been bitten and transformed . He is upset when Sam Uley , acting Alpha of the pack , declares that the pack will not retaliate . Jacob , full of anger , decides that if the pack will not retaliate collectively , he will act alone . Formulating strategies of attack , he runs to the Cullen house . When he arrives , however , he discovers that things are n't as he expected . Bella , as opposed to being a newborn vampire , is already heavily pregnant with Edward 's and her child . It is clear that the child 's rapid growth is starving and hurting Bella .
When Jacob returns to his wolf state , his thoughts inadvertently inform the pack of Bella 's state . This causes fear and anger among the werewolves ; they do n't know how the child might act since the child is an offspring of a vampire . Sam commands the pack in the double-timbre of the Alpha , to obey his decision to destroy Bella and her unborn child . Jacob , who still loves Bella , disagrees , revolts , assumes his inherited Alpha position and leaves Sam 's pack . Seth , then Leah Clearwater , soon join Jacob and the threesome form a pack with Jacob as Alpha . Jacob , Leah and Seth patrol the Cullen territory to forewarn the family of any impending werewolf attack .
As the fetus continues to develop at an alarmingly accelerated rate , Bella 's health worsens . During Bella 's pregnancy , Edward realizes he can read the child 's mind , and is astonished to discover that the baby already loves Bella . As he hears his child 's thoughts , Edward begins to love the baby as well . This leaves Jacob feeling betrayed , as he was counting on Edward to hate the baby more than he .
Bella goes into labor approximately a month after the honeymoon . The hard placenta that surrounds the child cracks ; Bella begins vomiting blood . The child breaks free and Bella is very near death . Edward delivers the baby , a girl , and begins CPR , then transforms Bella into a vampire . He injects his venom into her heart and bites her in several places . Believing that Bella is dead and that there is no hope she will be resuscitated , Jacob leaves the room and goes to kill the baby whom he holds responsible . He finds her in Rosalie 's arms and looks into the baby 's eyes . They are exactly the same shade of brown as Bella 's . Jacob imprints on her .
The book returns to Bella 's perspective . She has just given birth to her daughter , and is now experiencing the painful transformation from human to vampire . After two days , she opens her eyes . The Cullens are wary of Bella as newborn-vampires are volatile . Yet , Bella manages to exhibit some self-control unseen in normal newborns . She wishes to see her daughter , Renesmee , but since Renesmee is part-human , the family believes Bella will be unable to control her newborn thirst if she sees the child so soon without first hunting . Edward takes Bella on her first hunt to ease her thirst . Before they leave , Alice shows Bella her reflection . She has transformed into a stunningly beautiful woman with flawless skin and newborn-vampire red eyes . Bella does not recognize her reflection at first due to her volatile-looking red eyes .
Upon returning , Bella is allowed to see her daughter because of her demonstration of self-control in the woods when she smelled humans approaching . Because Renesmee is growing at an astonishing rate , she looks older than her calendar age . Bella learns of Renesmee 's gift - the ability to communicate by sending images to people 's minds through touch . Bella is infuriated when she learns that Jacob has imprinted on Renesmee , and says it is his fault that he has imprinted on her child . She loses her self-control and she tries to attack Jacob . She breaks Seth 's collarbone and shoulder when he steps between the two . She then manages to calm down . Renesmee leads to a truce between the Quilleutes and the Cullens because of Jacob 's imprinting . Differences between Sam and Jacob 's packs are soon settled as well and they become co-existent Alphas .
Unfortunately for the Cullen family , Irina , a vampire from the Denali clan , sees Renesmee and mistakenly informs the Volturi that Renesmee is a forbidden immortal child . The Cullen family understands that Irina is mistaken and decides the only way to enlighten the Volturi and prevent an attack is to present Renesmee with a large group of credible witnesses .
After leaving a note with Sam Uley from the copyright page of Shakespeare 's The Merchant of Venice , Alice and Jasper suddenly leave the Cullens . Since the couple does not provide a warning or reason , the Cullen family does not know why the couple has fled , and assumes that Alice has foreseen there is no hope for the situation . Since it was her copy of the book , Bella perceives this as a sign from Alice . She returns to the cottage and she finds that Alice has written a name and address on another page of the book . When Bella goes to the address , she finds that it leads to the office of a lawyer who can forge documents . Bella requests documents for Jacob and Renesmee , should they need to escape if a fight ensues with the Volturi . Meanwhile , nomadic , vegetarian , and clans of vampires arrive at the Cullen estate after the family begins to seek their friends ' assistance with the Volturi . Most of them are enthralled by Renesemee , and almost all agree to bear witness to the Volturi that she is not an immortal child .
Bella also discovers that her power of mind-privacy has a shielding effect and she wonders if she can extend this protection to others . During the month of preparation for the Volturi , several of the vampires with quantifiable supernatural talents teach Bella how to expand the barrier . When the Volturi and Irina finally arrive , all of the vampires and the werewolves meet in a clearing in the forest . The Volturi discover that they have been misinformed and immediately execute Irina for her mistake . However , the Volturi are not satisfied to leave because the Volturi leaders want the exceptionally gifted vampires to join them . Those on Bella 's side are protected when Bella 's shield disables the Volturi 's offensive fighters , Alec and Jane . Aro , Caius and Marcus decide to vote on whether or not Renesmee will be a danger to the vampire world when she attains maturity . Just before Aro can cast his deciding vote , Alice and Jasper return with another half-human , half-vampire from South America who is about one hundred fifty years-old . He and his three half-sisters -LRB- who are also half-vampire , half-human -RRB- are the children of a vampire who is creating a `` super race . '' They have never caused any danger to the vampire world . Facing no other choice , Aro chooses to give up the fight , and the Volturi flee .
After leaving the Cullen estate for their cottage , Bella and Edward tuck Renesmee into her bed and proceed to their bedroom arm-in-arm . Bella tells Edward she wants to try something with him . She has been secretly practicing for this moment . Bella places her hands on his cheeks and tries to push away her shield . She conjures her special memories that she wants to share with Edward . He is finally able to see for the first time just how deeply she has always loved him . She wants to remove the barrier for Edward so he can access her mind . She says that they have only forever for her to perfect it . The Twilight series closes with `` And then we continued blissfully into this small but perfect piece of our forever . ''
The cover of Breaking Dawn is a metaphor for Bella 's changes during the entire story . She began as the weakest -LRB- at least physically , when compared to vampires and werewolves -RRB- player on the board : the pawn . She ended as the strongest : the queen .
The title `` Breaking Dawn '' is a reference to the beginning of Bella 's vampire life .
Entertainment Weekly magazine printed a small part of Breaking Dawn on Friday , May 30 , 2008 . Stephenie Meyer also gave a ` Quote of the Day ' from Breaking Dawn for about 3 weeks before the book was released on August 2 , 2008 . The first quote was on Meyer 's website on July 12 , 2008 . The first part of Breaking Dawn , `` Engaged '' , was released in the special edition of Eclipse .
Some readers liked Breaking Dawn but others did not .
In an article on The Daily News Tribute Margaret Smith says of Breaking Dawn `` You too might fall in love with its suspense and moving sensitivity -- and with the unlikely couple struggling to find light within their worldâ s heart of darkness . ''
The Battle of Bosworth or Bosworth Field was an important battle during the Wars of the Roses in 15th century England . It was fought on 22 August , 1485 between the Yorkist King Richard III , the last of the Plantagenet dynasty , and the Lancastrian Henry Tudor , 2nd Earl of Richmond , who wanted to become king . It ended in the defeat and death of Richard and the beginning of the Tudor dynasty . Historically , the battle is considered to have marked the end of the Wars of the Roses , although further battles were fought in the years that followed as Yorkists unsuccessfully tried to become king again .
Decaffeination is a process . It tries to remove most caffeine from things that contain it . Examples for plants that have caffeine in them are coffee beans , mate , tea leaves and cocoa . Soft drinks that do not have caffeine in them are sometimes called decaffeinated . While the caffeine is removed from some of them , it is simply not added to others , like Coca Cola .
There are different processes to remove the caffeine .
Drinks that were produced from plants that had their caffeine removed are not free of caffeine ; they still contain a little . It is simply not possible to remove all caffeine .
The Lord Howe Island stick insect -LRB- Dryococelus australis -RRB- was thought to have died out in 1930 , but more were found in 2001 . It no longer lives in its largest habitat ; Lord Howe Island , and has been called `` the rarest insect in the world '' , because there are less than 30 living today on the small islet of Ball 's Pyramid .
Fingering is the act of touching of the clitoris , vagina , vulva or anus for the purpose of sexual arousal and stimulation with the fingers . It is like the handjob -LRB- manual stimulation of the penis -RRB- . It is a common form of foreplay or mutual masturbation . To `` finger oneself '' is to masturbate in this way .
Digital penetration is penetration -LRB- for example sexual penetration -RRB- , with one or more fingers .
Vaginal fingering can end in orgasm . It also may or may not include the entire sexual encounter . It may be part of foreplay or part of a start to other sexual activities . These activities can provide sexual pleasure to a partner when penetrative intercourse is not possible or desirable for whatever reason .
Fingering of the butt and rectum is commonly enjoyed in preparation for further anal sex . Anal fingering can arouse a person , allowing them to relax their anus and prepare them for the insertion of a penis or a dildo .
The practice is generally considered safe sex as long as the hands are protected with a latex gloves .

The Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit is a street circuit around Albert Park Lake , only a couple of kilometres south of central Melbourne . It is used once a year as a racetrack for the Australian Grand Prix and associated support races .
The circuit uses everyday sections of road that circle Albert Park Lake , a small man-made lake just south of the Central Business District of Melbourne . The roads that are used were rebuilt prior to the first race in 1996 to ensure consistency and smoothness . As a result , the Albert Park track has quite a smooth surface .
The course is considered to be quite fast and relatively easy to drive . Drivers have commented that the consistent placement of corners allows them to easily learn the circuit and achieve competitive times . The flat terrain around the lake , coupled with a track design that features few true straights , means that it is not easy to pass another car on the track . Watching the entire race track can only be done from a grandstand seat .
Each year , most of the trackside fencing , pedestrian overpasses , grandstands and other motorsport infrastructure must be erected for the race . This is done about one month before the Grand Prix weekend . They are all removed by six weeks after the event . Land around the circuit has restricted access during the grand prix weekend . This includes an aquatic center , a golf course , a football stadium , some restaurants and rowing boathouses . Many nearby local residents are unhappy with the loss of park access . Some maintain a silent protest against the event . The event is popular with most people in Melbourne and Australia . They have a large European population and a general interest in motorsport . Middle Park -LRB- stadium -RRB- , the home of South Melbourne FC was demolished in 1994 due to expansion at Albert Park .
Albert Park has the distinction of being the only venue to hold the Australian Grand Prix in both World Championship and non-World Championship formats . Prior to the Grand Prix , a modified version of the current circuit was used for both the 1953 and 1956 Grands Prix . During this time Albert Park ran anti-clockwise as opposed to the current GP circuit standard clockwise .

In cryptography , RC5 is a simple symmetric-key block cipher . Designed by Ronald Rivest in 1994 , RC5 is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size , a variable key size , and a variable number of rounds . `` RC '' stands for `` Rivest Cipher '' , or alternatively , `` Ron 's Code '' .
In order to provide varieties of security and efficiency levels ; RC5 has a variable block size -LRB- 32 , 64 or 128 bits -RRB- , variable key size -LRB- 0 to 2040 bits -RRB- and variable number of rounds -LRB- 0 to 255 -RRB- . The original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of 64 bits , a 128-bit key and 12 rounds .
A key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent rotations ; one of the goals of RC5 was to study and evaluate operations of block ciphers as a cryptographic primitive . RC5 also consists of a number of modular additions and eXclusive OR -LRB- Xor -RRB- s. The general structure of the algorithm is a Feistel-like network . The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code . The key schedule , however , is more complex , expanding the key using an essentially one-way function with the binary expansions of both e and the golden ratio as sources of `` nothing up my sleeve numbers '' . The simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive subject to study by cryptanalysts .
12-round RC5 -LRB- with 64-bit blocks -RRB- is susceptible to a differential attack using 244 chosen plaintexts . 18 -- 20 rounds are suggested as sufficient protection .
RSA Security , which has a patent on the algorithm , offered a series of US$ 10,000 prizes for breaking ciphertexts encrypted with RC5 , but these contests have been discontinued as of May 2007 . A number of these challenge problems have been tackled using distributed computing , organised by Distributed.net . Distributed.net has brute-forced RC5 messages encrypted with 56 - and 64-bit keys , and now is working on cracking a 72-bit key . At the current rate -LRB- as of November 12 , 2008 -RRB- , it will take approximately 1,000 years to test every possible key to complete the project .

In cryptography , RC2 is a symmetric-key block cipher . Designed by Ronald Rivest in 1987 . `` RC '' stands for `` Rivest Cipher '' , or alternatively , `` Ron 's Code '' .
RC2 is a 64-bit block cipher with a variable key size and using 18 rounds .
Rounds are arranged as a source-heavy feistel network , with 16 rounds of one type called `` mixing rounds '' interleaved by two rounds of another type called `` mashing rounds '' .
RC2 uses key-expansion algorithm by which an expanded key consisting of 64 -LRB- 16-bit words -RRB- is produces depending in a complicated way on every bit of the supplied `` variable-length '' input key . A mixing round consists of four applications of the `` mix-up '' transformation , as shown in the diagram . A round is `` mashed '' by adding to it one of the 16-bit words of the expanded key -LRB- RFC 2268 -RRB- .
RC2 is susceptible to a related-key attack using 234 chosen-plaintext attacks -LRB- Kelsey et al , 1997 -RRB- .
Bundala National Park is a protected national park in the south east of Sri Lanka . The area of 6216 hectares was first protected in 1969 . It is an important wetland and was added to the list of Ramsar sites in 1990 . There are many animal species living in the park including elephants and turtles . Because of the wetalnds there are many species of bird which come to the park , including flamingos , pelicans , and storks .
A plug-in hybrid car is similar to a conventional hybrid vehicleâ '' both use a gasoline engine as well as an electric motor . A plug-in hybrid differs primarily in that it can be plugged in to charge the batteries , while a conventional hybrid relies solely on energy generated from braking , coasting or from the gasoline engine .
However , a plug-in hybrid uses larger battery packs that can be recharged by connecting to common household electricity . Plug-in hybrids can be driven for long distancesâ '' from a few miles to as much as 40 milesâ '' without using any gasoline . Plug-in hybrid cars are also known as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles or PHEVs . Plug-in hybrid cars that use a gas engine exclusively for recharging batteriesâ '' rather than directly powering the wheelsâ '' are also called Extended-Range Electric Vehicles or E-REVs .
Fueling your car with electricity is about 5 times cheaper than fueling it with gasoline . That is like buying gasoline at less than $ 1 per gallon . It also reduces your greenhouse pollution and helps reduce crude oil imports . Also plug-in hybrids produced substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions than either conventional gasoline cars or unplugged hybrids . The reduction in emissions results from electric operation being much more efficient than gasoline operation .
Criticisms of the hybrid include the additional cost , weight , and size of a larger battery pack . But The extra weight of the batteries will be offset somewhat by the reduced weight of the gas engine .
It is obvious for most people that internal combustion engine cars can not represent the future anymore because of the oil reserves that are estimated to be finished in forty or fifty years . Obviously , Plug-in vehicles can not be considered a short term option because we lack the needed infrastructure and capable batteries for increasing the autonomy that is currently limited . The general opinion was that , at least for the next seven or eight years , Plug-ins are not going to become the standard in hybrid vehicles and that regular HEVs will have the biggest proportion on the market .

The Seine -LRB- \/ sÉ n \/ in French language -RRB- is a major river of north-western France . It is a commercial way and a tourist attraction , particularly within the city of Paris . The river is 776 km long . It flows into the Atlantic , the English Channel , near Le Havre .
The yo-yo is a popular toy made with of a length of string tied at one end to a flat spool . It is used by holding the free end of the string -LRB- usually by inserting one finger in a slip knot -RRB- and pulling at it so as to cause the spool to turn while it is hanging in mid-air , either winding or unwinding the string . It first became popular in the 1920s .
In the simplest play , the string is wound on the spool by hand . The yo-yo is then thrown downwards , so that it goes down and unwinds the string . It then -LRB- by inertia -RRB- climbs back , winding the stringt up . Finally the yo-yo is grabbed , ready to be thrown again . Many other trick plays exist , most based on the basic `` sleeper '' trick . One of the most famous tricks on the yoyo is `` walk the dog '' . This is done by throwing a strong sleeper and allowing the yoyo to roll across the floor .
English historical names for the yo-yo include bandalore -LRB- from French -RRB- and quiz . French historical terms include bandalore , incroyable , de Coblenz , emigrette , and joujou de Normandie -LRB- joujou meaning little toy -RRB- .
The earliest surviving yo-yo dates to 500 BC and was made using terra cotta -LCB- clay -RRB- disks . A Greek vase painting from this date shows a boy playing yo-yo -LRB- see right -RRB- . Greek records from this time describe toys made out of wood , metal , or painted terra cotta . The terra cotta disks were used to ceremonially offer the toys of youth to certain gods when a child came of age . Disks of other materials were used for actual play .
Philippine historical records show that 16th century hunters hiding in trees used a rock tied to a string up to 20 feet in length to throw at wild animals beneath them . The string meant they could get the rock back without having to come down from the tree .
Convergent evolution is a process in biology . It occurs when two species from unrelated lines develop the same traits or features . This happens because they live in similar habitats , and have to develop solutions to the same kind of problems .
Similarity in traits can occur in two ways . Both species might have acquired the trait by descent from a common ancestor . In this case the structures are homologous . An example is the tetrapod limb , which has been inherited from early tetrapods in the late Devonian\/early Carboniferous , about 360 million years ago . On the other hand , both might be independent adaptations to similar conditions in their habitat . In this case the structures are analogous . Convergent evolution leads to analogous features .
Examples of convergent evolution are extremely numerous : it is an important feature of evolution . See : en : List of examples of convergent evolution
Parallelophyly is the special case where two or more lines with a close common ancestor acquire the same character independently . Cichlid fish in Lake Tanganyika in East Africa have developed the same feeding method in six different lines . Stalked eyes on occur irregularly and independently in acalypteran flies , which have clearly inherited the genetic capacity for such eyes . This capacity is selected only in some lines . p62 , 225

Piracy is a crime that people do on ships which are at sea . Pirate is the name given to those people . They usually have small and fast boats . They use these boats to attack other ships , which are usually large cargo ships .
For as long as ships have sailed the sea , there have been pirates . From the Greeks , to the Romans , to the Middle Ages , to the British Empire , there have always been pirates .
Modern-day pirates usually climb onto ships to get money . In the process , they may kill the crew , or hold them for ransom . In a very few cases , they may also take over the ship and sell its cargo .
The cargo ships that travel the oceans are huge . They usually have very few crew members . -LRB- Crew is the name for all the people who work on a boat . -RRB- Since the ships are so big , they often carry a lot of money in the ship 's safe . This money is used to pay the crew , and to pay for the taxes to stay at a port , or to pass through a channel .

Saint-Marcel-l Ã s-Annonay is a commune in the ArdÃ che dÃ partement in southern France .
The area was settled in 972 . The DeÃ '' me passes through Saint-Marcel and flows into the Cance with Annonay . Water from these rivers comes from the granitic areas and is very pure . Their patent rights have been recognized for several centuries with the rise of paper mills . The paper mills of Annonay by Montgolfier-Canson formed only two groups in the 18th century from Vidalon and Faya .
In 1805 , Jean-Baptiste de Montgolfier was detached from Vidalon to create a factory in Saint-Marcel . Paper production was a large contributor to the rise of the commune and was the main industry for a long period of time . The employees of paper mills were called les usines , French for factory , and formed the integral part of their culture and life .
The small commune formed only industrial and is residential today , the picturesque buildings mixed with modern buildings .

RagÃ alla bolognese , or Bolognese sauce -LRB- in French sauce bolognaise -RRB- is a meat-based sauce for pasta . The sauce came from Bologna , Italy . Bolognese sauce is sometimes taken to be a tomato sauce but authentic recipes have only a small amount of tomato .
The people of Bologna traditionally serve their famous ragÃ with freshly made tagliatelle -LRB- tagliatelle alla bolognese -RRB- and their traditionally green lasagne . Less traditionally , the sauce is served with maccheroni or other durum wheat short pasta .
In 1982 , the Bolognese delegation of Accademia Italiana della Cucina said that the recipe may only contain beef , pancetta , onions , carrots , celery , tomato paste , meat broth , red wine , and -LRB- optionally -RRB- milk or cream . There are different recipes , some traditional ones also contain chopped pork or pork sausage . For special occasions , chicken or goose liver , along with veal . Today , both butter and olive oil are used for cooking the Soffritto of small amounts of celery , carrot and onion . When they are available , Prosciutto , mortadella , or porcini fresh mushrooms may be added as well . Milk may be used , especially when starting to cook the meat . This will make the taste better . It is not unsual to cook the RagÃ for a long time , 5 to 6 hours are common .
Spaghetti alla Bolognese , Spaghetti Bolognese , or Spaghetti Bolognaise in a form popular outside of Italy , consists of a meat sauce served on a bed of spaghetti with a good sprinkling of grated Parmigiano cheese . Although Spaghetti alla Bolognese are very popular outside of Italy , it never existed in Bologna , where ragÃ is served always with the local egg pastas tagliatelle or lasagne . Spaghetti is a durum wheat pasta from Naples , and the Naples RagÃ of a meat flavored thick tomato sauce clings much better to slippery spaghetti than Bologna 's ground beef ragÃ .
In recent decades , the dish has become very popular in Sweden and Denmark as , in Swedish , and ' in Danish , especially among children . It is also popular in the United Kingdom -LRB- where it is colloquially abbreviated to spag bol or spag bog -RRB- and has become a staple of the British dinner table . In the United States as well , the term ` bolognese ' is often applied to a tomato-and-ground-beef sauce that bears little resemblance to ragÃ served in Bologna .
Chinese people often use the term `` Western zhajiang mian '' to refer to spaghetti bolognese , alluding to its superficial similarities with the traditional Chinese noodle dish of zhajiang mian as both are dry noodles covered with a thick ragÃ mainly made of minced meat . This provides an interesting symmetrical perspective to Westerners referring to zhajiang mian as `` Chinese spaghetti '' .
Everton Football Club or Everton F.C. are an English football club from the city of Liverpool . The club currently competes in the Premier League and have played more seasons in the top league of English football than any other team .
Everton were founded in 1878 . They have a long rivalry with Liverpool , whose ground is nearby . When they play each other the match known as a Merseyside derby . In the 1890 's Everton played at Anfield , Liverpool 's stadium . But the owner of the stadium put the rent up so much the club decided to leave and build their own instead . Everton were then based at a new stadium called Goodison Park . They still play there today .
Many famous players have played at Everton including the English World Cup winning Alan Ball and legendary goal scorer William ` Dixie ' Dean . Dean still holds the record for most goals in one season scoring 60 in the 1927\/1928 season .
Everton started out in 1878 with the name St Domingo 's FC . At first it was only for people who went to St Domingo 's church , but so many people were interested they let people from the local are join as well . A year later the club was renamed Everton Football Club , after the area . Everton Football Club 's first ever match was against a team called St Peter 's in 1879 . Everton won 6-0 .
Everton entered the FA Cup in the 1886\/87 season . They were beaten 1-0 by Rangers in the first round . As football became more and more popular around England , the clubs realized they needed an organised league . In 1888 the Football League was founded . Everton were one of the 12 founding members . Preston North End won the first two leagues and Everton won the third in 1891 . They won their second ever trophy , the FA Cup , in 1905 but did not win another until 1916 . It was not until 1927 that Everton had their first period of long success . In 1925 they signed Dixie Dean and in 1927 he scored 60 goals in 39 games , setting a new world record and taking Everton to another league title . Everton were relegated , or sent down , to a the second division in 1930\/1931 . Within a year they were promoted again , and the club has not been relegated again since and in doing so created an English football record for the most seasons by a club in the top tier of English football
Everton 's second successful period came after 1961 when Harry Catterick was given the job of manager . With Catterick in charge Everton won two league titles and four cups between 1961 and 1970 . This success did not last however , and after three years of low league finishes Catterick quit his job . The club finished in middle of the table , mid-table , positions for the rest of the 1970 's with a line of not very good managers . In 1981 the club appointed Howard Kendall to be the new manager . He turned Everton around and eventually became the most successful manager in the clubs history , winning two league titles and three cups between 1981 and 1987 . This era also brought Everton 's one and only European trophy win , the Cup Winners Cup in 1985 . The semi final saw Everton beat German champions Bayern Munich 3-1 , a match voted the greatest of all time at Goodison Park . The final saw the same result against Rapid Vienna , crowning Everton European Cup Winners Cup Champions for their first and only european title to date .
In 1987 several Liverpool and 39 Juventus fans died when the crowd started fighting at a stadium in Heysel , Germany . UEFA decided that Liverpool fans were mainly to blame . Because of this all English clubs were not allowed to play against European teams untl 1991 . This denied Everton the chance to defend their European title and the team gradually broke up , selling many of their best players to other European clubs . The club did not do very well in the early 90s , nearly getting relegated twice and going through lots of money problems . However they still became one of the first members of the new English Premier League when it started in 1992 . They were quite successful under a manager called Joe Royle , who took over in 1994 . In his second season in charge he kept Everton clear of relegation and won the FA cup , the clubs first trophy in seven years . The club had steady improvement under Royle , finishing 6th and 7th in the 1996 and 1997 seasons .
After two seasons however the clubs performance went downhill and Kendall was sacked after only narrowly avoiding relegation in the 1998\/199 season . Former player Walter Smith took over for three reasons , but failed to perform , spending a lot of money but not getting the team to good league positions . David Moyes took over in 2002 and has been one of the clubs most successful managers to date . Under his management the club has become a regular top 10 side , finishing 4th in 2005 , their highest ever Premier League finish .
Under his management Wayne Rooney was brought into the first team and he was quickly sold to Manchester United for Â # 27 million , a club record fee . Since 2005 Everton have enjoyed regular top 8 finishes and reached the last 16 of the UEFA Cup in 2007 and the FA Cup final in 2009 .
Everton usually wear royal blue shirts with white shorts and blue socks .
They wore many different kit colors in their first few years . At first they wore white shorts and white shirts with blue stripes . However many players who moved to Everton still wore the shirts of their old team , so things quickly got confusing . To solve this the club introduced an all black kit to the club , as black dye was cheap and easily available . However many fans thought this was quite boring and slightly morbid so a red band was added across the chest . It was not until the 1901\/02 season that the colors of royal blue and white were first introduced . This kit has stayed , with a few small changes , almost exactly the same from then until the present day . It was changed for one year in 1986 , to light blue , but the fans did not like this at all and it was quickly changed back again .
Everton 's current shirt sponsor is a beer maker from Thailand , Chang Beer . Previous shirt sponsors have included electronics company NEC and food maker Danka . Everton were the first Premier League team to take off shirt sponsors from their child shirts because they did not like advertising alcohol to children .
Everton 's nickname is the Toffees , or sometimes the Toffeemen . This comes from one of two toffee shops that were near their stadium at the time the club started . Both Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House and Old Mother Nobletts Toffee Shop claim to have started off the nickname . At first Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House was very popular with fans because it was near to their stadium . However when the club moved to Goodison Park , they became close to Old Mother Nobletts Toffee Shop . There they sold sweets called ` Everton mints ' , which proved even more popular . Faced with going out of business , Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House got a licence to throw free toffees to the crowd inside the ground , before the match . This tradition continues even today . A teenage girl is chosen from the crowd to throw toffees to the crowd before the match , at half time and after the match .
At other times in their history Everton have also been known as ` The Black Watch ' , ` The Blues ' and , in the 1980 's , ` The School of Science ' .
Like many Premier League football clubs , Everton 's players walk out onto the pitch to a particular song at the beginning of every match . With Everton it is the theme tune to a 1960 's television series called Z-Cars . Z-Cars was about police working in a made up town , which many people believed was based on real life Liverpool .

Acinos is a genus of ten species of annual and short-lived evergreen perennial woody plants native to southern Europe and western Asia . Its name comes from the Greek word akinos , the name of a small aromatic plant . They are small , tufted , bushy or spreading plants growing to 10-45 cm tall . The 2-lipped , tubular flowers are borne on erect sprikes in mid-summer .
`` Sumer Is Icumen In '' is a very old English song which can be sung as a round . It is the oldest example of a round that we know of . The composer is unknown . It was written down around the middle of the 13th century by a monk but we do not know whether that monk composed it , or whether it had been composed earlier .
The title means `` Summer has come in '' . The round can be sung in six parts . There are also two parts which can be repeated again and again -LRB- an ostinato -RRB- throughout the piece . The language is Middle English and is based on the dialect spoken in Wessex , England at the time .
To sing as a round , one singer -LRB- or group of singers -RRB- would begin at the beginning , a second singer would start at the beginning as the first got to the point marked with the red cross , then the third would join in when the second singer got to the red cross , and so on until all six were singing . The repeated pattern is marked `` Pes '' . The instructions are written in Latin .

In Statistics , Type I and type II errors are errors that happen when a coincidence occurs while doing statistics , which gives you a wrong conclusion . A Type I error is saying the original question is false , when it is actually true . A Type II error is saying the original question is true , when it is actually false .
In physics , an elementary particle is a particle not made up of smaller particles . Elementary particles are either bosons or fermions . The Standard Model is the best known way to explain how all particles behave , and the forces that affect these particles .
Atoms are not elementary particles because they are made of protons and neutrons joined together . Protons and neutrons are not elementary particles because they are made up of quarks joined together . Quarks are elementary because quarks can not be broken down any further . Every elementary particle has three important properties . Each property has a number value . The properties are :
Mass and charge are properties we can see in everyday life , because gravity and electricity affect things that humans can see and touch . On the other hand , spin is not a property that affects what we see in everyday life . Fermions have a spin number of 1\/2 , and are either quarks or leptons . There are 12 different types of fermions . Each type is called a `` flavor . '' The flavors are :
Six of the 12 fermions last forever : up , down , electron , and the three kinds of neutrinos . The other fermions decay . That is , they break down into other particles a fraction of a second after they are created . Fermi-Dirac statistics is a theory that describes how collections of fermions behave . The word `` fermion '' honors the physicist Enrico Fermi . Bosons have spin numbers that are integers -LRB- 1 , 2 , etc. . These are actually natural numbers . -RRB- There are two kinds of bosons :
The photon and the gluons have no charge , and are the only elementary particles that have a mass of 0 for certain . The photon is the only boson that does not decay . Bose-Einstein statistics is a theory that describes how collections of bosons behave . The word `` boson '' honors the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose -LRB- 1894-1974 -RRB- .
The Standard Model includes all of the elementary particles described above . All these particles except the Higgs boson have been observed in nature or in the laboratory .
The Standard Model does not talk about gravity . If gravity works like the three other fundamental forces , then gravity is carried by boson called the graviton . -LRB- The Higgs boson and graviton have yet to be found , and are not included in the table above . -RRB-
The first fermion to be discovered , and the one we know the most about , is the electron . The first boson to be discovered , and also the one we know the most about , is the photon . The theory that explains very accurately how the electron , photon , electromagnetism , and electromagnetic radiation all work together is called quantum electrodynamics .
Christian apologetics is a field of Christian theology that tries to find a rational basis for the Christian faith . There have been many people who tried to do this , including Paul of Tarsus , Origen , Augustine of Hippo and C. S. Lewis . Apologists base their arguments on historical evidence and philosophy , amongst others .

Lionel Richie -LRB- born June 20 , 1949 -RRB- is a popular American pop singer , most famous for his 1980s songs . Richie started his career with The Commodores ; between him and the band , Three Times a Lady is their best remembered effort .
His self-titled debut album was one of the biggest music successes of 1982 . More successful was its follow-up , Ca n't Slow Down .
In 1984 , as a surprise guest , he sang All Night Long to a worldwide audience of over two billion at the Los Angeles Summer Olympics .
In 1990 , three years after he retired , Richie adopted Nicole Escovedo . Now Nicole Richie , she has recently appeared on Fox 's The Simple Life along with Paris Hilton .
The singer returned to the music industry in 1996 with Louder than Words . Another album of his , Renaissance , came out four years later .
An interval in music means the distance between two notes -LRB- whether these notes are played together or separately -RRB- .
Two notes on a keyboard which are next to one another -LRB- counting both white and black notes -RRB- are a â semitoneâ apart . A â toneâ is two semitones -LRB- see semitone -RRB- . However , an â intervalâ depends on how the notes are written -LRB- what they are called -RRB- e.g. whether the black note between D and E is written as D sharp or E flat -LRB- which are two different names for the same note -RRB- .
In a major scale there are eight notes e.g. a C major scale -LRB- see above -RRB- is : C D E F G A B C and down again .
-LRB- this is always so long as the letter name has not changed -RRB- .
It is important to realize that , in order to work out what an interval is , the lower note should be treated as the first note of the scale .
Intervals can be â invertedâ -LRB- turned upside down -RRB- . For example : instead of going from a C up to an A -LRB- major 6th -RRB- we can go from C down to an A -LRB- minor 3rd -RRB- .
Compound intervals are intervals bigger than an octave e.g. C to D an octave and one more note above it is a major 9th .
Big intervals are called â wideâ intervals . The opposite is a â narrowâ interval .

C-type asteroids are asteroids made of carbonates . They are the most common variety taking up around 75 % of known asteroids , and an even higher percentage in the farther part of the belt beyond 2.7 AU , which is dominated by this asteroid type . The amount of C-types may actually be higher than this , because C-types are much darker than most other asteroid types except D-types and others common only at the extreme farther edge of the Main Belt .
This type of asteroid has very similar spectra to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites -LRB- types CI and CM -RRB- , whose chemical make-up is about the same as the Sun and the primitive solar nebula , except that they do not contain hydrogen , helium and other volatiles . Hydrated -LRB- water-containing -RRB- minerals are present .
C-type asteroids are very dark with albedos usually in the 0.03 to 0.10 range . Consequently , whereas a number of S-types can normally be viewed with binoculars at opposition , even the biggest C-types require a small telescope . The potentially brightest C-type asteroid is 324 Bamberga , but that object 's very high eccentricity means it rarely reaches its maximum magnitude .
Their spectra contain moderately strong ultraviolet absorption at wavelengths below about 0.4 Î 1\/4 m to 0.5 Î 1\/4 m , while at longer wavelengths they are very featureless but slightly reddish . The so-called `` water '' absorption feature around 3 Î 1\/4 m , which can be a sign of water content in minerals is also present .
The biggest unequivocally C-type asteroid is 10 Hygiea , although the SMASS classification places the biggest asteroid 1 Ceres , here as well , because that scheme lacks a G-type .
Freemasonry is an organization of people who believe in brotherhood and helping others . Its members are known as `` Freemasons '' -LRB- in full : `` Ancient Free and Accepted Masons '' , or simply `` Masons '' -RRB- . Freemasons also help one another in times of hardship . Freemasonry can be found all over the world in various forms . About 6 million people are Freemasons .
The local groups in various countries are known as `` lodges '' . At the State or National level are `` Grand Lodges '' . These are independent of each other . `` Regular '' Freemasonry is only for men , but there are also co-ed Masonic lodges -LRB- and lodges for only Women -RRB- that are not recognized as legitimate by the `` regular '' groups . All of these lodges believe in `` brotherly love , relief and truth '' . They do work for charities such as running schools for orphaned children . There is a Royal Masonic Hospital which is a home for old members and their families .
The word mason means a man who works with stone . He is also called a `` stonemason '' . Freemasonry grew from the groups -LRB- guilds -RRB- of stonemasons in the middle ages . These men were building cathedrals and other big buildings . They were called freemasons because they were free , they were not servants who belonged to a rich lord , like many workers were in those days . They often changed jobs and moved about from one town to another . In this way they were different from other craftsmen who often worked in one place and had guilds in one town . The stonemasons tried to keep their skills secret so that only they knew how to do their job . This is probably why the Freemasons have hand shakes and passwords that they swear to keep secret .
About 1650 masons ' guilds started to let people who were not masons into their guilds . In 1717 the first Grand Lodge -LRB- the Grand Lodge of England -RRB- was formed . It developed into the governing body of Freemasonry in England . In 1813 it merged with a rival and is now called the United Grand Lodge of England .

`` Girlfriend '' is a song by Avril Lavigne . It was the lead single from her third album , The Best Damn Thing -LRB- 2007 -RRB- . It was produced by Lukasz `` Dr. Luke '' Gottwald . `` Girlfriend '' became Lavigne 's biggest hit in the United States , where it reached number one on the U.S. Hot 100 , in Australia , where it topped the chart , and in the United Kingdom , where it reached number two . A remix version featuring singer Lil ' Mama was released in June 2007 .
`` Girlfriend '' was the subject of a lawsuit filed by songwriters for The Rubinoos , who alleged that the writers of the song copied The Rubinos ' single `` I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend '' . Only one line , not even of the same tune was : `` Hey , hey , you , you ! I want to be your girlfriend ! '' Note it was `` I want to '' not `` I wanna '' .

The Great Barrier Reef is the world 's largest coral reef . It is located close to the coast of Queensland , Australia . It is 2,300 km long . It is made up of nearly 3000 coral reefs and over 600 islands . It has been listed an important World Heritage Site by UNESCO . The Great Barrier Reef is the largest structure made by living things . It can be seen from outer space .
James Cook discovered the reef by accident on 11 June 1770 , when his ship , the `` Endeavour '' , crashed into it . The coral ripped a large hole in the bottom of his ship . Cook and the crew were able to keep the ship from sinking . They were able to get the ship onto a beach at what is now called Cooktown . His crew took seven weeks to repair the ship and continue the voyage .
The Reef Research Centre has found the remains of coral that are half a million years old . Corals have been growing in the region for as long as 25 million years . The corals have not always formed coral reefs .
It is difficult to work out the age of the Great Barrier Reef . This is because of the way a reef can grow and shrink as the sea level changes . A coral reef can grow in diameter , that is how wide they are , from 1 to 2 cm per year . They can also grow upwards from 1 to 15 cm per year . Coral can not grow if the water is too deep -LRB- 150 metres or more -RRB- because it needs light from the sun . They can not grow out of the water -LRB- above sea level -RRB- .
The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and Australian Institute of Marine Science say the current , living reef started growing about 20,000 years ago . It started to grow on an older reef . This makes the beginning of the reef during the Last Glacial Maximum . At that time , the sea level was 120 metres lower than it is today . The land that forms the bottom of the Great Barrier Reef was a coastal plain . The plain had some large hills . Some of these hills were parts of older reefs .
From 20,000 years ago until 6,000 years the sea level began to rise . As it rose , the corals could grow higher on the hills of the coastal plain . By 13,000 years ago the sea level was 60 metres lower than the present day . Corals began to grow around the hills of the coastal plain . These became continental islands . As the sea level rose higher , most of these continental islands were covered by water . The corals could then grow over the hills . This formed the present cays and reefs . Sea level on the Great Barrier Reef has not risen much in the last 6,000 years . The CRC Reef Research Centre has worked out that the present , living reef is 6,000 to 8,000 years old .
The remains of a very old barrier reef has been found in the Kimberley area . This is in the northern part of Western Australia .
The Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area has been divided into 70 different areas . These are called bioregions . Each bioregion has its own special plants and animals . There are 30 reef bioregions , and 40 are non-reef bioregions . In the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef , there are ribbon reefs and deltaic reefs . These kinds of reef are not found in the rest of the Great Barrier Reef system .
The Great Barrier Reef has 14000 different plants and animals . This includes many vulnerable or endangered species . Some of these can only be found on this reef system .
Thirty species of whales , dolphins , and porpoises have been seen in the Great Barrier Reef . This includes the dwarf minke whale , Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin , and the humpback whale . Most of the population of the dugongs live there .
Six species of sea turtles come to the reef to breed . These are the green sea turtle , leatherback sea turtle , hawksbill turtle , loggerhead sea turtle , flatback turtle , and the olive ridley . There are two different groups of green sea turtles on the Great Barrier Reef . One group lives in the northern part of the reef and the other in the south . Fifteen species of seagrass attract the dugongs and turtles . They also provide a food and shelter for fish . The most common kinds of seagrasses are Halophila and Halodule .
Saltwater Crocodiles live in mangrove and salt marshes on the coast near the reef . No crocodile nests have been found on the reef . The salt water crocodiles on the reef travel long distances . There are not many living around the reef . Around 125 species of shark , stingray , skates or chimera live on the reef . About 5,000 species of mollusc have been found on the reef . These include the giant clam , nudibranchs and cone snails . Forty-nine species of pipefish and nine species of seahorse have been found . Seven species of frogs have be found on the islands .
215 species of birds come to the reef or nest or roost on the islands . This includes 22 species of seabirds and 32 species of shorebirds . These include the white-bellied sea eagle and roseate tern . Most nesting sites are on islands in the northern and southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef . About 1.7 million birds use the sites to breed .
The islands of the Great Barrier Reef also have 2,195 known plant species . Three of these are not found anywhere else . The northern islands have 300-350 plants which are woody . The southern islands have 200 plants which are herbaceous . The Whitsunday region has the most -LRB- 1,141 -RRB- plant speciess . The plant species are spread by birds .
Seventeen types of sea snake live on the Great Barrier Reef . They take about 4 years to become old enough to breed . They usually live on the sea floor . They live in warm waters up to deep . They are more common in the southern part of the reef .
More than 1,500 species of fish live on the reef . These include the clownfish , red bass , red-throat emperor , and several types of snapper and coral trout . There are at least 330 species of sea squirts -LRB- ascidians -RRB- found on the reef . These vary in size from 1 mm-10 cm in diameter . Between 300-500 species of bryozoans are found on the reef system . These are small water animals that look like moss , or branches .
Four hundred species of corals , both hard corals and soft corals are found on the reef . Most of these spawn , releasing thousands of eggs , in huge events . This spawning is controlled by the rising sea temperatures . This happens in spring and summer , as part of the moons lunar cycle , and the day\/night diurnal cycle . Reefs in the inner Great Barrier Reef spawn during the week after the full moon in October . Outer reefs spawn in November and December . The common soft corals on the Great Barrier Reef belong to 36 different types . Five hundred species of marine algae or seaweed live on the reef . This includes thirteen types of Halimeda . These deposit chalky -LRB- calcareous -RRB- mounds up to 100 metres wide . They have mini-ecosystems on their surface which have been compared to rainforest cover .
A new report , the Reef Outlook Report , says that climate change will cause huge damage to the reef . The report was written by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority . Warmer and more acidic water around the coral reef will slow down calcification , which is how the coral grows and becomes strong . The corals will become bleached -LRB- lose their colors -RRB- and many species that live on and around the reef will be in danger . The Australian government has already spent AU$ 325 million to improve the health of the reef in the last two years .
The Reef Outlook Report also warned of other dangers to the reef . These included poor quality water running into the sea from the mainland . This water is polluted with farm insecticides and rubbish from nearby towns . The increasing amount of development on the coast is destroying natural marine and coastal habitats . There is also some damage from fishing .
An Axel jump is a jump in figure skating . It is the most famous and recognizable skating jump . It starts with the skater going forward . It is the only jump that does and that helps people know that the jump is an Axel jump . Because all skating jumps are landed going backwards , the Axel jump has an extra half rotation -LRB- full circle -RRB- in the air than all other skating jumps .
The jump was named after Axel Paulsen of Norway , who invented the jump .
The first skater to do a double Axel in competition was Dick Button and Carol Heiss Jenkins was the first woman to do it . The first skater to do a triple Axel in competition was Vern Taylor . The first woman to do it was Midori Ito .
The first pairs skater to do a throw triple Axel -LRB- he helps her with the jump -RRB- were Rena Inoue & John Baldwin . It is not known who did the first throw double Axel .
The Axel can be a single Axel -LRB- 1 and a half rotations in the air -RRB- , a double Axel -LRB- two and a half rotations in the air -RRB- , or a triple Axel -LRB- three and a half rotations in the air -RRB- . Most Junior and Senior skaters do a double Axel . Many senior-level male skaters do a triple Axel . Only six female figure skaters have been credited with doing the triple Axel in competition : Midori Ito -LRB- the first one to do it -RRB- , Tonya Harding , Yukari Nakano , Ludmila Nelidina , Mao Asada , and Kimmie Meissner .
Because the Axel is the most famous skating jump , many people make a mistake and call all skating jumps as Axel jumps . This has led to many mistakes in sports reporting of figure skating , for example a report in 2006 saying that Miki Ando was the first woman to do a quadruple Axel jump . No one has yet done a quadruple Axel jump . Ando did the first quadruple Salchow , which is a different jump .

Fuel oil is a fraction obtained from petroleum distillation , either as a distillate or a residue .
Broadly speaking , fuel oil is any liquid petroleum product that is burned in a furnace or boiler for the generation of heat or used in an engine for the generation of power , except oils having a flash point of approximately +40 Â C and oils burned in cotton or wool-wick burners . In this sense , diesel is a type of fuel oil . Fuel oil is made of long hydrocarbon chains , particularly alkanes , cycloalkanes and aromatics . The term fuel oil is also used in a stricter sense to refer only to the heaviest commercial fuel that can be obtained from crude oil , heavier than gasoline and naphtha .
Fuel oil in the United States is classified into six classes , according to its boiling temperature , composition and purpose . The boiling point , ranging from 175 to 600 Â C , and carbon chain length , 20 to 70 atoms , of the fuel increases with number . Viscosity also increases with fuel oil number and the heaviest oil has to be heated to get it to flow . Price usually decreases as the fuel number increases . No. 1 fuel oil , No. 2 fuel oil -LRB- heating oil -RRB- , and No. 3 fuel oil are referred to as distillate fuel oils , diesel fuel oils , light fuel oils , gasoil or just distillate . For example , No. 2 fuel oil , No. 2 distillate and No. 2 diesel fuel oil are almost the same thing . Diesel is different in that it also has a cetane number limit which describes the ignition quality of the fuel . Distillate fuel oils are distilled from crude oil .

Great Zimbabwe is an important place in Africa . Hundreds of years ago it was a big city . It was the capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe . This kingdom included the River Zambezi in the north , the Transvaal in the south and Botswana in the east .
The people who lived at Great Zimbabwe were rich merchants who controlled trade between the coast and inland Africa . The modern country of Zimbabwe is named after Great Zimbabwe . In English the city 's name means ` the great city built of stones ' .
Between 12,000 and 20,000 people lived at Great Zimbabwe . About 1000 years ago they began to build their town in stone . Archaeologists have found goods from as far as China that were used by the people . This shows they bought and sold things over great distances . The city covered 720 hectares but had stopped growing when traders from Portugal came to southern Africa 500 years ago . Nobody is sure why Great Zimbabwe was stopped . It could have been due to drought or sickness .
Europeans at first thought that Great Zimbabwe had been built by foreigners . Now we know it was built by the local people . People who have studied the site have learned much about old Africa .
Great Zimbabwe has been made a World Heritage Site because it is so big and important . The walls of the city are the biggest stone structure made by man , after the Pyramids at Giza .

Simply speaking , momentum of an object -LRB- p -RRB- is defined as the product of the mass -LRB- m -RRB- and velocity -LRB- v -RRB- of the object . It is a vector quantity , which has both direction and magnitude . Its unit is kg m\/s -LRB- kilogram metre per second -RRB- or N s -LRB- newton second -RRB- . Momentum is sometimes referred to as linear momentum which is different from its related subject angular momentum .
Momentum is a conserved object , meaning that the total initial momentum of a system must be equal to the total final momentum of a system . Total amount of momentum remains unchanged .
Momentum can be considered the `` power '' when an object is moving , meaning how much force it can have on another object . For example , a bowling ball -LRB- large mass -RRB- pushed very slowly -LRB- low velocity -RRB- can hit a glass door and not break it , while a baseball -LRB- small mass -RRB- can be thrown fast -LRB- high velocity -RRB- and break the same window . The baseball has a larger momentum than the bowling ball . Because momentum is the product of the mass and the velocity of an object , that both mass and velocity affect the momentum of an object . As shown , an object with a large mass and low velocity can have the same momentum as an object with a small mass and large velocity .
where p is the momentum , m is the mass and v is the velocity .
The meaning is that the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change in momentum of the object .
This equation also applies in special relativity , but with m being the relativistic mass of the object .
In understanding conservation of momentum , the direction of the momentum is important . Momentum in a system is added up using vector addition . Under the rules of vector addition , adding a certain amount of momentum together with the same amount of momentum going in the opposite direction gives a total momentum of zero .
For instance , when a gun is fired , a small mass -LRB- the bullet -RRB- moves at a high speed in one direction . A larger mass -LRB- the gun -RRB- moves in the opposite direction at a much slower speed . The momentum of the bullet and the momentum of the gun are exactly equal in size but opposite in direction . Using vector addition to add the momentum of the bullet to the momentum of the gun -LRB- equal in size but opposite in direction -RRB- gives a total system momentum of zero . The momentum of the gun-bullet system has been conserved .

Robert `` Bobby '' Lee Dodd -LRB- November 11 , 1908 -- June 21 , 1988 -RRB- was an American college football coach at Georgia Institute of Technology -LRB- Georgia Tech -RRB- . He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player and coach . He is one of only three people to have done this .
Dodd was born in Galax , Virginia . He moved to Kingsport , Tennessee and played several sports at Dobyns-Bennett High School . After high school , he played as a quarterback at the University of Tennessee . From 1931 â `` 1945 , he worked as an assistant coach for William Alexander at Georgia Tech . Alexander hired Dodd while he was still a student at Tennessee . Dodd replaced Alexander in 1945 and became the third head coach at Georgia Tech . He retired from coaching after the 1966 -- 67 season , with 165 wins , 64 losses , and 8 ties in his career . He also worked as athletic director for Georgia Tech from 1950 until 1976 . Dodd died in June 1988 at the age of 79 in Atlanta , Georgia .
Dodd was quarterback for the University of Tennessee football team from 1928 to 1930 . He played for its coach , Robert Neyland . Dodd wanted to play for Georgia Tech but was not offered a scholarship . In the games that Dodd started at Tennessee , they had a record of 27 -- 1 -- 2 .
Dodd played a major role in one famous game . During his sophomore year , in a game against Alabama , `` Dodd threw a touchdown pass in that game to tie Alabama , 13 -- 13 . Then he punted out of bounds inside the Alabama 1-yard line and Tennessee got a safety on the next play to win , 15 -- 13 . '' This was an important game for both teams since they were rivals .
Another time in Dodd 's playing career showed the thinking he would use in his coaching career . `` Against Florida in 1930 he got his teammates in a huddle and told them about a play he had used in high school . When the ball was snapped , it was placed on the ground unattended . The players ran in one direction . Then the center returned , picked up the ball , and waltzed to the winning touchdown . '' Tennessee fans even developed a catch phrase for Dodd during his time there : `` In Dodd we trust . ''
Dodd was selected to be on Grantland Rice 's All-American team in 1930 . He was the second player from Tennessee to make an All American team . The first was Gene McEver in 1929 . In 1959 , Dodd was selected for the University of Tennessee 's Hall of Fame and to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player . He was elected in the same year as teammate Herman Hickman .
Dodd had a 165 -- 64 -- 8 record as head coach at Georgia Tech . He led Georgia Tech to two Southeastern Conference -LRB- SEC -RRB- championships -LRB- 1951 and 1952 -RRB- and one national championship in 1952 . While he was coach , Tech played in 13 major bowl games . The school won 9 of these games , including six in a row from 1951 to 1956 . His team had a 31-game winning streak from 1951 to 1953 .
Dodd took over the Georgia Tech football program after Coach Alexander 's retirement in 1944 . Dodd 's coaching ideas were about developing and treating his players well . He did not believe in hard physical practices . Instead , he liked practices that were about the small details of football . Dodd 's ideas led to winning . He set the record for career wins at Tech at 165 career coaching wins including a 31-game winning streak from 1951 -- 1953 . He also won two Southeastern Conference Titles and the 1952 National Title . The 1952 title was part of a 12 -- 0 perfect season and Sugar Bowl win over Ole Miss.
Dodd also understood the rivalry with the University of Georgia . His teams won 8 games in a row over the Bulldogs from 1946 -- 1954 . They had 176 points to Georgia 's 39 during the winning streak . This 8 â `` game winning streak is still the longest winning streak for either side in the series . Dodd ended his career with a 12 -- 9 record against Georgia .
Dodd 's career included Georgia Tech leaving the Southeastern Conference . The initial reason for them leaving was a feud between Dodd and Alabama Crimson Tide Coach Bear Bryant . The feud began when Tech was visiting the Tide at Denny Stadium in 1961 . After a Georgia Tech punt , Alabama fair-caught the ball . Chick Granning of Georgia Tech was running down to tackle the receiver of the punt , but relaxed after the signal for the fair catch . Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and hit his elbow into Granning 's face . This caused severe breaks in Granning 's face , a broken nose , and blood-filled sinuses . Granning became unconscious and suffered a severe concussion . These injuries left him unable to play football ever again . Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt . Dodd felt that Holt injured Granning on purpose . Bryant never suspended Holt . The lack of punishment made Dodd angry and caused him to want to leave the SEC .
Another issue for Dodd was Alabama 's and other SEC schools ' recruiting of players . Schools would recruit more players than they could have on their roster . During the summer practice sessions , the teams would remove extra players . This would happen after the signing day which meant those players could not find somewhere else to play . Dodd asked the SEC leaders to punish the `` tryout camps '' of other SEC members but the SEC did not . Finally , Dodd took Georgia Tech out of the SEC in 1963 . Tech would play without a league like Notre Dame and Penn State -LRB- at the time -RRB- during the final four years of Dodd 's coaching career . In 1967 , Dodd passed the head coach position to his favorite assistant , Bud Carson . Dodd continued to work as athletic director which he had first been hired as in 1950 . He would not retire from athletic directing until 1976 . In 1983 , he said he would like to run a United States Football League team if Atlanta was given one . The league , however , shut down before Atlanta received a team .
Dodd wanted to win every game , but unlike some other coaches , he did not believe in risking his athletes ' health in order to win . He believed that the most important part of college football was the college football player .
In honor of the character of Dodd , each year a Division I college coach who has shown leadership both on and off the field is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award . This award is given by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation . He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1959 and as a coach in 1993 . In 1988 , Georgia Tech named its stadium Bobby Dodd Stadium in honor of him . The Bobby Dodd Institute is a group that helps people with disabilities ; it is named in honor of Dodd for his help to the disabled .
David Crockett -LRB- August 17 , 1786 â `` March 6 , 1836 -RRB- was an American frontiersman , soldier , politician , and folk hero . He is more often called Davy Crockett . He also has the nickname â King of the Wild Frontierâ . He represented the state of Tennessee in the U.S. House of Representatives . He was part of the Texas Revolution . He died in the Battle of the Alamo .
Crockett was born in Tennessee . A replica of the cabin he was born in stands today in Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park in Tennessee . The Crockett family 's name comes from the name Monsieur de la Croquetagne . Monsieur de la Croquetagne was a captain in the Royal Guard of French King Louis XIV . The family became Protestants and ran away from France in the 17th century . Crockett did not have an easy childhood . He traveled around a lot , and had a lot of adventures . He started hunting with his brothers before his ninth birthday . A little after he started going to school , he beat up a bully . He stopped going to school so that his teacher would not punish him . His teacher told his father that Crockett was not at school . He then ran away from home so that his father would not beat him . He started moving around Tennessee . This was all according to a book Davy Crockett wrote about himself .
He came back home when he was 15 . His family welcomed him back . He married Mary -LRB- Polly -RRB- Finley a day before his twentieth birthday . They had three children . However , Polly died at a young age . He married another woman named Elizabeth Patton in 1815 . They had three children together .
Crockett served in the Tennessee Militia for a few years , then ran for Congress in 1824 . He lost his election , but ran again in the next election . In 1826 , he was elected to the United States House of Representatives . As a Congressman , he became angry about President Andrew Jackson 's Indian Removal Act , which forced Native Americans to leave their land . He lost his re-election in 1830 . However , he ran again in 1832 and won .
In 1834 , he wrote a book about himself called A Narrative of the Life of David Crockett . Written by Himself . He lost his re-election to Congress that year , and in 1834 , he lost in an election again .
Around December 1834 , Crockett told some of his friends that he might move to Texas if Martin Van Buren became the next president of the United States . The next year , he talked to his friend Benjamin McCulloch about going to Texas , which belonged to Mexico at that time , with some people to fight in a revolution against Mexico . Van Buren was elected president , so he left Tennessee on Nov. 1 , 1835 with three other men to go to Texas , saying , `` You may all go to hell and I will go to Texas '' .
He arrived in Nacogdoches , Texas , in early January 1836 . On January 14 , 1836 , Crockett and 65 other men signed an oath before Judge John Forbes to the Provisional Government of Texas for six months that said `` I have taken the oath of government and have enrolled my name as a volunteer and will set out for the Rio Grande in a few days with the volunteers from the United States . '' Each man was promised about 4,600 acres -LRB- 19 kmÂ -RRB- of land .
He showed up at the Battle of the Alamo on February 8 . There were over 100 other men there . On February 23 , a Mexican army , led by General Antonio LÃ pez de Santa Anna , showed up , and the Mexican army surrounded the Alamo , ready to take it over . After the Mexican army had been there for eight days , 32 other men showed up to help Crockett and the other men defending the Alamo .
On March 6 , after the Mexican army had been there for 12 days , the Mexican army attacked just before dawn while the defenders were sleeping . According to Susana Dickinson , before running to his post , Crockett stopped in the chapel to pray . When the Mexican soldiers made it over the walls of the Alamo , the defenders stayed behind the low wall in front of the church , using their rifles as clubs and using knives because they did not have time to reload their guns . After firing shots and charging with bayonets , Mexican soldiers pushed the few remaining defenders back toward the church . The Battle of the Alamo lasted almost 90 minutes . All of the men defending the Alamo died , including Davy Crockett . That evening , the Mexican army lit a fire and burned the bodies of the men who defended the Alamo to ashes .
Even while he was still alive , many books and plays were written about Crockett 's life , some of which stretched the truth . Since his death , he has become a popular figure in American folklore . In the 1950s , there was a television show about him , which had a song called `` The Ballad of Davy Crockett '' which was very popular . Many children wore `` coonskin '' hats to look like him .

Guillaume Dufay -LRB- pronounce `` GHEE-oam Doo-FYE '' , sometimes spelt Du Fay -RRB- -LRB- born Beersel ? 5 August 1397 ? ; died Cambrai , 27 November 1474 -RRB- was a Franco-Flemish composer and music theorist of the early Renaissance . He was the most important composer of his time . He belonged to the group of composers known as the Burgundian School . He had more influence on music in Europe than any other composer of the 15th century .
From what it says in his will it seems likely that he was born in Beersel which is near Brussels in what , today , is Belgium . He was the illegitimate child of an unknown priest and a woman called Marie Du Fayt . When he was small , Dufay moved with his mother to Cambrai where they stayed with a relative who was a canon of the cathedral there . Dufay soon showed musical talent , and he was given a musical education at the cathedral . He sang in the choir there . When he was only 16 he was given a benefice as chaplain near Cambrai . He traveled to Konstanz for a meeting .
From November 1418 to 1420 he was a subdeacon at Cambrai Cathedral . In 1420 he left Cambrai again , and worked in Rimini in Italy at the house of a rich family . In 1424 he returned to Cambrai because the relative in whose house his mother was staying was ill. . After the relative died he went back to Italy . He worked in Bologna for a Cardinal . He became a deacon and then a priest .
When the Cardinal was made to leave Bologna in 1428 Dufay went to Rome to work for the pope . He became a member of the Papal Choir . In 1434 he was made maistre de chappelle in Savoy . He seems to have left Rome when the papal choir had money problems . Yet in 1435 he was again in the service of the papal chapel , but this time it was in Florence . In 1436 Dufay composed the festive motet Nuper rosarum flores , one of his most famous compositions , which was sung at the dedication of Brunelleschi 's dome of the cathedral in Florence .
During this period Dufay also began his long association with the d'Este family in Ferrara , some of the most important musical patrons of the Renaissance . He may have got to know them during his first stay in Italy . Rimini was not far from Ferrara , and he spent time in both towns where he got financial support .
At this time the arguments between the Pope and the Council of Basel continued . Dufay thought he might find himself without a job , so he went back to Cambrai . In order to be a canon at Cambrai , he needed a law degree , which he got in 1437 ; he may have studied at Turin University in 1436 . One of the first documents mentioning him in Cambrai is dated December 27 , 1440 , when he was given 36 lots of wine for the feast of St. John the Evangelist . We do not know how long he took to drink it .
Dufay stayed in Cambrai during the 1440s . At the same time he was also in the service of the Duke of Burgundy . While in Cambrai he worked with Nicolas Grenon on completely renewing the cathedral collection of music . This meant that he had to write a big collection of polyphonic music for services . He also worked in the administration of the cathedral . In 1444 his mother died , and was buried in the cathedral ; and in 1445 Dufay moved into the house of the person who had been canon just before . He kept this home for the rest of his life , although he did spend six more years in Italy where he wrote many of his compositions . When he returned again to Cambrai he was made canon of the cathedral . He was the most famous composer in Europe by that time . He often composed music for the court of Burgundy , and he met many younger composers who were becoming famous , such as Busnois , Ockeghem , Tinctoris , and Loyset CompÃ re . During this period Dufay probably wrote his mass based on the song L'homme armÃ , as well as the chanson based on the same song . Maybe he wrote this when Philip the Good called for a new crusade against the Turks , who had recently captured Constantinople . He also wrote a Requiem mass around 1460 , which is lost .
After an illness of several weeks , Dufay died on November 27 , 1474 . He had asked for his motet Ave regina celorum to be sung for him as he died , with pleas for mercy to be read between some of the movements , but there was not enough time for this to be arranged , so it was sung at his funeral instead . Dufay was buried in the chapel of St. Etienne in the cathedral of Cambrai ; his portrait was carved onto his tombstone . In later years the cathedral was destroyed , and the tombstone was lost , but it was found in 1859 -LRB- it was being used to cover a well -RRB- , and is now in the Palais des Beaux Arts museum in Lille .
Dufayâ s music was performed all over Europe . People who wanted to perform his music had to write it out by hand . There was no music printing in those days .
Dufay wrote church music including masses , motets , Magnificats , hymns , simple chant settings and antiphons . His secular -LRB- non-religious -RRB- music includes rondeaux , ballades , virelais and a few other kinds of chanson . His style of composition laid the foundation for the next generations of Renaissance composers . Some of his techniques were old-fashioned . He used isorhythms in his motets , which had been popular in medieval music . He used a way of harmonizing chants which became known as fauxbourdon . He was popular because he was skilled at writing melodies which were beautiful to sing .

Mathematics has shown that any object can be reassembled into any other object . For example , a sphere can be split up into multiple parts which can then be put back together again to make two identical copies of the original sphere .
The reason this seems to be a paradox is because no stretching or bending of the parts takes place and no new material is added yet by the end the volume can be doubled . This goes against our geometric intuition . However , it is mathematically possible and it just turns out that our intuition about nonmeasurable sets is not correct .

Capsicum is a genus of plants from the nightshade family -LRB- Solanaceae -RRB- . Some of these plants are used as spices , vegetables , or drugs . The fruit of Capsicum plants have a variety of names . The names vary depending on place and type . They are commonly called Chili pepper , red or green pepper , or just pepper in Britain and the US ; the large mild form is called bell pepper in the US , capsicum in Australian English and Indian English , and paprika in some other countries -LRB- although paprika can also refer to the powdered spice made from various capsicum fruit -RRB- .
Capsicums originated in the Americas , but are now grown worldwide .
The fruit of most species of Capsicum contains capsaicin . Capsaicin is a chemical that can produce a strong burning sensation in the mouth -LRB- and , if not properly digested , anus -RRB- of the unaccustomed eater . Most mammals find this unpleasant ; however , birds are unaffected . The plants developed the secretion of capsaicin to protect the fruit from being eaten by mammals . At the same time , the bright colors attract birds . These birds will spread the seeds . The amount of capsaicin in peppers is highly variable and dependent on genetics . This means that almost all types of peppers have varied amounts of heat felt by those consuming them . The only pepper without capsaicin is the bell pepper . Chili peppers are of great importance in Native American medicine . Capsaicin is also used in modern Western medicine to stimulate blood circulation or to relieve pain .
Black pepper and Sichuan pepper cause similar burning sensations . These are caused they by different substances though â '' piperine and hydroxy-alpha-sanshool , respectively .
Capsicum fruits and peppers can be eaten raw or cooked . Those used in cooking are generally varieties of the C. annuum and C. frutescens species , though a few others are used as well . They are suitable for stuffing with fillings such as cheese , meat or rice .
They are also frequently used both chopped and raw in salads , or cooked in stir-fries or other mixed dishes . They can be sliced into strips and fried , roasted whole or in pieces , or chopped and incorporated into salsas or other sauces .
They can be preserved by drying or pickling . Dried peppers may be reconstituted whole , or processed into flakes or powders . Pickled or marinated peppers are frequently added to sandwiches or salads . Extracts can be made and incorporated into hot sauces .
In 2005 , a poll of 2,000 people revealed the capsicum pepper to be Britain 's 4th favorite culinary vegetable .
Many varieties of the same species can be used in many different ways ; for example , C. annuum includes the `` bell pepper '' variety , which is sold in both its immature green state and its red , yellow or orange ripe state . .
This same species has other varieties as well , such as the Anaheim chiles often used for stuffing , the dried Ancho chile used to make chili powder , the mild-to-hot JalapeÃ o , and the smoked ripe JalapeÃ o , known as a Chipotle .
Most of the capsaicin in a pepper is found in the interior ribs that divide the chambers of the fruit , and to which the seeds are attached . At the stem end of the pod , glands secrete the capsaicin , which then spreads throughout , but is concentrated on the ribs and seeds . The amount varies very significantly by variety , and is measured in Scoville heat units -LRB- SHU -RRB- , ranging from the mild bell pepper to the scorching Habanero chile .
The name given to the fruits varies between English-speaking countries .
In Australia , New Zealand and India , heatless species are called `` capsicums '' while hot ones are called `` chilli\/chillies '' -LRB- double L -RRB- . The term `` bell peppers '' is rarely used , usually in reference to C. annuum and other varieties which look like a `` capsicum '' or bell but are fairly hot .
In the United Kingdom , Ireland , and Canada , the heatless varieties are called `` peppers '' , `` sweet peppers '' or `` capsicums '' -LRB- or `` green peppers , '' `` red peppers , '' etc -RRB- while the hot ones are `` chilli\/chillies '' -LRB- double L -RRB- or `` chilli peppers '' .
In the United States , the common heatless species is referred to as `` bell peppers , '' `` sweet peppers , '' `` red\/green\/etc peppers , '' or simply `` peppers '' , while the hot species are collectively called `` chile\/chiles , '' `` chili\/chilies , '' or `` chili\/chile peppers '' -LRB- one L only -RRB- , `` hot peppers '' , or named as a specific variety -LRB- e.g. , banana pepper -RRB- . In many midwestern regions of the United States the Sweet Bell Pepper is commonly called a mango . With the modern advent of fresh tropical fruit importers exposing a wider latitude of individuals to the tropical fruit variety of the Mango , this definition is becoming archaic . However many menus still call a stuffed Bell Pepper a Mango .
The name `` pepper '' came into use because the plants were hot in the same sense as the condiment black pepper , Piper nigrum . But there is no botanical relationship with this plant , nor with Sichuan Pepper .
In Spanish-speaking countries there are many different names for each variety and preparation . In Mexico the term chile is used . Several other countries , such as Chile , whose name is unrelated , PerÃ , and Argentina , use ajÃ . In Spain , heatless varieties are called pimiento and hot varieties guindilla .
In Indian English , the word `` capsicum '' is used exclusively for bell pepper . All other varieties of chili peppers are called chili . In northern India and Pakistan , bell pepper is also commonly called `` Shimla Mirch '' in the native languages . Shimla incidentally is a popular hill-station in India -LRB- and `` Mirch '' means chili in native languages -RRB- .
In Israel capsicum is commonly called pilpel , meaning pepper in Hebrew .
You can test how hot a hot pepper can be by using the Scoville scale .
Capsicum is excellent source of laxative -LRB- purgative -RRB- and pain relief . Capsaicin has also been recently shown to have prostate cancer fighting effects .

The Raccoon -LRB- Procyon lotor -RRB- , also known as the Northern Raccoon , Common Raccoon , Washer Bear or Coon , is a widespread , medium-sized , omnivorous mammal native to North America .
Recognized by its striped face and ringed tail , the raccoon has invaded almost every habitat and is commonly found even in towns and cities . The raccoon is curious , clever , and solitary and deceptively cuddly-looking . It owes its success to its ability to live in a wide variety of habitats and survive on a flexible diet . It usually dies because of traffic accidents and hunting .
Although most raccoons live in the wild , close contact with humans does not bother them . They often nest in empty buildings , garages , sheds , and even the attics of houses . Since raccoons are nocturnal animals , they are most active at night . Raccoons do not hibernate in the winter , but those that live farther north , where it is colder , grow thick coats to keep them warm and spend long periods sleeping . Raccoons , when they are captured , can live up to 20 years , but they usually live in the wild only 1-3 years .

Initially , Bathilde was considered as a possible bride for a distant cousin , Ferdinand , Duke of Parma , the favorite grandson of King Louis XV of France , however , that marriage never materialised .
Finally , in 1770 , when she was twenty years old , she was allowed to leave the convent and marry her younger cousin , the Louis Henri de Bourbon , son and heir of Louis Joseph de Bourbon , Prince of CondÃ and his wife Charlotte Ã lisabeth Godefride de Rohan .
The scandal of her husband 's adultery came out in 1778 , and the consequences fell entirely on her shoulders . The couple separated in 1780 . As a separated spouse , she was never received at court and was forced to reorganise her life at the ChÃ cents teau de Chantilly .
In her isolation , she discreetly had an illegitimate daughter with a marine officer . Later , she passed the child off as the daughter of her secretary , in order to keep the little girl close to her . In 1787 , she purchased the Ã lysÃ e Palace from Louis XVI and had a hamlet constructed there .
During the French Revolution , just like her brother Philippe Ã galitÃ , Bathilde discovered democracy . She fell out with her royalist husband and son , who both chose to leave France after the storming of the Bastille . As the Ancien RÃ gime crumbled , she took the name , Citoyenne VÃ ritÃ , `` Citizeness Truth '' . Threatened by the new revolutionary government , she offered her wealth to the First French Republic before it could be confiscated .
In April 1793 , her nephew , the young Duke of Chartres -LRB- future Louis Philippe of the French -RRB- , fled France and sought asylum with the Austrians . In retribution , the National Convention decreed the imprisonment of all Bourbons remaining in France . While other members of the OrlÃ ans family still in France were kept under house arrest , Bathilde , Philippe Ã galitÃ and his sons were imprisoned in the Fort Saint-Jean in Marseille . Badly rewarded for her fidelity to the democratic ideals of the Revolution , she survived a year and a half in a prison cell . In November of the same year , her brother was guillotined . Miraculously spared during the Reign of Terror , Bathilde was freed during the Thermidorian Reaction and returned to her Ã lysÃ e residence in Paris . Poverty-stricken , she was forced to rent out most of the palace .
In 1797 , the Directoire decided to exile the last of the Bourbons still living in France . With her sister-in-law , Louise Marie AdÃ laÃ de de Bourbon , she went to Spain with her illegitimate daughter . Despite being forty-seven years old at the time , during the months which this journey took , she had an amorous intrigue with a handsome twenty-seven year old police officer -LRB- gendarme -RRB- under whose responsibility she had been put . The two maintained a correspondence during her exile .
Relegated to a place near Barcelona , Bathilde founded , despite her small means , a pharmacy and dispensary for the poor , and her house became a gathering place for those who needed aid . She became completely republican during this time period , despite her exile .
In 1804 , she learned that NapolÃ on I , whom she admired , had had her only son , Louis Antoine , Duke of Enghien , kidnapped , and executed by firing squad in the moat of the ChÃ cents teau de Vincennes . For ten years , the emperor kept the mother of his most famous victim from setting foot in France . Bathilde got her revenge in 1814 , when the people , seeing in her the mother of the `` Martyr of Vincennes , '' cheered her as she traveled the route back to Paris .
In 1815 , at the start of the Bourbon Restoration , she returned to France . Louis XVIII traded with her the HÃ tel Matignon for the Ã lysÃ e Palace . Bathilde promptly installed a community of nuns on the premises and charged them with praying for the souls of the victims of the Revolution . Her family , in the new moral order of the day , wanted to see her rejoin her husband after a separation of thirty-five years , but she refused . Instead , she resumed her affair with the police officer who had escorted her to Spain in 1797 .
In 1822 , while she was taking part in a march towards the PanthÃ on , she lost consciousness , and drew her last breath in the home of a law professor who taught at the Sorbonne . After her death , her nephew , Louis-Philippe , wanting to give an air of respectability to her bohemian lifestyle , burned the manuscript of her memoirs and a file on her young police officer located in the war archives .
She was buried in the OrlÃ ans family chapel the CollÃ giale de Dreux .

Most wagons were pulled by oxen . Some were pulled by mules , and a few were pulled by horses .
The Oregon Trail was first traveled around 1841 . Once a railroad was built across the United States in 1869 , people could take trains to the western United States , so fewer people began to travel west in wagons .
In the 1970s , three student teachers in Minnesota made an educational computer game based on the Oregon Trail . The goal of the game was to successfully travel the trail from Independence , Missouri to the Willamette Valley in Oregon . Dangers of the trail included river crossings , illnesses , sick oxen , and hunger . Over the next two decades , new versions of the game were made that added more options and included better graphics .

In politics , the presence of a Roman Emperor was felt to be desirable long after the empire fell . This tendency reached its peak when Charlemagne was crowned `` Roman Emperor '' in the year 800 , an act which led to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire . The notion that an emperor is a monarch who outranks a mere king dates from this period . In this political ideal , there would always be a Roman Empire , a state whose jurisdiction extended to the entire civilized western world .

Unless the revelation is personal , the follower must to some extent rely on the judgment or the stories of others . Assuming the revelation is personal , the follower is still ignoring the revelations of those before him .

In the mid - to late 1800s , Hamilton became an industrial city with lots of factories . It was close to limestone from the Niagara Escarpment , coal from the United States , iron ore mined from northern Ontario . But factories demanded that people work hard jobs for long hours . In 1872 , Hamilton workers marched for a work day of no more than nine hours ! The two large steel factories were Stelco -LRB- the Steel Company of Canada -RRB- , created in 1910 and the Dofasco -LRB- Dominion Steel Casting Company -RRB- in 1912 .

King and Main Streets are major roads that are almost parallel or side by side one another . They cross at the Delta in east Hamilton . For most of King and Main , cars could only travel one way .

The term Sexual revolution was coined by Wilhelm Reich in his book The Sexual Revolution . That book was first published in 1945 . Reich wrote in the book what he saw as wrong , namely the double standard regarding morals in the society of his time . These double standards and the suppression of the sex drive would make people different . This would lead to a buildup of aggressions and frustration .
Freeing the sex drive would lead to a peaceful change of society , according to Reich .
These ideas meant that some people in the 1960s radically changed their views regarding sex . They were very open-minded about it . The publications of people like Alfred Kinsey helped give wings to the movement .
Modern art refers to artistic works produced from the 1860s to about the 1970s . It refers to the style and philosophy of the art produced during that era . p102 The period coincides with the invention of mechanical means of recording images : photography and film .
The term modern art is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation . p419 Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art . A tendency toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art . More recent artistic production is often called Contemporary art or Postmodern art .
Modern art begins with the heritage of painters like Vincent van Gogh , Paul CÃ zanne , Paul Gauguin , Georges Seurat and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec all of whom were essential for the development of modern art . At the beginning of the 20th century Henri Matisse and several other young artists including the pre-cubist Georges Braque , AndrÃ Derain , Raoul Dufy and Maurice de Vlaminck revolutionized the Paris art world with ` wild ' , multi-colored , expressive , landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called Fauvism .
Henri Matisse 's two versions of The Dance marked a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting . It reflected Matisse 's fascination with primitive art : the intense warm color of the figures against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of the dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and hedonism .
Pablo Picasso made his first cubist paintings based on CÃ zanne 's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids : cube , sphere and cone . With the painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon 1907 , Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes , violently painted women , reminiscent of African tribal masks and his own new Cubist inventions .
Analytic cubism was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque , exemplified by Violin and Candlestick , Paris , from about 1908 through 1912 . Analytic cubism , the first clear manifestation of cubism , was followed by Synthetic cubism , practiced by Braque , Picasso , Fernand LÃ ger , Juan Gris , Albert Gleizes , Marcel Duchamp and several other artists into the 1920s .

The notion of modern art is closely related to Modernism . `` One way of understanding the relation of the terms ` modern , ' ` modernity , ' and ` modernism ' is that ... modernist art is scarcely thinkable outside the context of the modernized society of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries . Social modernity is the home of modernist art , even where that art rebels against it '' . p13
Modern art was introduced to the United States in 1913 and through European artists who moved to the U.S. during World War I. It was only after World War II , however , that the U.S. became the focal point of new artistic movements . The 1950s and 1960s saw the emergence of Abstract Expressionism , one of the most important of the later modernist art movements .
Modern art and Impressionism dominates the world art markets . Of the 20 top art prices , only one is a work of classical art . The world 's highest price for a work of art is Jackson Pollock 's No. 5 , 1948 privately sold by Sotheby 's for -LRB- price adjusted -RRB- $ 151.2 million dollars .

In the context of Russian Orthodox church history , the Old Believers became separated after 1666 - 1667 . They split from the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church as a protest against church reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon . Old Believers continue liturgical practices which the Russian Orthodox Church maintained before the implementation of these reforms . Russian-speakers refer to the schism itself as raskol -LRB- Ñ Ð Ñ Ð Ð 3\/4 Ð '' - etymologically indicating a `` cleaving-apart '' -RRB- .
Patriarch Nikon -LRB- 1605-1681 ; 1651-1658 as patriarch -RRB- wanted to bring the Russian Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Church closer together . For this reason , he changed a few rituals and texts in 1651 . These changes were made to the Russian rituals to be closer to the Greek ones of Nikon 's time . According to the Old Believers , Nikon did this without the support of the clergy . and without a council . When the changes were done , people who still practiced the old rites were persecuted .

Twitter is a website that gives users social networking and microblogging services through messages called `` tweets '' . Users use mobile phones or computers to send and to read tweets . Tweets can be up to 140 characters long . They appear on the user 's profile page . Tweets can usually be read by anyone , but senders can also keep messages private . Private tweets only go to their list of friends . Users may subscribe to tweets from other people . This is called following , and subscribers are known as followers . As of late 2009 , users can also follow lists of authors .
All users can send and receive tweets using the Twitter website . They can also use other applications that work with Twitter on smartphones . Twiiter by Short Message Service -LRB- SMS -RRB- is available in certain countries . Using Twiter is free , but sending or getting tweets by SMS may cost money . The website is based in San Bruno , California . Twitter also has servers and offices in San Antonio , Texas and Boston , Massachusetts , and soon in Salt Lake City , Utah .
Twitter has become very popular worldwide since Jack Dorsey created it in 2006 . It now has more than 100 million users . It is sometimes described as the `` SMS of the Internet . ''
Twitter started at a podcasting company Odeo . The company board members had a `` daylong brainstorming session . '' During the meeting , Jack Dorsey introduced the idea of one person using an SMS service to communicate with a small group . At first , they called this project `` twttr '' . It fit the five character length of American SMS short codes and sounded like Flickr . At first , the developers planned to use `` 10958 '' as a short code . Later they changed it to `` 40404 '' because it was easier to remember and type . Dorsey sent the first Twitter message at 9:50 PM Pacific Standard Time -LRB- PST -RRB- March 21 , 2006 . The first tweet was , `` just setting up my twttr . ''
The first version of Twitter was only for Odeo employees to use . They opened the full version for anyone to use on July 15 , 2006 . In October 2006 , Biz Stone , Evan Williams , Dorsey , and other members of Odeo started a new company called Obvious Corporation . Obvious Corporation bought Odeo and all of its propertyâ `` including Odeo.com and Twitter.com â `` from the investors and shareholders . Twitter became its own separate company in April 2007 .
Twitter started becoming very popular after the 2007 South by Southwest -LRB- SXSW -RRB- festival . During the event , Twitter usage increased from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000 . The Twitter company set up two very large computer screens in the hallways at the conference . These screens only showed Twitter messages . Hundreds of people at the conference checked on what each other were doing by looking at the many tweets . Panelists and speakers talked about Twitter . Bloggers at SXSW described it to others in a very positive way .
Reaction at the festival was very good . Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter `` absolutely rul -LRB- ed -RRB- '' SXSW . Social software researcher Danah Boyd said Twitter `` own -LRB- ed -RRB- '' the festival . Twitter staff won the festival 's Web Award prize . They said , `` we 'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less . And we just did ! ''

Technology author Steven Johnson described the basic way Twitter works . He called it `` remarkably simple . '' Following is an important part of Twitter as a social network . Users ' Twitter home pages show all of the tweets from people they follow . The tweets appear from newest to oldest . Johnson said :
Twitter is one of the 10 most visited websites in the world .
People can use software from other companies to access Twitter . These programs are called third-party applications . The Twitter company changed the way this works on 31 August 2010 . Now applications must use OAuth to connect to Twitter . This method means that users do not have to give their passwords to the third-party applications . Changing the login system to OAuth did cause some problems . Using OAuth had been optional and programs used to be able to ask for usernames and passwords . However , now third-party applications that try to use a username and password do not work at all . The Twitter company said that using OAuth will give users `` increased security and a better experience . ''
On April 30 , 2009 , Twitter changed the way it looks on the web . They added a search bar and a space on the right side of the page with `` Trending Topics '' . That space shows the most common phrases appearing in messages . Biz Stone explained that all messages are instantly indexed and explained the results of the change . The Trending Topics has made Twitter something `` unexpectedly important â '' a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now . '' Sometimes Twitter users experience a problem with the service and can not access the website . They can not read or write tweets but only see the Fail Whale image created by Yiying Lu ,
Twitter worked well approximately 98 % of the time in 2007 . That is about six full days of no service . The problems were particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the 2008 Macworld Conference & Expo keynote address .
Twitter developed several software projects to improve their own service . The company shared these as open source software . Some of these software projects are related to databases , such as the Gizzard Scala framework and a distributed graph database called FlockDB .
t. co is a service created by Twitter to make URLs shorter . It can only be used for links that people post to Twitter . It is not available for other uses . Eventually all links on Twitter will use t. co. . The company hopes that the service will protect users from harmful websites . They will also use it to keep a record of people clicking on links in tweets .
Twitter had used the services from other sites such as TinyURL and bit . ly . They began trying their own way of making URLs shorter for direct messages in March 2010 . They used the domain , twt . tl , before they bought the t. co domain .
The company is using these accounts to test the service on the main site : SYM TwitterAPI , SYM rsarver , and SYM raffi .
On 2 September 2010 , Twitter sent an email message to users to explain that they were starting to open the service to them .
Twitter can also be used as an amateur and professional news source .

Kota Kinabalu , formerly Jesselton , is the capital of Sabah state in Malaysia . It is also the capital of the West Coast Division of Sabah . The city is located on the northwest coast of Borneo facing the South China Sea . The Tunku Abdul Rahman National Park lies on one side and Mount Kinabalu , which gave the city its name , is nearby . Kota Kinabalu proper has a population of 579,304 , while the larger urban area has an estimated population of 700,000 . It is the largest urban center in Sabah and the sixth largest in Malaysia .
Kota Kinabalu is often known as K.K. within Malaysia and internationally . It is a major tourist destination and a popular gateway for travellers visiting Sabah and Borneo . Kinabalu National Park is located about 90 kilometres from the city and there are many tourist attractions in and around the city . Kota Kinabalu is also one of the major industrial and commercial centres of East Malaysia . These two factors combine to make Kota Kinabalu one of the fastest growing cities in Malaysia .
In the late 1800s , the British North Borneo Company -LRB- BNBC -RRB- began to establish colonies throughout North Borneo -LRB- now Sabah -RRB- . In 1882 , the Company founded a small settlement on Gaya Island -LRB- Pulau Gaya -RRB- , which was already inhabited by the Bajau people . In 1897 , this first settlement was burned and destroyed by Bajau rebels led by Mat Salleh .
After the rebellion , the Company decided to relocate the settlement to the more easily defended mainland opposite Pulau Gaya . A nearby fishing village named Api-Api -LRB- see Original names below -RRB- , was the next settlement of the Company . This new location was then designated as the main harbor and port , as well as the terminus for the North Borneo Railway . It was expanded and renamed Jesselton , named after Sir Charles Jessel , the then Vice Chairman of the Company .
Eventually , Jesselton became a major trading post of North Borneo , dealing in rubber , rattan , honey , and wax . The new railway was used to transport goods to Jesselton harbor . Bajau uprisings during these times were not uncommon , and the Company worked to quell the long-standing threat of piracy in the region .
Jesselton was razed by the retreating British early in World War II to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Japanese . After the Japanese takeover of Borneo , it was again renamed Api . Rebellions against the Japanese military administration have taken place in Api . One major rebellion occurred in 1943 by the group called Kinabalu Guerrillas , consisting of local inhabitants . The rebellion was however quelled by the Japanese forces , after their leader , Albert Kwok , was arrested and executed in 1944 . At the later stages of the war , what remained of the town was destroyed again by Allied bombings as part of the Borneo Campaign in 1945 , leaving only three buildings standing . The war in North Borneo ended with the official surrender of the Japanese 37th Army by Lieutenant General Baba Masao in Labuan on September 10 , 1945 .
After the war , the British North Borneo Company returned to administer Jesselton but was unable to finance the huge costs of reconstruction . They gave control of North Borneo to the British Crown in 1946 . The new colonial government elected to rebuild Jesselton as the capital of North Borneo instead of Sandakan , which had also been destroyed by the war .
When North Borneo together with Sarawak , Singapore & Federation of Malaya formed the Federation of Malaysia in 1963 , the state became known as Sabah and Jesselton remained its capital . Jesselton was renamed Kota Kinabalu on September 30 , 1968 and received official city status from the Malaysian government on February 2 , 2000 .
Kota Kinabalu is named after Mount Kinabalu , situated about 90 kilometres east-northeast of the city . The meaning and origin of the name Kinabalu is uncertain . One theory suggests it means `` Chinese widow '' , where Kina meaning `` Chinese '' -LRB- person -RRB- in Kadazandusun language , and balu meaning `` widow '' in Malay language . This theory derives from a folk tale about a Chinese prince who came to the mountain in search of a giant pearl which was guarded by a dragon at the top of the mountain . While he was here , he married a local woman but later returned to China and left the woman heartbroken . Alternatively , it is also argued that Kinabalu or Akinabalu is the name of the dragon which guards the giant pearl itself . Another theory suggests that the term is derived from the name Aki Nabalu meaning the `` revered place of the dead '' , in which , Aki means `` ancestors '' or `` grandfather '' , and Nabalu being a name for the mountain in the Dusun language . Finally there is also a source claiming that the term originated from Ki Nabalu , where Ki meaning `` have '' or `` exist '' , and Nabalu meaning `` spirit of the dead '' .
Kota is a Malay word for a `` fort '' , `` town '' , or a `` city '' . It is also used formally in a few other Malaysian towns and cities , for example , Kota Bahru , Kota Tinggi , and Kota Kemuning . It could also be used informally to refer to any towns or cities . Henceforth , a direct translation of the name Kota Kinabalu into English would be `` City of Kinabalu '' or `` Kinabalu City '' .
Besides Jesselton , there has been a number of other claims as to the original name for Kota Kinabalu . The most popular , as mentioned above , is Api-Api , or sometimes simply Api , which is a Malay word meaning ` Fire ' . It was apparently named as such by the mainly Bajau locals to denote the blazing of the British administrative office in Pulau Gaya instigated by Mat Salleh , as well as other blazing incidents normally perpetrated by pirates . There were claims however that it was actually named after a nearby river called Sungai Api-Api . Another theory states that `` Api-Api '' is the local name of the common Avicennia tree found in abundance around the area . Transliterated into the formal Chinese name of Ya Bi -LRB- ä å yÃ bÃ -RRB- , the Hakkas here too adopted this name -LRB- ä å , `` ah-bi '' which pronounced in Hakka , Chinese dialects -RRB- and some still use this name to this day . Besides Api-Api , another suggested historical name was Deasoka , which roughly means `` below the coconut tree '' in the Bajau language . The Bajau locals purportedly used this name to refer to a village on the southern part of the city which was filled with coconut trees . Another name was Singgah Mata which literally mean `` transit eye '' , but can be loosely translated as meaning `` pleasing to the eye '' . It is a name purportedly given by fishermen from Pulau Gaya referring to the strip of land of what is today Kota Kinabalu city center . Today , all these names have been immortalised into names of streets or buildings around the city . Some examples are : Lintasan Deasoka , Api-Api Centre , Jalan Singgah Mata , and Jesselton Point .

The American Dream is the hope that in the United States of America , anyone can become rich or famous if they work hard and try their very best .
Many migrants , people who come to America from other countries , come to America because they hope for a better life . America is attractive to migrants , because often there is more freedom to become rich or famous than the country that they leave .
With American Dream is also meant to live free and equal with all other people in the USA .
The American Dream is also a main theme in the book by John Steinbeck , `` Of Mice and Men '' . The two friends George and Lennie dream of their own piece of land with a ranch , so they can `` live offa the fatta the lan ' '' and just enjoy a better life . But the symbolism shows this is futile due to the fact that it will never happen , and that they end up shooting Lennie in the back of the head , like Candy 's dog . This shows that not everyone can achieve the American dream , thus proving by contradiction it is not possible . Although it is possible to achieve the American dream for few .

Crete is the largest of the Greek islands .
Like the Fertile Crescent , Crete had rich soil , a warm climate , and plenty of water . With less time spent fighting to live , the Cretans began to make complicated things . From the wild crocus flowers which covered their island , the Cretans collected saffron used in yellow dye , in food , and in medicine . From the Egyptians , they received rich cloth and jewels . From the Hittites , they learned how to use iron . From the wealty Lydians , they learned to use money . From Phoneicia , the Cretans received the alphabet which is used today .
Cretans chose kings to rule over them for seven years each . The king was known as Minos , and the people Minoans . The capital of Crete was Knossos -LRB- nos ' us -RRB- . Beautiful friezes -LRB- decorating bands -RRB- were on the walls . The symbol of the double-ax was used , and is thought to represent the power of a king . The throne was only a seat with a high back , and the nobles had only benches to sit on . However , the benches were covered with red and white plaster . On the walls were painted fish , dolphins , and seaweed . The queen had her own private staircase so she could go upstairs without bothering the men . Several rooms in the palace had jars which were six feet tall , and were used to keep wheat , oil , dye and other things .
On Crete the Minoian Culture started in the 15th century before Christ . The palace of Knossos is well-known and is a labyrinth . Visitors were lost in the labyrinth unless they used a string behind them to find their way back . In this place , it was said that a Minotaur , half bull and half man , lived . Every year seven young men and seven girls were sacrificed to the Minotaur . Many scholars think sacrifices to a bull were made because the Cretans thought the sound of an earthquake was an angry bull .
The Cretans also worshipped the Great Mother Cybele , or Snake Goddess . Often , her picture was carved in statues with gold decorations and with snakes curled around the arms . Snakes were thought to protect houses , so each home had a special room for snakes . Sometimes a little table with groove cut into it was put in a comfortable place so snakes could sip some milk from a cup .
The Cretans loved games , food , athletics , music , and beautiful clothes . They were the first people to build stone theaters where many people were amused by parades and music . Girls could even help bullfighters . In bullfighting , the Minoans did not kill the bull , but the male fighter had to grab the horns of an attacking bull , throw himself on the back of the animal , and then land on the ground ; the girl helped the bullfighter keep his balance .
Women wore long , full skirts with very tiny waists , complicated hairstyles , and lots of jewelry . The men wore small belts around their waists . They shaved with stones , rubbed their teeth with pumice stone , and had their body hair burnt by a barber .
The Cretans ate fish , birds , and beef . They had barley cooked in many ways and ate lots of cheese , nuts , and honey . They thought only uncivilized people drank cow 's milk , so they drank goat 's milk instead . The Cretans sang , played games , and guessed riddles . Even though they ate with their fingers , they had the food cut into tiny pieces before it was served .
The Cretans were peaceful people without fortifications -LRB- something like a wall to stop or protect from an attack -RRB- . In about 1450 B.C. , the Greek Mycenaeans captured Crete , after Knossos , Crete 's capital , had been shaken by an earthquake .
