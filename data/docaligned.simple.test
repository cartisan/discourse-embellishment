Sufjan is an Arabic name that famously belonged to Abu Sufyan , a man from early Islamic history . The name was given to Stevens by the person who founded Subud , a spiritual community . Stevens said in an interview , `` It sounds like Devendra Banhart kind of grew up in this strange kind of cultish environment , and I do n't mean that word in a demeaning way . I think we probably come from similar backgrounds . There 's a little bit of that in my history . ''
Stevens is a multi-instrumentalist , a person who can play many musical instruments . He is well known for his use of the banjo , but also plays guitar , piano , drums , and several other instruments , often playing all of these on his albums by using multitrack recording .

Chlorine -LRB- chemical symbol Cl -RRB- is a chemical element . Its atomic number -LRB- which is the number of protons in it -RRB- is 17 , and its atomic mass is 35.45 . It is part of the 7th column -LRB- halogens -RRB- on the periodic table of elements .
Chlorine is very irritating and greenish-yellow gas . It has a strong smell like bleach . It is toxic . It can be made into a liquid when cooled . It is heavier than air .
Chlorine is highly reactive . It is more reactive than bromine but less reactive than fluorine . It reacts with most things to make chlorides . It can even burn things instead of oxygen . It dissolves in water to make a mixture of hypochlorous acid and hydrochloric acid . The more acidic it is , the more chlorine is made ; the more basic it is , the more hypochlorous acid -LRB- normally turned into hypochlorite -RRB- and hydrochloric acid -LRB- normally turned into chlorides -RRB- are there . Chlorine reacts with bromides and iodides to make bromine and iodine .
It exists in several oxidation states : -1 , +1 , +3 , +4 , +5 , and +7 . The -1 state is most often in chloride . Chlorides are not reactive . The +1 state is found in hypochlorites . It is a strong oxidizing agent , as are all + oxidation state compounds . +3 is found in chlorites . +4 is found in chlorine dioxide , a common chlorine compound that is not a chloride . +5 is found in chlorates . +7 is found in perchlorates . Hypochlorites are most reactive , while perchlorates are the least reactive .
Many organic compounds have chlorine in them . Freon has chlorine in it . PVC -LRB- Poly-vinyl chloride -RRB- , a common plastic , has chlorine in it .
Chlorine oxides can be made , but most of them are very reactive and unstable .
Chlorine is not found as an element . Sodium chloride is the most common chlorine ore. . It is found in the ocean -LRB- sea salt -RRB- and in the ground -LRB- rock salt -RRB- . There are some organic compounds that have chlorine in them , too .
It is made by electrolysis -LRB- the passing of electricity through a solution to make chemical reactions happen -RRB- of sodium chloride . This is known as the chloralkali process . It can also be made by reacting hydrogen chloride with oxygen and a catalyst . It can be made in the laboratory by reacting manganese dioxide with hydrochloric acid . It is made when sodium hypochlorite reacts with hydrochloric acid . This is a dangerous reaction that can happen without anyone knowing .
Chlorine is used widely to purify water -LRB- usually in a swimming pool -RRB- , as a disinfectant and bleach , and in the making of many important compounds including chloroform and carbon tetrachloride . It was used as a poison gas in some wars .
It was discovered in 1774 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele who thought it had oxygen in it . Chlorine was named in 1810 by Humphry Davy who insisted it was an element . The US made all water chlorinated -LRB- added chlorine to water -RRB- by 1918 .
It is poisonous in large amounts and can damage skin . When it is inhaled , it irritates the lungs , eyes , and skin badly . It can cause fire with some things because it is very reactive . It is heavier than air , so it can fill up enclosed spaces .

Semyon Grigorevich Frug -LRB- Szymon Frug -RRB- Semyon Grigorevich Frug was born in 1860 into a family of Jewish farmes who lived in one of the Jewish farming colonies in southern Ukraine . From 1912 unitl his death in 1916 , Frug lived in Odessa , where the sixth edition of his three-volume `` Complete Works `` was published in 1913 . His talent as a writer , narrator and reader reached their full expression Odessa , which was a center of Jewish literary activity . His contemporaries recalled the artistry with which he would read his work , or rather declaim them by hearth , at literary evenings . Frug 's works were mainly written in Russian with only a few stories written in Yiddish , itself a reflection of the environment in which members of the Jewish intelligentsia moved at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries . In both his poems and prose he described with bitter humor and ruthless realism the life of the Jewish colonists , their relationships with their Ukrainian and Russian neighbors , the disagreements and occasional full-blown heated arguments about the relative merits or lack thereof of various Yiddish dialects spoken by Jewish from Lithuania and Belorussia in contrast to those who had settled in the villages of Ukraine a long time before . Frug himself said in one of his poems , encapsulating his work maybe better than others , that the essence of his poetry is that `` What I took from people with tears and grief , I give back with poetry '' . One of the unique features of Frug 's poetry is the number of them that were set to music and performed on stage . http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymon_Frug http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view_page.jsp?artid=432&letter=F&pid=0

Prehistoric Britain was a period in the human occupation of Great Britain that ended with the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43 . -LRB- See : Roman Britain -RRB-
Britain has been inhabited for hundreds of thousands of years . None of the pre-Roman inhabitants of Britain had any written language , so their history , culture and way of life are known only through archaeological finds .
The first written record of Britain and its inhabitants was by the Greek navigator Pytheas , who explored the coastal region of Britain around 325 BC . Ancient Britons were however involved in extensive trade and cultural links with the rest of Europe from the Neolithic onwards , especially in exporting tin .
Palaeolithic Britain is the period from almost 750,000 years ago until around 10,000 years ago . This huge length of time saw many changes in the environment , several glacial and interglacial periods which greatly affected human settlement in the region .
There is evidence from bones and flint tools found in coastal deposits near Happisburgh in Norfolk and Pakefield in Suffolk that Homo erectus was present in what is now Britain around 700,000 years ago . At this time , southern and eastern Britain was linked to continental Europe by a wide land bridge allowing humans to move freely . The current position of the English Channel was a large river flowing westwards and fed by tributaries that would later become the Thames and Seine .
The extreme cold of the following Anglian glaciation is likely to have driven humans out of Britain altogether . A warmer time period lasted from around 300,000 until 200,000 years ago . The more advanced flint technology permitted more efficient hunting .
There is little evidence of human occupation during the subsequent Ipswichian interglacial between around 130,000 and 110,000 years ago .
Neanderthal occupation of Britain was limited and by 30,000 BC the first signs of modern human -LRB- Homo sapiens -RRB- activity . The most famous example from this period is the burial of the Red Lady of Paviland in modern day Wales . A final ice age covered Britain between around 70,000 and 10,000 years ago with an extreme cold snap between 22,000 and 13,000 years ago which may have driven humans south out of Britain altogether . The environment during this ice age period would have been a largely treeless tundra , eventually replaced by a warmer climate , perhaps reaching 17 degrees Celsius -LRB- 62.6 Fahrenheit -RRB- in summer which encouraged the expansion of birch trees as well as shrub and grasses .
The dominant food species were the Wild Horse -LRB- Equus ferus -RRB- and Red Deer -LRB- Cervus elaphus -RRB- although other mammals ranging from hares to mammoth were also hunted . By 10,500 years ago the climate was becoming cooler and dryer . Food animal populations seem to have declined although woodland coverage expanded . Tool manufacture in the Final Upper Palaeolithic revolved around smaller flints and bone and antler work became less common . However , the number of known sites is much larger and more widely spread . Many more open air sites are known such as that at Hengistbury Head .
Around 10,000 years ago the ice age finally ended . Temperatures rose , probably to levels similar to those today , and forests expanded farther . By 8,500 years ago , the rising sea levels caused by the melting glaciers cut Britain off from continental Europe for the last time . The warmer climate changed the Arctic environment to one of pine , birch , and alder forest .
Farming of both crops and domestic animals was adopted in Britain around 4,500 BC at least partly because of the need for reliable food sources .
Traditionally the arrival of the Neolithic in Britain has been seen as a wave of immigration from the continent . Modern archaeology now considers that farming along with pottery and settled living was in fact adopted by the native population who were related to the similarly newly-farming Neolithic people across the water . Links with continental Europe are demonstrated by finds of axes made from exotic stone such as jadeite .
Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of modern European populations shows that over 80 % are descended in the female line from European hunter-gatherers . Less than 20 % are descended in the female line from Neolithic farmers from the Middle East . In 1997 DNA analysis was undertaken on a tooth from a Mesolithic man whose remains were found in Gough 's Cave at Cheddar Gorge . His mitochondrial DNA was of a type found in 11 % of modern European populations .
Such findings have cast doubt on the traditional view of successive waves of mass immigration annihilating earlier peoples . In any case , the Neolithic Revolution , as it is called , introduced a more settled way of life and ultimately led to societies becoming divided into differing groups of farmers , artisans and leaders .
The construction of the earliest earthwork sites in Britain began during the early Neolithic -LRB- c. 4400 BC - 3300 BC -RRB- in the form of long barrows used for communal burial .
The Middle Neolithic -LRB- c. 3300 BC-c . 2900 BC -RRB- saw the development of cursus monuments close to earlier barrows . The earliest stone circles and individual burials also appear .
New enclosures , called henges were built , along with stone rows and the famous sites of Stonehenge and Silbury Hill reached their peak . Industrial flint mining such as that at Cissbury and Grimes Graves began .
In around 2,700 BC a new culture arrived in Britain , often referred to as the Beaker culture . Beaker pottery appears in the Mount Pleasant Phase -LRB- 2,700 BC - 2,000 BC -RRB- along with flat axes and burial practices of inhumation . The megalithic phases of Stonehenge date to this period .
Britain had large reserves of tin in the areas of Cornwall and Devon in what is now southwest England , and thus tin mining began . By around 1,600 BC the southwest of Britain had a trade boom as British tin was exported across Europe .
The Beaker people were also skilled at making ornaments from gold , and examples of these have been found in graves of the wealthy Wessex culture of southern Britain .
In around 750 BC iron working techniques reached Britain from southern Europe . Iron was stronger and more plentiful than bronze , and its introduction marks the beginning of the Iron Age . Iron working revolutionised many aspects of life , most importantly agriculture . Iron tipped ploughs could churn up land far more quickly and deeply than older wooden or bronze ones , and iron axes could clear forest land far more efficiently for agriculture .
About 900 BC , British society changed again . The Celtic culture had by 500 BC covered most of the British Isles . The Celts were highly skilled craftsmen and produced nicely patterned gold jewellery and weapons in bronze and iron .
Iron Age Britons lived in organised tribal groups , ruled by a chieftain .
As people became more numerous , fights broke out between opposing tribes . This led to the building of hill forts . The first had been built about 1,500 BC . Britain exported hunting dogs , animal skins and slaves .
The last centuries before the Roman invasion saw refugees from Gaul -LRB- modern day France and Belgium -RRB- known as the Belgae , who were displaced as the Roman Empire expanded .
From around 175 BC they settled in the areas of Kent , Hertfordshire and Essex and brought with them pottery making skills far more advanced than anything produced previously . The Belgae were partially Romanised and were responsible for creating the first settlements large enough to be called towns .
About 100 BC , iron bars began to be used as currency , coinage was developed , based on continental types .
As the Roman Empire expanded northwards , Rome began to take interest in Britain . See Roman Britain for the history of this period .
990 is a year in the 10th century .
Thoroughbred is a type of horse . They are mainly used for racing .
Horses have been used for many years , for farm , racing to harness work . Horses were the fastest way for people to travel on land before cars were invented and the only way to travel long distances in a reasonable amount of time . Most horse breeds have been bred for a specific reason ; the thoroughbred race horse was bred to run . Thoroughbreds originate from the Arabian breed , and all thoroughbreds can be traced back to three original sires -LRB- fathers -RRB- : The Byerley Turk , The Darley Arabian , and The Godolphin Arabian .
Thoroughbreds are known around the world for their speed , but also for their jumping ability , which make them good for show jumping and other horse activities . Although thoroughbreds generally are slightly temperamental , they are very trainable and loyal .
Thoroughbreds are generally tall and sleek , with long legs to help carry them along the race track . Thoroughbreds can be many colors , such as bay -LRB- a color which is brown with a black mane and tail -RRB- , chestnut -LRB- red-brown -RRB- , black and gray .
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION The appearance of the Thoroughbred reveals its Arabian ancestry . It has a refined head , with widely-spaced , intelligent eyes , a long , arched neck and prominent withers . The shoulder is extremely sloped . The heart girth is deep and relatively narrow . The croup is high and the quarters are substantial . The legs are clean and long with pronounced tendons . It has a long , low stride , giving it incomparable speed as a race horse . The Thoroughbred is predominately bay in color , but gray , black , brown and chestnut are also found . It stands between 15 and 17 hands , the Thoroughbreds best suited for sprinting have shorter backs , more substantial quarters and less height . ORIGIN The Thoroughbred 's genetic origin is Arabian . The Arabian foundation stallions which were brought to Britain in the late 1600s and early 1700s were bred to domestic mares - very probably Scottish Galloways - although they may have been bred to Arabian mares , too . A substantial number of early Thoroughbreds were bred in the vale of Bedale in the County of Yorkshire in Northern England .
The foundation stallions of the Thoroughbred breed and years in which they arrived in England were : the Byerly Turk -LRB- 1689 -RRB- , the Darley Arabian -LRB- 1705 -RRB- and the Godolphin Arabian -LRB- 1728 -RRB- . Their progeny were the first Thoroughbreds , per se , and although the foundation stallions had many off-spring , three of their descendants stand out as supreme : Herod , Eclipse and Matchem . In the lines of these horses were some outstanding Thoroughbreds : for instance , Princequillo and Round Table descend from Herod ; Citation and Sir Ivor descend from Eclipse ; and Man O ' War from Matchem .
INTERESTING FACTS The first Thoroughbred to arrive in America was a stallion named Bulle Rock , by the Darley Arabian . He was imported to Virginia in 1730 by Samuel Gist . In 1757 , Janus , a grandson of Godolphin Arabian , was imported and became the founder of the Quarter Horse breed . Diomed , who was imported in 1800 was the most important Thoroughbred imported to America in its early years . Lexington , by Boston , was foaled in 1850 and was the greatest sire of the 1800s .

Cosimo III de ' Medici -LRB- 14 August 1642 â `` 31 October 1723 -RRB- was the penultimate Grand Duke of Tuscany . He reigned from 1670 to 1723 , and was the elder son of Grand Duke Ferdinando II of Tuscany . Cosimo 's fifty long reign , the longest in Tuscan history , was marked by a series of regulatory laws . His reign also saw Tuscany 's bad finances become even worse . He was succeeded by his elder surviving son , Gian Gastone de ' Medici , when he died , in 1723 .
He married Marguerite Louise d'Orl Ã ans , a cousin of Louis XIV . It was a bad marriage and Marguerite Louise eventually left Tuscany to remain at the Convent of Montmartre in Paris . Together , they had 3 children . In later life , he tried to have Anna Maria Luisa recognized as heiress of Tuscany , but Charles VI , Holy Roman Emperor , would not allow it . Tuscany passed passed to the House of Lorraine in 1737 .
Frieza -LRB- ã ã ã 1\/4 ã , FurÄ `` za -RRB- is a fictional character in Dragon Ball Z.
Frieza is one of the strongest aliens in Dragon Ball Z. He enjoys at invading other planets . Frieza is very mean person who thinks he is very strong . He has destroyed planets , without caring . He will even kill his own servants . Frieza is always trying to get more power . Because of this , he ends up fighting the heroes of Dragon Ball Z so he can get the Dragon Balls . The Dragon Balls are magical balls that can grant wishes .
Frieza is what the creator , Akira Toriyama , thought monsters looked like in his childhood .
Frieza 's name is a pun on all things relating to the cold , with family members introduced later following his example . As his name ends in a short `` a '' vowel -LRB- rather than the long '' Ä '' which usually signifies `` er '' in kana spellings on English words -RRB- , the character 's name is typically spelled with an `` a '' at the end -LRB- as opposed to `` Freezer '' -RRB- . However , during FUNimation 's dubbing of Dragon Ball Z , the English writers went with the spelling of `` Frieza '' . This has led to some conjecture over it : U.S. released video games and the English dub use `` Frieza '' , while the Japanese language subtitles on FUNimation 's DVDs and the Viz translation of the manga uses `` Freeza . ''
Frieza spies on Vegeta during his mission on Earth and learns that there are Dragon Balls on Planet Namek . He wants to get them and wish that he would never die , so Frieza uses his soldiers to try and steal the Dragon Balls from the Namekians . After Cui , Dodoria and Zarbon , three of Frieza 's soldiers , are beaten by Vegeta , he sends the Ginyu Force , his strongest men , to get the Dragon Balls and destroy the Saiyan enemy . They almost win , but Goku comes to Namek and quickly defeats them .
While trying to learn how to summon Porunga , the namekian dragon , Frieza is confronted by Nail , the strongest of the Namek warriors . Frieza defeats Nail effortlessly , leaving him to die after discovering that dende has ran to the Z-fighters to tell Krillin and Gohan how to use the dragon balls . Enraged , the great tyrant follows in pursuit of the heroes only to be faced with a much more powerful Vegeta who is now capable of matching Frieza 's current strength .
Spurred on by Vegeta , Frieza unveils his second form , allowing him to defeat Vegeta and critically injure Krillin , taunting Gohan with his friend 's limp body . Before he can finish them off , Piccolo joins the battle - roughly even in abilities to Frieza , thanks to a splendid fusion with the dying Nail . The heroes are able to regroup , Dende healing them one after another . Frieza himself is seriously wounded for the first time : Krillin is able to chop off a portion of his tail using a Destructo Disk .
Having difficulty contending with Piccolo , Frieza again transformed , unlocking more of his power and enabling him to lay waste to his opponent . Finally he unveiled his true form , stressing that he intended to give his foes the pleasure of observing it before they died . As his first act , Frieza murders Dende , who had been healing the heroes , before brutally beating Vegeta . Just as Frieza was about to slay Vegeta , the healed Goku arrives on the battlefield , ready to fight Frieza . Vegeta , believing -LRB- incorrectly -RRB- that Goku had finally become a full-fledge Super Saiyan , taunts Frieza , even though , he , Vegeta , is too badly beaten to even stand . Frieza , proud of his past accomplishments , smirks before sending a Death Beam through the Saiyan Prince 's heart . Teetering on the brink of death , Vegeta is able to tell the newly-healed Goku of Frieza 's genocide of the Saiyan race , imploring him to take revenge on behalf for all Saiyans . As Vegeta finishes his plea to Goku , he dies . Goku , saddened by Vegeta 's death , buries him and vows to finish Frieza . Goku and Frieza then spar , with Frieza realizing that his opponent is the son of the Saiyan that gave him such trouble years before . Goku and Frieza are an even match for awhile , until Frieza reveals that he had only been fighting at a mere fraction of his full power . Frieza then increases to 50 % , and easily gains the upper hand against Goku , with Goku struggling to keep up .
Goku is eventually able to heavily wound Frieza using a Spirit Bomb , calling on the energies of the entire planet Namek .
Believing the warlord dead , the heroes take the time to relax , not noticing that Frieza had emerged from the blast 's crater . Frieza retaliates by mortally wounding Piccolo and murdering Krillin . Already bordering on the edge of his rage , Frieza killing Krillin , pushes Goku over it , his rage exploding , causing Frieza to inadvertently create what he had always feared : A Super Saiyan .
In the ensuing battle , Frieza and Goku trade blows , but as the fight progresses , Frieza 's power gradually diminishes with the repeated punishment . In frustration , Frieza sends a Death Ball into the core of the planet , starting a chain reaction that would destroy Namek in `` five minutes '' . Frieza unleashes 100 % of his power . Frieza is now able to launch a huge assault against the surprised Goku , who had not expected Frieza 's power to be as high as it is . Goku and Frieza face off and eventually after a very long battle , Goku gets the battle under his control , and calls off the fight , claiming it would be pointless to continue ; Frieza losing strength rapidly and Goku already having humbled the tyrant . Humiliated , Frieza refuses to relent , attacking Goku with two Tsuibi Kienzan . As Goku dodges the attacks , Frieza ironically becomes distracted long enough to be vivisected by his own attack .
Barely clinging to life but desperate to survive , Frieza begs and begs for mercy , which Goku hesitantly provides . Frieza 's arrogance refuses to allow him to be beaten and saved by a Saiyan `` monkey '' , and he expends what little energy he has left to attack Goku . Overcome with anger , Goku fires a Ki blast that consumes both Frieza and his attack , seemingly ending Frieza 's reign over the universe .
Unbeknownst to Goku , Frieza survived the destruction of Namek . Able to do nothing more than breathe , Frieza floated in the planet 's debris , kept company only by his thoughts of how the universe 's conqueror had been thoroughly beaten by a Saiyan . His father , King Cold , had crews search the area , not believing his son to have been killed by something as insignificant as the explosion of a planet . What could be found of Frieza was salvaged , his missing limbs and face reconstructed with cybernetic enhancements . Scarred and bitter - though feeling stronger than he had before . Frieza 's first thought upon rehabilitation is revenge on those who sullied him .
Frieza beats Goku to Earth . Despite his ill intentions towards Earth and all who lived there , Frieza notes `` It 's a good planet '' on first viewing -LRB- Dragon Ball # 330 -RRB- . Frieza orders his henchmen to find and slaughter its inhabitants , with Frieza keen on killing his enemy 's friends himself . However , his army is torn apart by the blade-wielding fighter Future Trunks . Frieza dismisses his challenger as an insolent child , and pays him almost no heed until the boy reveals himself as another Super Saiyan .
Dumbstruck , Frieza makes several different efforts to kill Trunks , each of which is parried easily . He then plays his trump card in the form of a Death Ball ten times the size of the one that destroyed Planet Namek . Even this is nonchalantly brushed away , until a mortified Frieza causes it to detonate with another shot of ki . Thinking him to be destroyed by the assault , both the father and son are stunned when Trunks fires the Burning Attack out of nowhere . Fuming , Frieza becomes oblivious to his opponent 's position , and is surprised and sliced in half by the Saiyan youth before being cut to pieces and blown to dust .
After his death , Frieza makes numerous cameo appearances throughout the remainder of the series from Hell , including observing Goku 's fight with Buu alongside other defeated villains from the series .
In Dragon Ball GT , he teams up with Cell to act as a distraction for Goku while a horde of villains from the Z-Fighters ' past escape Hell . Frieza traps Goku in the next world , but even allied with Cell , he is eventually defeated and remains in Hell .
Over time , Frieza 's power became so great that his body could not comfortably contain it , and a series of physical transformations were developed that limit his actual strength While changing shape from his `` first-form '' , each alteration builds on the previous . In all , Frieza demonstrated four transformed states , each with increasing power -LRB- some larger than others and each resulting in different physical attributes -RRB- .
; First form In his first form , Frieza is a relatively short humanoid , albeit with a large chestnut-shaped skull with two horns . He also has a tail with a spiked end , as well as having three talon-like toes . He wears the same upper-body armor that many of his subordinates -LRB- including the Saiyans -RRB- are shown to wear , and while traveling , often gives the appearance of weakness by exclusively using his hoverchair for transportation , leaving his henchmen to do his `` dirty work '' .
; Second form His second form is similar in appearance to the first , except much larger , both in height and muscle mass , Frieza claiming to have nearly doubled his power in this state . He also grows longer horns , which now instead of protruding sideways from his skull curve sharply upwards into near right angles . His armor can not contain his form and shatters , leaving him with a new , white natural armor covering his chest and shoulders . In this form , he somewhat resembles his father King Cold .
; Third form Frieza 's third form is again more brutish , with an extremely elongated skull . His facial features contort and change , with his nose melding into his mouth to form a crude beak . His original horns recede , and more now erupt in pairs along the length of his head . He walks and stands with a slight hunch , as if the strain of supporting his head was too much for even Frieza 's own body to bear . This form vaguely resembles a Xenomorph from the Alien movies .
; Final Form Drastically differing from his previous transformations , in his final form Frieza instead regresses , becoming shorter and less bulky , his horns and spikes disappear and his physique becomes streamlined . His skin becomes pure , solid white with purple sections on his head , shoulders , forearms , chest and shins .
Venus of Willendorf , also known as the Woman of Willendorf , is an 11.1 cm -LRB- 4 3\/8 inches -RRB- high statuette of a female figure . It was discovered in 1908 by archaeologist Josef Szombathy at a paleolithic site near Willendorf . Willendorf is a village in Lower Austria near the city of Krems . The statuette is made of a kind of limestone that can not be found in the area . It is colored with red ochre .
A study made in 1990 suggests that the figure was made between 24.000 and 22.000 BCE . Very little is known about its origin , how it was made , or what it meant to the people who made it .
The Venus is not a realistic portrait but rather an idealization of the female figure . Her vulva , breasts , and swollen belly are very pronounced . This suggests a strong connection to fertility . Her tiny arms are folded over her breasts , and she has no visible face . Her head is covered with what might be coils of braids , eyes , or a kind of headdress . The lack of a face has prompted some archaeologists and philosophers to view the Venus as a `` universal mother . ''
The nickname , urging a comparison of this rather obese figurine to the classical image of `` Venus '' , causes resistance in some modern analysis . `` The ironic identification of these figurines as ` Venus ' pleasantly satisfied certain assumptions at the time about the primitive , about women , and about taste , '' Christopher Witcombe has noticed . At the same time there is professional reluctance to identify her as an Earth Mother goddess of paleolithic Old Europe . Some suggest that her corpulence would represent high status in a hunter-gatherer society , and that beside her obvious fertility she could be an emblem of security and success .
The statue 's feet do not allow it to stand on its own . Due to this it has been speculated that it was meant to be held , rather than simply looked at .
Catherine McCoid and LeRoy McDermott think that the figurines were done as self portraits by the women themselves . Most scientists agree that the head , seen from a profile view , while having no distinct facial features , appears to be looking down . The common physical characteristics of all of the Venus figures are : a thin upper torso , largely exaggerated breasts , large buttocks and thighs , a large stomach -LRB- possibly due to pregnancy -RRB- , and oddly bent , short legs , that end with disproportionately small feet . Yet when looked upon as if you were a woman looking down at your body , the physical features , in perspective , seem correct . There are striking similarities between the Venus of Willendorf and a pregnant woman when perceived from above .
Venus of Willendorf is part of the collection of the Naturhistorisches Museum in Vienna .
Since this figure 's discovery and naming , several similar statuettes and other forms of art have been discovered . They are collectively referred to as Venus figurines .

Pierre Auguste Cot -LRB- 17 February 1837 â `` July 1883 -RRB- was a French painter . Today he is counted as being part of the Academic art movement . He is also known for his portraits . He studied painting in Toulouse and Paris . His teachers were LÃ on Cogniet , Alexandre Cabanel and William Bouguereau , amongst others . He won various prizes for his paintings , and in 1874 , he is made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour . He died at the age of 46 .
The Grand Duchy of Hesse was a former state that existed in modern-day Germany . It was formed in 1806 after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire as a result of the actions of Napoleon , who then elevated the former Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt to the level of grand duchy . For this reason , this state was occasionally known simply as Hesse-Darmstadt .
Because Hesse-Darmstadt was a member of Napoleon 's Confederation of the Rhine , it was forced to give up a considerable amount of territory at the 1815 Congress of Vienna . The territory of the Duchy of Westphalia , which Hesse-Darmstadt received from the 1803 Reichsdeputationshauptschluss , was given to the Kingdom of Prussia . However , it received some territory on the western bank of the Rhine , including the important federal fortress at Mainz .
The Grand Duchy changed its name to the Grand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine in 1816 .
The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols is a form of church service used at Christmas in the Anglican Church . There are nine lessons -LRB- readings -RRB- and between each reading there is a carol sung , either by the choir on its own or by the whole congregation . The story is told from the beginning of the Bible in which Adam disobeys God , to the coming of the baby Jesus .
The form of the service was started by Edward White Benson who was Bishop of Truro in Cornwall , for use on Christmas Eve -LRB- 24 December -RRB- 1880 . The service is now used by other churches all over the world , not just in Anglican churches , but also in some Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches . In the UK , the service has become the standard form for schools ' Christmas carol services .
The best-known Nine Lessons and Carols service is the one held in King 's College , Cambridge every Christmas . The choir carols are sung by the world-famous Choir of King 's College , Cambridge . This service has een broadcast on BBC television for more than half a century .
The first Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at King 's College , Cambridge , was held on Christmas Eve in 1918 . The music at the first service was directed by Arthur Henry Mann , who was the organist from 1876 to 1929 . The choir had 16 trebles which was the number that Henry VI said there must be when he founded the college . Until 1927 the men in the choir were choral scholars and lay clerks . Today , 14 undergraduates from the Choir of King 's College , Cambridge , sing the men 's parts .
The service was first broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1928 and , except for 1930 , has been broadcast every year since , even throughout World War II in spite of the stained glass having been removed from the Chapel and the lack of heating . The service is slightly different today : not all the readings are from the Bible . Most of the carols are sung by the choir . There are generally more than nine carols . The service starts with the famous carol `` Once in Royal David 's City '' . Verse one is always sung as an unaccompanied solo by one of the boys in the choir . The boy is not told that he is the one who has been chosen to sing the solo until just before the service begins .
Since 1982 the Director of Music has been Stephen Cleobury . Each year he commissions a composer to write a new carol for the Choir . The service ends with the carol `` O Come all ye faithful '' . This is followed by the Organ Voluntary : `` In Dulci Jubilo '' -LRB- BWV 729 -RRB- by Johann Sebastian Bach and then another Organ Piece -LRB- which is heard on the radio but not on television -RRB- .
In a shop , a fruit is any fleshy , sweet plant growth . In botany , a fruit is a plant structure that contains its seeds . The word fruit is used only if it comes from the part of the flower which was an ovary . It is an extra layer round the seeds , which may or may not be fleshy . However , even in botany , there is no general agreement on how fruits should be classified . Many do have extra layers from other parts of the flower .
Since fruits are produced from fertilised ovaries in flowers , only flowering plants produce fruits . Fruits are an evolutionary ` invention ' which help seeds get dispersed by animals .
The botanical term includes many that are not `` fruits '' in the common sense of the term . such as the vegetables squash , pumpkins , cucumbers , tomato , peas , beans , corn , eggplant , and sweet pepper and some spices , such as allspice and chillies .
An accessory fruit or false fruit -LRB- pseudocarp -RRB- is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue .
A fig is a type of accessory fruit called a syconium . Pomes , such as apples and pears , are also accessory fruits : the core is the true fruit .
Many fruits come from trees or bushes . For plants , fruits are a means of dispersal , usually by animals . When the fruit breaks apart , the seeds can go into the ground and begin to grow . Most fruits we eat contain a lot of water and natural sugars , and many are high in Vitamin C. They have a large amount of dietary fiber . Fruits are usually low in protein and fat content , but avocados and some nuts are exceptions to this . Not only humans , but our closest living relatives -LRB- primates -RRB- are keen fruit-eaters . So are many other groups of herbivorous mammals and many birds .
Seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce . Commercial bananas and pineapple are examples of seedless fruits . Some citrus fruits , especially oranges , satsumas , mandarin oranges , table grapes , grapefruit , and watermelons are valued for their seedlessness .
Seedless bananas and grapes are triploids , and seedlessness results from the abortion of the embryonic plant which is produced by fertilisation . The method requires normal pollination and fertilisation .

A psychoactive drug , psychopharmaceutical , or psychotropic is a chemical substance that crosses the blood-brain barrier . It action affects the central nervous system . It can affect the brain and change perception , mood , consciousness , cognition and behavior . Such substances can be taken for medical reasons . Sometimes they are also used in rituals , or as illegeal drugs . These drugs enable their users to change their consciousness . This can also help students when they are preparing their examinations . Certain therapies also use such subtances .
Psychoactive substances change the consciousness and mood of their user . The people using them may have pleasant feelings , such as euphoria or they may be more alert . For this reason , may psychoactive substances are abused : They are used outside the aims of the treatment . This may lead to the user developing a psychological and physical dependence -LRB- `` addiction '' -RRB- . It will get more difficult to interrupt the cycle of abuse . Drug rehabilitation aims to break this cycle of dependency ; this is done with psychotherapy , support groups and even other psychoactive substances : Acamprosate or naltrexone are examples of substances used to treat alcoholism , methadone or buprenorphine maintenance therapy in the case of opioid dependency . However , the reverse is also true in some cases , that is certain experiences on drugs may be so unfriendly and uncomforting that the user may never want to try the substance again . This is especially true of the deliriants -LRB- e.g. datura -RRB- and dissociatives -LRB- e.g. salvia divinorum -RRB- .
In part because of this potential for abuse and dependency , the ethics of drug use are the subject of a continuing philosophical debate . Many governments worldwide have placed restrictions on drug production and sales in an attempt to decrease drug abuse . Ethical concerns have also been raised about over-use of these drugs clinically , and about their marketing by manufacturers .

Andreas Bernd Baader -LRB- 6 May 1943-18 October 1977 -RRB- was born in Munich , Germany was a German terrorist .
He was one of the first leaders of the Baader-Meinhof gang , later it was called the Red Army Faction or RAF .
In 1968 , Baader and his girlfriend Gudrun Ensslin were convicted of the setting fire to a department store in Frankfurt am Main .
They were arrested and sent to jail , but Baader escaped . He was caught in April 1970 , but in May 1970 , he was allowed to go a library outside the prison .
Journalist Ulrike Meinhof and two other women were allowed to join him . They let a masked man into the library who fired shots at a 64-year-old librarian . Baader , the three women and the masked man fled through a window , and the group soon became known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang .
Baader and others then spent some time in a Palestinian military training camp in Jordan before being thrown out . Back in Germany , Baader robbed banks and bombed buildings from 1970 to 1972 .

The Sea of Japan or East sea is a sea in the western Pacific Ocean . It is between Korea to the west , Russia to the north and Japan to the east and south . Different countries have different names for the body of water . North Korea calls it East Korea Sea .
International Hydrographic Organization -LRB- IHO -RRB- decided to call this sea area `` Sea of Japan '' in 1929 .
Since 1992 , South Korea demands the world to use the names `` East Sea '' or `` Sea of Korea '' instead of `` Sea of Japan '' . South Korea argues that this sea area has been called `` East Sea '' since early times . It is also a Korean belief that the name `` East Sea '' was eliminated from the maps of the world in the early 20th century while South Korea was under the rule of Japan .
On the contrary , Japan says that the name `` Sea of Japan '' has been used more widely than `` East Sea '' in Europe and America since before the 18th century . Japan also points out that if there was no Japan , there would be no sea .
Nowdays many maps and documents include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea , often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name .

Goat Rock Beach is a beach in Sonoma County , California , United States . It is part of the Sonoma Coast State Beach , which is owned by the State of California . The mouth of the Russian River is located in the northern part of the beach . Goat Rock is located in the southern part of the beach . The beach itself was named after the rock . The naming of Goat Rock is unknown , but many sources say some goat herders around the early 20th century used the grassy , flat rock for goats , because few other animals could live there .
Goat Rock Beach has many visitors . It usually has the most people in the middle of summer . The beach is a popular spot for swimming and surfing . It is home to seagulls , harbor seals , and sea lions , as well as other animals from the Pacific Ocean .
The oldest natural history of the area is related to marks made by mammals in an area of rock about one third of a mile south of Goat Rock Beach . In uplifted sea stack formations , there are rubbing marks about two to four meters above the ground surface , too high of a rubbing mark for modern bovids . Mammoths are thought to have traveled here as recently as 40,000 years ago , and are thought to have made these rubbing marks . Mammoth fossils have been found at Bodega Head , which is a few miles south of Goat Rock Beach .
The earliest known humans to settle at Goat Rock Beach were the Native American Coast Miwok and Pomo tribes . During the mid-1800s , Mexican ranchers lived in California , and Goat Rock Beach was part of a Mexican land grant called the `` Bodega Rancho '' . The Russians are thought to have begun cutting down the forests just north of the beach in the early 19th century .
The Russian River , which has its mouth at the north end of Goat Rock Beach , is Sonoma County 's biggest watercourse and river . Just north of the Russian River mouth is the small town of Jenner , and the beach , Jenner Beach . Goat Rock is located at the south end of the beach . Visitors can walk onto Goat Rock , going on a small isthmus , which is also known as a land bridge . Blind Beach is just south of Goat Rock Beach , with only Goat Rock between the two beaches , and Goat Beach is southwest of it .
Goat Rock Beach has much marine erosion and erosion from the wind . This causes about one to three feet of land mass lost each year . Erosion is when water and wind remove the top layer of rock or mud . During big storms , there can be even more erosion .
The `` sea stacks '' -LRB- eroded parts of rock -RRB- along the Goat Rock Beach coast are rocks from the Franciscan Complex , rock formations which were made during earthquakes in California . About 200 years to 30 million years ago , the North American Plate collided with the Farallon Plate , causing earthquakes . Different rock types came from these collisions , including pillow basalt , chert , and sandstone . Goat Rock has a flat topped sea stack , made of greywacke . The rock formations -LRB- groups -RRB- are made of sandstone with layers of quartz .

`` Wild apple '' redirects here . In Australia , this may refer to the unrelated Pouteria eerwah .
Malus , the apples , is a genus of about 30 â `` 35 species of small deciduous trees or shrubs in the family Rosaceae . Other studies go as far as to say it includes 55 species including the domesticated Orchard Apple , or Table apple as it used to be called -LRB- M. domestica , derived from M. sieversii , syn . M. pumila -RRB- . The other species and subspecies are generally known as `` wild apples '' , `` crab apples '' , `` crabapples '' or `` crabs '' .
The genus is native to the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere , in Europe , Asia and North America .
Apple trees are small , usually 4 â `` 12 m tall when full grown . The leaves are 3 â `` 10 cm long , are positioned opposite from each other , have a simple shape , with a saw-tooth edge . The flowers come from corymbs , and have five petals , which may be white , pink or red , with usually red stamens that produce lots of pollen , and an ovary which is below them ; flowering takes place in the spring after 50 â `` 80 growing degree days -LRB- this varies a lot according to subspecies and cultivar -RRB- . Apples need to be pollinated from one tree to another by insects -LRB- typically bees , which freely visit the flowers for both nectar and pollen -RRB- ; all are unable to pollinate themselves , and -LRB- with the exception of a few specially developed cultivars -RRB- self-pollination is impossible , making pollinating insects required .
For Malus sylvestris domestica , see Apple . The fruit of the other species is not an important crop in most areas because they are very sour and -LRB- in some species -RRB- very like wood , and is rarely eaten raw for this reason . However , crabapples are an excellent source of pectin , and their juice can be made into a ruby-coloured jelly .
Crabapples are widely grown as trees for the pleasure of their appearance , grown for their beautiful flowers or fruit , with cultivars selected for these qualities and for resistance to disease .
Some crab apples are used as rootstocks for domestic apples to add characteristics .
They are also used as tree for pollinating food apple trees in apple orchards . Varieties of crab apple are selected to bloom at the same time as the apple trees in an orchard , and the crabs are planted every sixth or seventh tree , or limbs of a crab tree are grafted onto some of the apple trees . See also Fruit tree pollination .
Because of the many blossom and small sized fruit , crab apples are popular for use in bonsai . Because the trees are small due to the needs of the hobby , but still show the abundant fruit bearing of full sized crab apples , it is important to thin out fruit so that trees do not stress themselves .
Apple wood `` makes a wonderfully luxurious firewood with a lovely scent -LRB- smell -RRB- , and smoke from an apple wood fire gives a most excellent flavor to smoked foods , '' including Applewood cheese .

Orthography , or spelling , is the correct order and combination of letters put together to form words .
Spelling changes over time . At about the time of the Renaissance , words in English did not have a fixed spelling . Over time , however , different combinations of letters became more common , resulting in the more standard spellings of words we see today . Although spelling is not so important as vocabulary and usage , it is a traditional sign of education . Those who can not spell well may suffer discrimination .
Differences between American English and British English spelling came about mainly as the result of one man . Noah Webster -LRB- 1758 â `` 1843 -RRB- wrote a Grammar , a Spelling book , and finally an American dictionary of the English language . In the course of this , he proposed a number of simplifications in spelling . In his dictionary , he chose s over c in words like defense , he changed the re to er in words like center , he dropped one of the Ls in traveler . At first he kept the u in words like color or favor but dropped it in later editions . He also changed tongue to tung : that did not stick . His main reason was to help children learn to read and write . Webster 's dictionary contained seventy thousand words , of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before .
Webster did create a slightly different identity for American English . But , because his efforts left the most glaring problems untackled , his variations make little difference to the way the language is used . An example of the real problems in English orthography is the word ending - ough , which is pronounced several different ways : tough , bough , cough ... The root causes of spelling variation are historical , and loan words come with their own -LRB- foreign -RRB- spelling . Either all French loan words should be left as they were , or they all should be changed . Either we should move wholesale to a more phonetic spelling , or not . This was proposed by many people since Webster , such as George Bernard Shaw , who proposed a new phonetic alphabet for English . In some cases Webster 's changes have been widely adopted in Britain : the spelling program came from the French ; US program is clearly simpler , and more consistent with word endings in English . In our modern world , English orthography is still a problem . In some countries -LRB- notably , France -RRB- a national committee can give advice and direction as to spelling . English has long escaped from national custody .
Modern British spelling and use was greatly influenced by the two great English dictionaries , Samuel Johnson 's A dictionary of the English language -LRB- 1755 -RRB- , and James Murray 's Oxford English dictionary . Johnson 's dictionary was hugely influential , abroad as well as at home . The dictionary was exported to America . `` The American adoption of the Dictionary was a momentous event not just in its history , but in the history of lexicography . For Americans in the second half of the eighteenth century , Johnson was the authority on language , and the subsequent development of American dictionaries was colored by his fame '' . p224 For American lexicographers , the dictionary was impossible to ignore : `` America 's two great nineteenth-century lexicographers , Noah Webster and Joseph Emerson Worcester , argued fiercely over Johnson 's legacy ... In 1789 -LRB- Webster -RRB- declared that ` Great Britain , whose children we are , and whose language we speak , should no longer be our standard ; for the taste of her writers is already corrupted , and her language on the decline . ' ... Where Webster found fault with Johnson , Joseph Worcester saluted him ... In 1846 he completed his Universal and critical dictionary of the English Language . p226
Some people argue which language is the easiest to spell . People who learn a second language tend to think that their first -LRB- native -RRB- language is the easiest . However , for the learner , programmatic languages , with well-defined rules , are easier to start with than English . The spelling of the English language is by far the most irregular of all alphabetic spellings and thus the most difficult to learn . English is , in its origin , a Germanic language . From its early roots as Anglo-Saxon , it has borrowed words from many other languages : French -LRB- a Romance language -RRB- and Latin are the most frequent donors to English .
Languages that use phonetic spelling are easier to learn to spell than others . With phonetic spelling the words are spelled as they are pronounced . The Italian word `` orologio '' for instance is pronounced oh-ro-LO-jo -LRB- `` gi '' always making a `` j '' sound . -RRB- In English , one comes across the word `` knife '' . In `` knife '' , the `` k '' is not spoken , even though in English it 's more common to pronounce `` K `` s when they are in words .
One of the problems we have is that similar sounding words may be spelt quite differently . Rough and ruff ; meet and meat ; great and grate . Words with complicated spelling may be pronounced simply : Leicester is pronounced ` Lester ' . Even what rules we do have are frequently broken . `` i before e except after c '' has over 100 exceptions . p272 Almost all these problems have come about for historical reasons . English has been changing for the last thousand years , and as the language changes , so parts of it get stuck with different spellings .
1 . Originally a 23-letter alphabet for the 35 or so phonemes -LRB- sounds -RRB- of Old English . Other letters were added later .
2 . After the Norman conquest , French scribes introduced new spellings .
3 . Printing . Many of the early printers came from the continent of Europe , and brought other spelling norms to England . But , although print stabilised spelling , pronunciation continued to change .

Manchester United had a chance to be the first team ever to win the Champions League twice in a row if they had won the finals against Barcelona on the 27 May 2009 , but instead lost 0-2 in Rome . They beat Chelsea on penalties the year before in Moscow . Before the start of the Champions league in 1993 , many teams had won the earlier version called the European Cup . Teams such as Ajax and Bayern Munich won the cup three times in a row . Real Madrid won it the first five times it was held . This is the record . They have also won the Champions League\/European Cup nine times , which is also a record .
The 1st team ever which won the UEFA Champions League and all the other titles was Barcelona , after they have beat Manchester United 2-0 , but year later Inter had reproduced the amazing achievement , after they have beat Bayern Munich 2-0 . In 2011 Manchester Unitedbeat Barcelona at wembly stadium in England , this title added to their 19 premier league title a new record which stomped out liverpools earlier record of 18 .

The Snake River Plain is a valley in the U.S. state of Idaho . It covers most of the southern part of the state and is transected by the Snake River . The Snake River Plain was formed by magma rising up below the North American Plate . As the plate moved westward , the magma melted rock under the plate . This melting caused the surface to drop and form the Snake River Plain . Underneath the plain is the Snake River Aquifer . The aquifer is fed by the Snake River and its tributaries . Much of the soil in the Snake River Plain is fertile . As a result , today the primary human purpose of the plain is for agriculture .

Kenya 's coast is tropical and gets very hot . Inland , it is drier . The highest mountain in Kenya is Mt. Kenya -LRB- 5,199 m -RRB- .
Many different languages are spoken in Kenya . English is the official language and many people speak Kiswahili . Kiswahili is the National Language . All School going Kenyans are required to learn English . English is the language of instruction in the schools and institutions of higher learning .
Kenya was a British colony , but became independent on December 12 , 1963 . For many years , a single party , the Kenya African National Union -LRB- KANU -RRB- , ruled Kenya . Kenya has been a democratic country but from 1968 to 1992 it was a single party democracy . General elections were held every 5 years however all candidates for election to office had to belong to the ruling party KANU . Mwai Kibaki is currently the president of Kenya and is the first President of Kenya to belong to a party other than KANU . Since he became President he has achieved a lot and Kenya has seen economic growth spurts of up 6 % . He however has come under heavy criticism as some feel the reforms that were needed are slow to come . Many Kenyans living in Diaspora have began to return to Kenya as the promise of the future has created a plenty of high paying jobs that are appealing to foreign educated Kenyans .
All Kenyans of school going age are required to attend Primary School which is provided free by the government . The Kenyan school system consist of 8 years of Primary School , Standard 1 through 8 , 4 years of High School -LRB- Form 1 to 4 -RRB- and 4 years of University . At the end of Primary school , all students sit for a standardized exam called Kenya Certificate of Primary Education -LRB- KCPE -RRB- . The grades attained in this exam determine which High School the student will attend . In Form 4 -LRB- this is the last year in High School -RRB- , students sit for another exam called Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education -LRB- KCSE -RRB- . The highest achieving students are granted admission into the 5 National Universities -LRB- Nairobi , Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology , Kenyatta University , Egerton University and Moi University -RRB- . Tertiary colleges like Globovillee college also feeds diploma graduates to universities
Kenya is a country of grassland , but it is not rich , productive land . This is a very dry grassland with poor soil . Kenya also has very few mineral resources.Three-fourths of the country is covered with plains . They are low on altitude along the coast , but get higher further inland , making a large plateau . The part east of Lake Turkana is the only true desert , but the rest can be very close to desert . Savannas usually get between 4 and 16 inches -LRB- 100 to 400 mm -RRB- of rain in a year . These lands , however , are called savanna because of the type of plants that live there and how they get their rain . Savannas have a wet and dry season . During the wet season it can rain hard for long periods of time then not rain at all in the dry season . Savannas that have more rain often have many trees spaced out across their plains . These trees have deep roots or store water , like desert plants do , to live through the long , dry seasons without rain . Even drier savannas will have only grass , and that too only in a few clumps . The dry land is very bad for crops , but it is a wonderful place for all kinds of wild animals to gather and stay . That is why Kenya has a lot of parks where the animals are kept , and protected from all the hunters . People\/tourists come from all over the world to go on photo safaris in Kenya 's special parks . The people come to Kenya on safari to see animals such as the rhinoceros , giraffe , wildebeest , elephant , cheetah , antelope , and lion . These animals live on the savanna grasslands . The wild herbivores move as they eat , and the never stay in one spot because there is not enough grass for all of them . People also usually raise cattle on the savanna . These animals are kept in one place and often eat up all the grass there .
Since the independence of Kenya in 1963 , Kenya has usually had a one-party government and has been a member of the British Commonwealth . The people are , like the Congo , divided into many tribes that often fight . However , Kenya 's government is trying to get the people to work together and has encouraged them to run businesses and factories . Kenya is a developing country , slowly growing more modern .

Sturt National Park is a national park in north west New South Wales -LRB- Australia -RRB- , 1059 km northwest of Sydney . The park is named after the explorer , Charles Sturt , who traveled through the area in 1845 . The park was created in the 1970 's from six large sheep and cattle stations -LRB- farms -RRB- . These stations included Mount Wood , Olive Downs , Whitta Brinna , Mount King , Binerah Downs and Fort Grey .
The park is large , covering more than 340000 h of arid area . The east of the Sturt National Park has flood plains , some trees and small rocky gorges and creek beds . Lake Pinnaroo , near Fort Grey , is a Ramsar listed wetland .
The central area of the park , near the old Olive Downs sheep station , has `` jump-ups '' , flat topped mesas rising up to 150 m metres above the plains . In the far west of the National Park , the gibber -LRB- stone -RRB- plains are replaced by the red sand dunes of the Strezlecki Desert .
The Mount Wood Station used to cover 500000 a and had 86,000 sheep . It employed 100 people . The homestead buildings have been renovated and an outdoor farm museum has been started . The historic homestead built in 1884 , has been turned into a place for up to 15 tourists to stay , and the old shearer 's house can hold 38 people . There is also camping areas at Dead Horse Gully at Tibooburra , Olive Downs , Fort Grey and Mount Wood .

In Ancient Greece , the Gorgoneion -LRB- Greek : Î `` Î Ï Î Ï Î 1\/2 Î Î Î Î 1\/2 -RRB- was originally a magic pendant showing the Gorgon 's head . -LRB- The use of magic against evil , or bad luck is generally called Apotropaism -RRB- . The gorgoneion was linked with the gods Zeus and Athena ; both are said to have worn it as a pendant . It was also popular as a royal symbol , worn on shields and capes . These can be seen on the Alexander Mosaic and the Gonzaga Cameo .
Homer wrote about the Gorgon on four occasions , but only about the head , as if the creature had no body . Jane Ellen Harrison notes that `` Medusa is a head and nothing more ... a mask . '' The body was added many years later . Up to the 5th century BC , the head was shown as being very ugly , with her tongue sticking out , boar tusks , puffy cheeks , her eyeballs staring straight ahead and the snakes twisting all around her .
The direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient Greek art . . In some cases a beard , -LRB- probably representing streaks of blood -RRB- was added to her chin , making her appear as a wild and sexual god , like Dionysus .
Gorgoneia painted on the shields of warriors on mid-5th century Greek vases are not as ugly , strange or frightening . By that time , the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized . The Hellenistic marble known as the Medusa Rondanini shows how the Gorgon changed over time into a beautiful woman .
Gorgoneia are first seen in Greek art at the beginning of the 8th century BC . One of the earliest is on a coin found during an archaelogical dig at Parium . Other early 8th-century examples were found at Tiryns . There is a similar image from the Knossos palace , dating from the 15th century BC . Marija Gimbutas even argues that `` the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC , as a ceramic mask from the Sesklo culture illustrates '' .
In the 6th century BC , gorgoneia of a basic type of `` lion mask '' were found all over Greek temples , especially in and around Corinth . Pedimental gorgoneia were common in Sicily ; probably the earliest one is in the Temple of Apollo in Syracuse . Around 500 BC , they stopped being used to decorate monumental buildings , but were still shown on parts of the roof tiles -LRB- antefix -RRB- of smaller buildings throughout the next century .
As well as temples , the Gorgon image can be found on dress , dishes , weapons , and coins across the Mediterranean region from Etruria to the Black Sea coast . The Gorgon coins were made in 37 cities , making her image on coins second only to some of the main Greek gods . On mosaic floors , the gorgoneion was usually near the door , as if guarding it . On Attic kilns , a gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from accidents .
The Gorgon image remained popular even in Christian times , especially in the Byzantine Empire , including Kievan Rus -LRB- now the Ukraine -RRB- . The image was used in Western Europe by the Italian Renaissance artists . In the 20th century , the gorgoneion was used by Gianni Versace as a logo for his fashion company .
Gimbutas says the gorgoneia are part of of the Mother Goddess cult linked to `` dynamic life energy '' . She said the gorgoneion is a typical European image . Jane Ellen Harrison , on the other hand , claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks . These are meant to scare the owner from doing something wrong , or , as she terms it , to make an ugly face at him .

Edgar Degas -LRB- 19 July 1834 - 27 September 1917 -RRB- was an artist from France . He is famous for his paintings and sculptures . He is seen as one of the people who started Impressionism . .
He was born in Paris , France . He began to paint early in his life . Because his father wanted it , he went to university to become a lawyer in 1853 . Edgar did not like this , and he went to study at the Ã cole des Beaux-Arts , an important art-school in Paris in 1855 . In 1856 he traveled to Naples in Italy , he stayed there for 3 years . He studied famous painters like Michelangelo and Raphael and learned by copying their work .
In 1859 he came back to Paris . He started his first important painting The Bellelli Family , and also started on a few history paintings like Alexander and Bucephalus and The Daughter of Jephthah . In 1861 he visited Normandy and made his first drawings of horses which were an important subject for his paintings .
After the start of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 , Degas worked for the National Guard . He did not have time to paint . After the war he went to stay with his brother Rene in New Orleans , Louisiana . In 1873 he went back to Paris and in 1874 his father died . He then found out his brother had large business debts . Edgar had to sell the house and a collection of art he had inherited . He now had to depend on his paintings for his income . He created a lot of great paintings in next 10 years . With the money he earned , he bought paintings by painters he liked a lot . Examples are Manet , Paul CÃ zanne , Pissarro , Gauguin , Van Gogh and others .

An anthem is a piece of music written for a choir to sing at an Anglican church service . The difference between an anthem and a motet is that an anthem is sung in English . Also most anthems are accompanied by an organ .
The word â anthemâ has come to mean â a song of celebrationâ . This is why we also talk about National Anthems .
Anthems for the church have been composed ever since King Henry VIII argued with the Pope and did not want to be Roman Catholic any more . He founded -LRB- started -RRB- the English Anglican church . Church composers were told to write music in English . The words usually come from the Bible . We know that as early as 1502 the composer Fayrfax was paid 20 shillings for composing an anthem . After the Reformation many anthems were composed . At first they were like motets , but in English . Soon the English anthem developed differently from the continental motet . Two kinds of anthem developed : the â Full Anthemâ in which the whole anthem was sung by the full choir , and the â Verse Anthemâ which was usually longer and had several verses which would be sung by soloists , with choruses for the full choir in between .
Almost every music director of cathedrals or large churches has written anthems . A few of the most famous composers of anthems are :

Liquid scintillation counting is an analytical technique . It is used to measure radiation from beta -LRB- alpha -RRB- - emitting nuclides . It can also detect the auger electrons emitted from Chromium-51 -LRB- 51Cr -RRB- and Iodine-125 -LRB- 125I -RRB- samples . Samples of nuclides are dissolved or suspended in a `` cocktail '' . The `` cocktail '' is containing an aromatic solvent and small amounts of other additives known as fluors . Beta -LRB- alpha -RRB- particles emitted from the sample transfer energy to the solvent molecules . The molecules in turn transfer their energy to the fluors . The excited fluor molecules dissipate the energy by emitting light . Scintillation cocktails often contain additives that shift the wavelength of the emitted light . It makes it more easily detected .
The samples are placed in small transparent -LRB- often glass or plastic -RRB- vials . They are loaded into a liquid scintillation counter . The counter has two photomultiplier tubes . They are connected in a coincidence circuit . The coincidence circuit assures that genuine light pulses are counted . Counting efficiencies under ideal conditions is about 30 % for tritium . Tritium is a low-energy beta emitter . It is nearly 100 % for phosphorus-32 -LRB- 32P -RRB- . Phosporus is a high-energy beta emitter . Some chemical compounds and highly colored samples can interfere with the counting process . This interference is known as `` quenching '' . It can be overcome through data correction or through careful sample preparation . 32P can also be counted in a scintillation counter without the cocktail . This technique is known as Cherenkov counting . It relies on the Cherenkov radiation being detected directly by the photomultiplier tubes . Cherenkov counting in this experimental context is normally used for quick rough measurements .

Measles is an infectious disease , caused by a virus . People catch measles from other people . It is passed on in tiny drops of water when people breathe . People with measles have a sore throat , a fever , a cough , red eyes and a runny nose . They also have a bumpy red rash all over their body .
Measles is very infectious , which means it is easy to catch . If someone in a house has measles , it is very likely that other people in the house will also get it .

Teletubbies is a BBC BAFTA award-winning children 's television program , mostly made for toddlers , and produced from March 31 , 1997 , to January 5 , 2001 by Ragdoll Productions , with a total of 365 episodes . The show is about the adventures of Teletubbies Tinky Winky , who is purple , Dipsy , who is green , Laa-Laa , who is yellow , and Po , who is red .
It was created by Anne Wood and Andrew Davenport , who wrote each of the show 's 365 episodes . Narrated by Tim Whitnall , the show quickly became a success both with critics and with the public in Britain and other countries , and won its BAFTA in 1998 .
The show remained in production for three more years , and released a single , `` Teletubbies say `` Eh-oh ! '' '' , based on the show 's theme song , which reached number 1 in the UK Singles Chart in December 1997 and remained in the Top 75 for 32 weeks , selling over a million copies .
In the show , the four colorful Teletubbies play in the cheerful and fun Teletubbyland . They do things that little children like to do , such as rolling on the ground , laughing , running about , and watching real children on the televisions on their bellies . Mysterious pinwheels and telephones rise out of the meadow to show the days ' activities . The Sun , who has a baby 's face , makes baby noises during the show , and it rises and sets to begin and end the show . The land is covered with unusually talkative flowers and microphone-like `` voice trumpets '' . The only natural animals are rabbits -LRB- although birds are often heard -RRB- . The weather is always sunny and enjoyable except for some cloudy days , with rain and puddles , and snow at Christmas time . The Teletubbies are played by actors dressed in stuffy costumes , although the recording site is designed to give no sense of scale -LRB- weight -RRB- . The costumes sort of look like large spacesuits , although the Teletubbies appear not to wear real clothes . They are instead furry , and have pieces of cloth -LRB- `` screens '' -RRB- on their tubbies . This is where the name `` Teletubbies '' comes from . Tele is the British word for television , and tubby is the British word for stomach . These screens are used to switch into short movie sequences , which are generally repeated at least once . When the series is shown in different countries around the world , the movie clips are changed to fit the countries ' main audiences . -LRB- The British versions are the originals . -RRB-
The Teletubbies ' body shapes , actions , and ways of talking are similar to toddlers . The speed and design of the show was made by writer\/co-producer Andrew Davenport , who shaped the show to fit the attention spans of the target audience . The repeating of just about every word is familiar to everyone who has ever worked with young children . There was also help from Shatarra Willis the stage manager who helped the show to become a success . The Teletubbies speak in a baby-like language which is the subject of some controversy among educationalists , some of whom argue that this supposedly made-up talk is not good for children . -LRB- A similar complaint was made forty years previously about another children 's series , Flower Pot Men . -RRB-
The Teletubbies are at the stage of understanding speech but not yet fully capable of repeating it , exactly like their target audience . They often simply groan in anger in times where a human toddler would throw a tantrum . The Teletubbies ' catch-phrases are `` Eh-oh '' -LRB- hello -RRB- , as in : `` Eh-oh , Laa-Laa '' , to which Laa-Laa will respond , `` Eh-oh , -LRB- other Teletubby 's name -RRB- '' , `` Uh-oh '' , a common toddler response to anything that 's not good , `` Run away ! Run away ! '' , especially from Dipsy , and `` Bye-bye '' at least four times in a row . Laa-Laa , when flustered , will explode with `` Bibberly cheese ! '' , which is as angry as the Teletubbies get . But perhaps the most common exclamation is `` Big hug ! '' which one or more of the Teletubbies will call for during the course of an episode , resulting in a big group hug . Their diet is mainly of `` Tubby Tustard '' -LRB- which is sucked through a circular straw -RRB- and `` Tubby Toast '' . They are very messy eaters . In one episode , `` The Tubby Toaster '' , the machine that makes Tubby Toast went seriously wrong and filled the Teletubbies ' house with toast . Fortunately , one of their companions is Noo-Noo , a vacuum cleaner . Machines like Noo-Noo , the voice trumpets , and the televisions in the Teletubbies ' stomachs were designed to show small children , who are born into a world surrounded by strange and powerful electronic gadgets , that technology is benevolent and helpful , not something to be afraid of .
The Teletubbies ' landscape is an outdoor set located in rural Warwickshire , England , at Sweet Knowle Farm , Redhill Bank Rd , Whimpstone , CV37 8NR -LRB- between Stratford upon Avon and Shipston on Stour , close to the River Stour -RRB- . All the Teletubbies say `` Bye-Bye '' three times . The narrator bids each Teletubby goodbye , and they disappear , but reappear a moment later saying `` Boo ! '' . The narrator then says `` No '' , -LRB- which they copy -RRB- and proceeds to say goodbye to each Teletubby again . The sun is then shown setting , and the Teletubbies each say goodbye again , before jumping down a hole in the roof of their house . Finally , one Teletubby says goodbye a fourth time - they pop out of a hole in the house and say `` Bye-bye ! '' . For special episodes , and at the end of the `` Fun With The Teletubbies '' cassette , all four Teletubbies say `` Bye-bye '' in this way . Many of the occurrences of the show , including the end sequence , and the scene preceding the short film broadcast on a character 's tummy were shot only once , and the same scenes are used in each episode . A main feature of each episode is a radiant sun that has a picture of a smiling baby on it . The baby in the sun occasionally laughs out loud in short bursts . In 2001 , production of the show was canceled and it was announced that no new episodes would be produced . -LRB- However , BBC ran a few in-the-can episodes from mid 2001 to early 2002 . -RRB- However , the existing 365 episodes have been played in re-runs years for seven year until January 2008 .
Tinky Winky , -LRB- played by Dave Thompson , Mark Heenehan , and Simon Shelton -RRB- , is the first Teletubby . He is the largest of the Teletubbies , is purple , and has a triangular antenna on his head . He is notable for the red luggage -LRB- described by the show as a `` magic bag '' , but often described by other media as a handbag -RRB- he always carries . He is also found dancing in a ballet-style tutu from time to time , which is also often worn by Laa-Laa .
Dipsy -LRB- played by John Simmit -RRB- is the second Teletubby . He is green and is called `` Dipsy '' because his horn looks like a dipstick . He likes his black and white furry top hat , which he once lost . Laa-Laa found it , but instead of simply returning Dipsy 's hat to the stricken Dipsy , she ran around it for about ten minutes shouting `` Dipsy Hat ! Dipsy Hat ! '' . He is the most stubbon of the Teletubbies , and will sometimes refuse to go along with the other Teletubbies ' group opinion . His face is also notably darker than the rest of the Teletubbies .
Laa-Laa is the third Teletubby . She is yellow , has a curly antenna , and is concerned with the welfare of all . She is the best singer of all the teletubbies , and is a `` Drama queen '' , party-girl , and motherly type . Her favorite thing is a bouncy , orange ball , which is almost as big as she is .
Po is the red Teletubby . She is the fourth -LRB- and last -RRB- of the Teletubbbies , has an antenna that is shaped like a stick used for blowing soap bubbles , is the smallest of the Teletubbies , and is most often the one who always gets into trouble . She also says the word `` Eh-oh '' -LRB- hello -RRB- , a word used by all of Teletubbies .
Po 's favorite object is her scooter , which she calls `` scoota '' -LRB- she also calls it `` Po ` cooter ! '' , or just `` cooter '' -RRB- . Po often wants attention and can sometimes be mischievous and naughty when she disobeys the commands of the `` voice trumpets '' .
Po is bilingual , meaning she can speak more than one language . Those languages are English -LRB- the broadcasting country 's language -RRB- and Cantonese . She is a problem solver and the best `` spider-fighter '' . She is also a Tomboy type , and of all the Teletubbies , Po usually becomes most involved with the audience . She loves both attention and her curly red circular aerial on her head .
In the Teletubbies ' house , she sleeps at the side of all the other Teletubbies and sometimes eats Tubby Toast while the others are sleeping . She is voiced by Pui Fan Lee , which is why she can speak in dual languages .
A girl 's talking Po doll was thought to be saying `` faggot faggot , faggot faggot , faggot faggot , bite my butt ! '' , as well as `` fatty , fatty '' . -LRB- Supporters of the interpretation of Tinky Winky as gay pride symbol might take this as evidence . -RRB- The toy was recalled and it was revealed to have said `` fidit , fidit , '' inspired by the Cantonese for `` faster , faster . ''
Although many are unsure of Po 's gender , or think she is male -LRB- probably because of her scarlet -LRB- red -RRB- color and tomboyish antics -RRB- , she is clearly said to be female in several episodes , such as `` Dad 's Portrait '' -LRB- Episode 216 , first broadcast 1998 -RRB- and `` Numbers : 2 '' -LRB- Episode 30 -RRB- . Many refer to her as `` he '' even though it is `` she '' -LRB- the same happens with Laa-Laa -RRB- .
The show also features the voices of Toyah Willcox and Eric Sykes , and occasionally Sandra Dickinson and Penelope Keith , all of whom provide narration . The only physical cast member is Tamzin Griffin , who plays the manic `` Funny Lady '' . The Sun is personified with the face of baby Jessica Smith , who is believed to have been around seven months old at the time of filming . Her giggle was included in the single Teletubbies Say Eh-Oh ! . Although not credited , this makes her technically the youngest person ever whose vocal appeared on a number one song .
Tinky Winky started a still talked-about controversy in 1999 due to his carrying a bag that looks like a woman 's handbag , -LRB- although he was first called gay by the academic and cultural critic Andy Medhurst in a letter of July 1997 to The Face -RRB- , and gained the interest of Jerry Falwell in 1997 when Fallwell said that the character was a `` gay role model '' -LRB- an example of a `` gay '' person -RRB- . Falwell wrote about it in his National Liberty Journal . He said that in the Washington Post `` In\/Out '' column someone had written that lesbian comedian Ellen DeGeneres was `` out '' , or uncloseted , as the main gay model , while the fashionable Tinky Winky was `` in '' , or closeted . Falwell said it was because of the Teletubby 's purple color , the `` purse '' , and the triangle antenna which all represented homosexuality . This has caused many Christians to boycott Teletubbies because it makes them think that Teletubbies support homosexuality . Also , Tinky Winky dances in a tu-tu , which supporters of the thought that Tinky Winky is gay may take as evidence . A February 1999 article in the National Liberty Journal , published by evangelical pastor Jerry Falwell , warned parents that Tinky Winky could be a hidden homosexual symbol , because `` he is purple , the gay pride color , and his antenna is shaped like a triangle , the gay pride symbol '' . A spokesman for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co. , who licenses the characters in the United States , said that it was just a magic bag . `` The fact that he carries a magic bag does n't make him a homosexual . It 's a children 's show , folks . To think we would be putting sexual innuendo in a children 's show is kind of outlandish '' , he added . In an unrelated incident reported in 2000 , a girl 's Tinky Winky toy reportedly said `` I got a gun '' . Kenn Viselman , then chairman of the Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Company , said the toy was actually saying `` Again , again ! '' , a catchphrase from the show .
Teletubbies has been broadcast in many different countries , thus involving a foreign title .
Lake Vostok is the biggest of the seventy lakes in Antarctica that are under the ice . It is at 77 Â S 105 Â E and it is under Russia 's Vostok Station . It is also 4000 meters -LRB- 13,000 feet -RRB- under Antarctica 's surface .
The lake was found by Russian and British scientists . They used an object called a radar to find it .
The lake consists of fresh water . The temperature of the water is about -3 Â C. The freezing point of water is at 0 C , but the water in the lake remains liquid because of the high pressure of the ice .
There are two separate basins in the lake . These are separated by a ridge . It has been suggested that the ecosystems of the two basins are different .
Lake Vostok is an oligotrophic extreme environment . It is supersaturated with oxygen . The levels of oxygen are fifty times higher than those typically found in ordinary freshwater lakes on Earth . The weight of the ice on top of lake Vostok is believed to add to the high concentration of oxygen . Oxygen from the ice gets dis-solved into the water of the lake . Deposits of oxygen and other gases are trapped in the lake as well . The structure that traps them is called a clathrate . Gases trapped in clathrates are enclosed in ice , they look like packed snow . These structures form at the high-pressure depths of Lake Vostok ; they would become unstable if brought to the surface .
No other natural environment on earth is as rich in oxygen . For this reason , if there are any forms of life in the lake , these would probably need to have adapted to the high levels of oxygen , to be able to survive there . Some adaptations might include high concentrations of protective enzymes .
The environment in the lake is very similar to that on Jupiter 's moon Europa or Saturn 's moon Enceladus . Finding life in the lake would therefore make it more probable that life has existed on one of these moons .

A cult is a religious group of people . It is often a small , newly started religious movement . Cults have beliefs or practices that many people think of as being odd , or that have practices that most people in the world do not practice .
Whether a religious group is or is not a cult is a difficult problem . Personal opinions may change over time . What is at one point in time considered a cult may later be accepted as a religion and what at one point of time is considered an accepted religion may later become a cult .
In order to determine therefore whether a specific religious group is as a cult , an absolute criteria for truth needs to be used to measure the doctrines and beliefs of the group against .

Debian is a free operating system which is the Linux kernel -LRB- the core of Linux itself -RRB- and application software run on its kernel . Much of the application and utility software was done by the GNU project , so Debian Linux is more correctly called `` Debian GNU\/Linux '' . It is one of the most complete and popular Linux distributions , on which many others , like Ubuntu , are based upon .
The Debian Project officially started on August 16th , 1993 , led by Ian Murdock . He is a computer programmer . Today , in this project , Debian is developed by more than 1,000 computer specialists all over the world .
The name `` Debian '' was taken after Ian Murdock and his wife Debra . Some people say or pronounce ` deb-ee-n ' but others also say ` de-bi-an ' or ` de-bai-an ' and in Japan ` de-bi-a-n ' and so on .
Software packages in development are either uploaded to the project distribution named unstable -LRB- also known as sid -RRB- , or to the experimental repository . Software packages uploaded to unstable are normally versions stable enough to be released by the original upstream developer , but with the added Debian-specific packaging and other modifications introduced by Debian developers . These additions may be new and untested . Software not ready yet for the unstable distribution is typically placed in the experimental repository .
After a version of a software package has remained in unstable for a certain length of time -LRB- depending on how urgent the changes are -RRB- , that package is automatically moved to the testing distribution . The package 's move to testing happens only if no serious -LRB- release-critical -RRB- bugs in the package are reported and if other software needed for package functionality qualifies for inclusion in testing .
Since updates to Debian software packages between official releases do not contain new features , some choose to use the testing and unstable distributions for their newer packages . However , these distributions are less tested than stable , and unstable does not receive timely security updates . In particular , incautious upgrades to working unstable packages can sometimes seriously break software functionality . Since September 9 , 2005 the testing distributions security updates have been provided by the testing security team .
After the packages in testing have matured and the goals for the next release are met , the testing distribution becomes the next stable release . The latest stable release of Debian -LRB- Squeeze -RRB- is 6.0 , released on February 6 , 2011 . The next release is codenamed `` Wheezy '' .
Due to an incident involving a CD vendor who made an unofficial and broken release labeled 1.0 , an official 1.0 release was never made .

Metriacanthosaurus is a genus of theropod dinosaur that lived in Europe during the Middle Jurassic period , about 160 million years ago . Its name means `` Moderate-spined lizard '' , because its back vertebrae are taller than other meat-eating dinosaurs such as Allosaurus , but shorter than those of other meat-eating dinosaurs , such as Acrocanthosaurus . Like most theropods , Metriacanthosaurus was a meat-eater . It had three fingers on each hand . Each finger ended in a sharp , hook-like claw that was used to grab prey before giving the killing bite with its jaws . It probably preyed on the large , long-necked sauropods , such as Pelorosaurus , that lived in the same time and place as it . It was originally classified as a megalosaurid , but recent studies show that it belongs to its own family , the Metriacanthosauridae In Jurassic Park , one of the vials of dinosaur DNA that Dennis Nedry steals is labeled Metriacanthosaurus .

Overtures usually have tunes which are going to be heard during the opera or ballet . In this way it prepares the audience for what is to come .
Many overtures in the 18th century were simply background music to get the audience 's attention -LRB- people used to chatter during performances -RRB- . Some composers like Gioacchino Rossini -LRB- 1792-1868 -RRB- used the same overture again and again for his next operas , or just changed bits of it .
Composers like Christoph Willibald Gluck and later Richard Wagner -LRB- 1813-1883 -RRB- were very careful to make the overture a dramatic beginning which prepared the audience for the story . Wagner often called his overtures `` Vorspiel '' -LRB- Prelude -RRB- .
Not all composers wrote overtures to their operas . Giuseppe Verdi -LRB- 1813-1901 -RRB- and Giacomo Puccini -LRB- 1858-1924 -RRB- often go straight into the first act or they just have a very short prelude .
In the 19th century many Romantic composers wrote concert overtures . These pieces did not belong to any opera or ballet , they were just written to be heard at concerts . They often had a descriptive title because they told some sort of story e.g. Felix Mendelssohn -LRB- 1809-1847 -RRB- wrote an overture `` Fingal 's Cave '' which describes the sea coming into the cave in the Hebrides islands . Sometimes these descriptive pieces were much longer than an overture -LRB- which is usually just a few minutes -RRB- , so they were called tone poems .

This entry is not about King Ahaziah of Judah . Ahaziah or Ochozias -LRB- -- -- '' '' -RRB- -LRB- Israel , ca . 870 BC -- ca . 850 BC -RRB- was king of Israel and the son of Ahab and Jezebel . In the Bible , it says that he is very bad , and that he walked in the ways of his evil father King Ahab .
Ahaziah son of Ahab was king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah , and he reigned over Israel two years . He `` did evil in the eyes of the LORD , because he walked in the ways of his father and mother and in the ways of Jeroboam son of Nebat , who caused Israel to sin . He served and worshiped Baal and provoked the LORD , the God of Israel to anger , just as his father had done '' -LRB- 1 Kings 22:51 - 53 -RRB- .
After Ahab 's death , Moab rebeled from Israel , and Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in Samaria and injured himself . So he sent messengers , saying to them , `` Go and consult Baal-Zebub , the god of Ekron , to see if I will recover from this injury . '' But God was angry at this , because Ahaziah did not consult him , but only a god of Ekron , so on the way , Elijah went and met the servants , and told them -LRB- 2 Kings 1:6 -RRB- as the Lord had instructed him , `` Go back to the king who sent you and tell him , ` This is what the Lord says : Is it because there was no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal-Zebub , the god of Ekron ? Therefore -LRB- Because of this -RRB- you will not leave the bed you are lying on . You will certainly -LRB- surely -RRB- die ! ' '' And the messengers did has he was told . At King Ahaziah 's questions , they described Elijah as `` a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist '' . King Ahaziah recognized him at once , and sent a captain with fifty men to call Elijah . Now Elijah was sitting on a hill , and the captain called out , `` Man of God , the king says , ` Come down ! ' '' but Elijah replied , `` If I am a man of God , may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men ! '' he did like this the second time , too . Finally , the king sent a third captain with his fifty men , who '' ... fell on his knees before Elijah ... '' and bowed before him , humbly asking him to come . Elijah was told by the angel of the Lord to go down , so he went down and told the king again , `` You will certainly die ! '' `` So he died , according to the word of the Lord that Elijah had spoken '' . -LRB- 2 Kings 1:17 , NIV -RRB- And , according to the Bible , Ahaziah fulfilled the prophecy by dying . Because Ahaziah had no son , Joram became king .

Kwanzaa is a weeklong celebration held in the United States to honor universal African heritage and culture . People light a kinara -LRB- candle holder with seven candles -RRB- and give eachother gifts . It takes place from December 26 to January 1 every year . It was created by Maulana Karenga and was first celebrated in 1966 - 1967 . Non-African Americans also celebrate Kwanzaa . The holiday greeting is `` Joyous Kwanzaa '' .
Kwanzaa is a celebration that started in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s . It was created as a way to help African Americans reconnect with their African cultural and historical heritage .
The name Kwanzaa comes from the Swahili phrase matunda ya kwanza , meaning first fruits of the harvest .
During the early years of Kwanzaa , Karenga said that it was meant to be an alternative to Christmas , that Jesus was psychotic , and that Christianity was a white religion that black people should shun . However , as Kwanzaa became more popular , Karenga changed his position so that practicing Christians could also feel included . He stated in the 1997 Kwanzaa : A Celebration of Family , Community , and Culture , `` Kwanzaa was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday . ''
Many Christian African Americans who celebrate Kwanzaa do so in addition to observing Christmas .
Kwanzaa celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of Kwanzaa , or Nguzo Saba -LRB- originally Nguzu Sabaâ '' the seven principles of blackness -RRB- . Karenga said that this `` is a communitarian African philosophy , '' . It consists of what Karenga called `` the best of African thought and practice in constant exchange with the world . '' These seven principles comprise Kawaida , a Swahili term for tradition and reason . Each of the seven days of Kwanzaa is dedicated to one of the following principles , as follows :
Kwanzaa symbols include a decorative mat on which other symbols are placed , corn and other crops , a candle holder with seven candles , called a kinara , a communal cup for pouring libations , gifts , a poster of the seven principles , and a black , red , and green flag . The symbols were designed to convey the seven principles .
During Kwanzaa , families also decorate their households with objects of art . They use colorful African cloth such as kente , especially the wearing of kaftans by women . Fresh fruits that represent African idealism are also used . It is normal to include children in Kwanzaa ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors . Libations are shared , generally with a common chalice -LRB- a shared cup -RRB- , Kikombe cha Umoja , passed around to all people present . A Kwanzaa ceremony may include drumming and musical selections , libations , a reading of the African Pledge and the Principles of Blackness , reflection on the Pan-African colors , a discussion of the African principle of the day or a chapter in African history , a candle-lighting ritual , artistic performance , and , finally , a feast -LRB- Karamu -RRB- . The greeting for each day of Kwanzaa is Habari Gani ? which is Swahili for `` What 's the News ? ''

The Isle of Man Government is the executive and proposes laws to the legislature , Tynwald . Laws passed by Tynwald are given royal approval by the Lieutenant Governor unless the British Minister of Justice says they do not help the good government of the island .
The Isle of Man is an island in the Irish Sea , it is located northwest of the European continent . It is located between the United Kingdom and Ireland . The island is 13 km wide and 24 km long , it has a total area of 572 kmÂ . The Isle of Man has a total of 160 km of coastline , it has no important bodies of water . Apart from the island itself , the Isle of Man also includes some nearby islands . The most important of these islands are called Calf of Man , St Patrick 's Ilse and St Michael 's Isle .

The geology of Man is notable for the Iapetus Suture , which runs almost unseen right through the rocks of the island . The suture is the remnant of a once huge oocean , the Iapetus Ocean , which was lost about 420 million yeaars ago as three continents came together .
The Isle of Man became separated from Ireland and the British Isles about 8500 years ago . The short period of time between the melting of glaciers and the rise of sea level allowed a small number of species to colonize the island by land . The island was heavily deforested in the Middle Ages , this weakened the island 's environment . Some land is now protected by the government to help preserve its wildlife . Curraghs Wildlife Park , located in the wetlands , is home many species of animals and plants . The island is also home to a large number of bird species .

Curraghs are protected by the Government of the Isle of Man . Curraghs Wildlife Park is located in these wetlands , it is both a zoo and a protected area . During the winter , curraghs are the second largest nesting ground of the Hen Herrier in Europe . The Peregrine Falcon , Merlin , European Robin , Willow Warbler , Song Thrush , Dunnock , Swan and a subspecies of Winter Wren possibly native to the island also nest in the curraghs . The Chough is also found in the Isle of Man , it is more common than in other parts of Europe . Some farming methods have decreased the bird population of the island .

Love is the feeling of liking somebody or something very much .
Love usually has something to do with the chemical reactions in the brain . The feeling when somebody falls in love is also the feeling when someone eats chocolate .
There are many kinds of love . There can be self-love , love towards a friend , love in romance , towards family , toward God , or towards an object or idea .
Often love can be confused with other feelings . Being sexually or physically attracted is the feeling of lust , and most people do not think it is love . Besides that , normal friendship can be distracted by love . Sometimes , love can be destroyed . When love is destroyed between a dating couple , they may break up with each other .
Love is based on respect , understanding , and being able to talk with each other .
People describe the person that they first loved romantically as their `` first love . '' For example , in William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet , Romeo is Juliet 's very first love . At that time , she was only 13 . In Maria Edgeworth 's book Belinda , Mr. Vincent says , `` First loves are silly things . ''
The Biological model of sex is different from love because it is more like hunger or thirst . Helen Fisher , an expert in the topic of love , divides love into three stages : lust , attraction , and attachment . Lust makes people like each other , romantic attraction encourages people to focus on mating , and attachment helps people tolerate the spouse -LRB- or the child -RRB- .
Lust is the passionate sexual desire that promotes mating . This usually lasts only a few weeks or months . Attraction is more for one person specially . Recent studies in neuroscience say that as people fall in love , the brain releases chemicals , including dopamine . These chemicals make people less hungry and sleepy , and also adds an intense feeling of excitement . Research shows that this stage normally lasts from one and a half to three years .
Since these lust and attraction stages are both described as temporary , a third stage might describe long-term love . Attachment can be used to describe the bonding period that helps keep spouse and spouse together for many years . Attachment occurs in the longer term .
Love has consequences for health and well-being . Joyful activities such as love activate areas in the brain responsible for emotion , attention , motivation and memory , and it may further lead to stress reduction .

Aang and friends visit the Southern Air Temple where the Avatar learns that he was in the ice for 100 years and the Fire Nation killed all the airbenders . It was there Aang meets up with the only known remaining `` flying lemur '' , naming it `` Momo '' as it joins Aang 's group .
Arriving in a small town of Earth Kingdom that is controlled by the Fire Nation , Aang 's group are arrested while helping a boy named Haru .

The Test of English as a Foreign Language , or TOEFL , is a test which measures peopleâ s English language skills to see if they are good enough to take a course at university or graduate school in English-speaking countries . It is for people whose native language is not English . It measures how well a person uses listening , reading , speaking and writing skills to perform academic tasks . This test is accepted by more than 7,500 colleges , universities , and agencies in more than 130 countries ; which means it is most widely recognized English test in the world .
The format of TOEFL test has been changed three times . The first was the PBT -LRB- Paper-based TOEFL test -RRB- . It tests listening , reading and grammar skills with perfect sore , 677 . Some centers where computers are not available still offer this format . The second format is CBT -LRB- computer-based TOEFL test -RRB- . People are each provided with a computer to take the test .

A cutscene is a time in a video game where the game stops and the player watches something happen .
Usually cutscenes tell part of the story , such as showing characters talking or having a narrator say what is going on . Sometimes , however , a cutscene just shows something that is happening in the game , like a boss showing up , a ship taking off , or a building falling down .
There are many different types of cutscene . Some cutscenes are very simple and just show pictures with text like a slideshow . Others may be animated like a cartoon . Sometimes the cutscene appears directly in the game engine .
Many new games use prerendered scenes , meaning that the scene was created when the game was made and saved as a video file . Prerendered videos are sometimes just saved movies of things recorded in the game engine , but some use Computer-generated imagery -LRB- CGI -RRB- , which is separately made 3D graphics which are usually fancier than the game 's normal graphics . Prerendered scenes with CGI are often used for a game 's intro video .
A few games use live-action video footage , which is filmed like a movie or television show . Sometimes live-action footage will be used together with CGI .
Michel de Nostredame -LRB- December 14 or December 21 , 1503 â `` July 2 , 1566 -RRB- , also known as Nostradamus , was a French apothecary and allegedly a doctor . He is famous as a ` seer ' who wrote collections of prophecies that have since become famous around the world . His best known book was called Les Propheties -LRB- The Prophecies -RRB- and first appeared in 1555 . Since its first publication the book has rarely been out of print . Over the years , many people have come to believe that Nostradamus predicted a range of events in history . People often reached this conclusion by applying methods similar to the Bible code - i.e. by twisting the texts in such a way as to suggest that they predicted the future .
Most academics say that these associations between Nostradamus ' quatrains and world events are the result of misinterpretations , or bad translations , that are so far-fetched that they are useless as a source of genuine prediction . What is more , no interpretation has yet managed to predict any event before it happened .
Some people have written prophecies that were wrongly assumed to be by Nostradamus . For example , in 1997 a college student in Canada wrote an essay that included a fake English quatrain -LRB- a four-line verse -RRB- written in the same style that Nostradamus used in French . The quatrain ended up on the Internet , where it was soon assumed that it was a verse by Nostradamus himself predicting the events of 9\/11 . So many people e-mailed it to their friends , thinking that it was by Nostradamus , that the associated websites and discussion forums were soon overwhelmed .

This closed the gaps between the cars , meaning they were now racing very close together . This allowed Fernando Alonso , who was in 15th place to pass the slower less experienced drivers around him . Alonso went on to win race . After Renualt fired Piquet Jnr for his poor driving in 2009 , He told the FIA -LRB- the organization that run the Formula 1 World Championship -RRB- That Flavio Briatore , the Boss of the Renualt F1 Team -LRB- Who had been the boss for 20 years , and had cheated previously -RRB- had told him over the radio to crash the car deliberately , in order to bring the saftey car out and give Alonso a better chance .

Another possible reason for the name was as a mark of thankfulness for the help given during the famine in Crimea by the American Relief Administration under President Herbert Hoover .
In 1986 , believing that the asteroid was of S-type and that it had a diameter of 15 km , the length of 916 America 's day was thought to be 38 hours . Observations by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite have since shown that it has a diameter of 33.2 Â 1.3 km , with an absolute magnitude of 11.20 and an albedo -LRB- the extent to which it reflects light -RRB- of 0.053 Â 0.004 .

On the south side of the bridge are Southwark Cathedral and London Bridge station . On the north side are the Monument to the Great Fire of London and Monument tube station .
It was the only bridge over the Thames downstream from Kingston until Putney Bridge opened in 1729 . The current bridge opened on 17 March 1973 and is the latest in a succession of bridges to occupy the spot and claim the name .
The bridge carries part of the A3 road , which is maintained by the Greater London Authority ; the bridge itself is owned and maintained by a charity overseen by the City of London Corporation .
The name London Bridge is often mistakenly applied to Tower Bridge , which is the next bridge downstream .
A bridge has existed at or near the present site over the period from the Roman occupation of the area , nearly 2,000 years ago . The first bridge across the Thames in the London area , probably a military pontoon bridge , was built of wood by the Romans on the present site around 50 AD .
Around 55 AD , a piled bridge was constructed , and the local Britons built a small trading settlement next to itâ '' the town of Londinium . The settlement and the bridge were destroyed in a revolt led by Queen Boudicca in 60 AD . The victory was short-lived , and soon afterwards the Romans defeated the rebels and set about building a new walled town . Some of the 2nd-century Roman wall has survived to this day . The new town and bridge were built around the position of the present bridge , providing access to the south-coast ports via Stane Street -LRB- the A3 route -RRB- and Watling Street -LRB- the A2 -RRB- .
The southern gatehouse , the Stone Gateway , became the scene of one of London 's most notorious sights : a display of the severed heads of traitors , stuck on pikes and dipped in tar to preserve them . The head of William Wallace was the first to appear on the gate , in 1305 , starting a tradition that was to continue for another 355 years . Other famous heads on pikes included those of Jack Cade in 1450 , Thomas More in 1535 , Bishop John Fisher in the same year , and Thomas Cromwell in 1540 . In 1598 a German visitor to London counted over 30 heads on the bridge : `` On the south is a bridge of stone eight hundred feet in length , of wonderful work ; it is supported upon twenty piers of square stone , sixty feet high and thirty broad , joined by arches of about twenty feet diameter . The whole is covered on each side with houses so disposed as to have the appearance of a continued street , not at all of a bridge . Upon this is built a tower , on whose top the heads of such as have been executed for high treason are placed on iron spikes : we counted above thirty '' . The practice was finally stopped in 1660 . The mediaeval bridge itself was demolished in 1831 , and replaced by the 19th century bridge . This bridge was sold in 1968 , and replaced by the modern bridge .

The Mydoom virus -LRB- also known as a worm and as Win32 . Mydoom .  The worm was spread through mass emailing , disguise as badly sent email .
The virus was made to be sent in an email with an attachment that carried the virus . When the attachment was opened , the virus would download itself to the computer . The virus can only affect Windows based computers . The virus came with a package that would spam the SCO Group website . SCO had caused arguments within the Linux community for getting copyrights in some open source software . However , only 25 % of the infected computers would launch the attack . After the virus has been downloaded , it leaves the computer open to other malware by leaving a `` backdoor '' open .
Another type of the virus , Mydoom . B , was made to spam Microsoft . It was first found on January 28 , 2004 .
The virus was found to be a threat on January 26 , 2004 . The virus quickly spread and proved a threat to the SCO group . To try and get the public to catch the maker of the virus , the SCO group offered $ 250,000 U.S. dollars as a reward for catching the creator . Another type of the virus , Mydoom . B was found on January 28 . Because it was made to attack the Microsoft web site , Microsoft offered a $ 250,000 U.S. dollar reward if the maker of the virus was caught .

A triode is a type of vacuum tube . It differs from a vacuum tube diode , which has only two electrodes , by having a third electrode , called the grid between the cathode and anode .
When the cathode is heated , it gives out electrons . Then , the anode absorbs electrons . This process makes an electric current , which is controlled by the grid . The addition of the grid allows the triode to be used as an amplifier .
Lee De Forest invented this device in 1908 from his original two-electrode Audion of 1906 . The triode incorporates the key principle of amplification . The name triode emerged because people needed to distinguish it from other similar vacuum tubes -LRB- for example , diodes , tetrodes , pentodes , etc. -RRB-
The triode can not only do amplification but also work as part of an oscillator -LRB- making waves -RRB- and detecting waves . It is used in radios , but the transistor has mostly replaced it starting in the 1960s . It is an ancestor of the transistor . It is still used in vacuum tube amplifiers .

Afrotheria is a group of mammals -LRB- a superorder or cohort -RRB- , containing the golden moles , elephant shrews , tenrecs , aardvarks , hyraxes , elephants and manatees . Scientists made this group based on DNA analyses . Experiments in the 1990s have named Afrotheria as one of four major groups in the group Eutheria -LRB- containing placental mammals -RRB- . Afrotheria means `` African animals '' , `` afro '' for Africa and `` theria '' for animals . Many animals in the group seem to be at a high risk of extinction . If the scientists are correct in grouping the animals in afrotheria together , this would be a huge loss of different animals in the same group .
Some scientists do not agree with grouping the animals in afrotheria together .

Peter Waldo , Valdo , or Waldes -LRB- c. 1140 -- c. 1218 -RRB- , also Pierre VaudÃ s or de Vaux , is believed by many to have started the Waldensians . This was a Christian spiritual movement of the Middle Ages . People are still alive in southern Europe who come from this movement . Because not much was written down about Waldo while he was alive , people do not agree how important he was to the Waldensians , because it may have been around before his leadership . Also , the French historian Thuanus thought Waldo died in the year 1179 .
Not know many details are known about the life of Waldo . Some sources say that he was a rich man who sold clothes , and that he was a merchant from Lyon . Also , sources say that he had some education . Sometime not long before the year 1160 he was inspired by some events . One of these was hearing a sermon on the life of St. Alexius . Another was when saying that one did not believe in transubstantiation -LRB- which is the belief that , during Communion , the bread and wine turn into the body and blood of Jesus Christ -RRB- became a crime for which one could be punished by death . A third event was the sudden death of a friend during an evening meal . After this , he began living a radical Christian life . He gave his property to his wife . He gave the rest of his things to the poor .
At about this time , Waldo began to preach and teach publicly about his ideas of living simple lives and about poverty . He taught that `` No man can serve two masters , God and mammon '' , and strongly criticized things done by the Papal and things taught by the Roman Catholic Church . Some of the things taught by the Catholic Church that he criticized were purgatory and transubstantiation . He said that the Roman Catholic Church was the prostitute from the book of Revelation . By 1170 , many people were following him . These people were called the Poor of Lyon , the Poor of Lombardy , or the Poor of God who would spread their teaching abroad while dressed up as peddlers . Often called the Waldensians -LRB- or Waldenses -RRB- , they were different from the Albigensians or Cathari .
The Waldensian movement had lay preaching -LRB- people who were not preachers or priests for a living preached -RRB- , people who were poor by choice , and strictly obeying the Bible . Between 1175-1185 , Waldo either had a cleric from Lyons translate the New Testament of the Bible into the language that most people spoke , the Arpitan -LRB- Franco-Proven Ã al -RRB- language , or translate it himself .
In 1179 , Waldo and one of his followers went to Rome , where they were welcomed by Pope Alexander III , and the Roman Curia . They had to explain what they believed in front of a panel of three clergymen , including issues which were then debated within the Church . These included the idea that all people were priests , teaching the gospel in the language most people spoke , and people living poor , simple lives on purpose . The results of the meeting were inconclusive , and Waldo 's ideas , but not the movement itself , were condemned at the Third Lateran Council in the same year , although the leaders of the movement had not been yet excommunicated -LRB- kicked out of the Church -RRB- .
Sent away from Lyon , Waldo and his followers moved to the high valleys of Piedmont , and in France , in the Luberon . Finally , Waldo was excommunicated by Pope Lucius III during the synod held at Verona in 1184 , and the doctrine of the Poor of Lyon was again condemned by the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215 where they are mentioned by name for the first time , and called heresy . The Roman Catholic Church began to persecute the Waldensians , and many were tried and sentenced to death in different European countries during the 12th , 13th , and 14th centuries . The Waldensians survived by moving the Alps and hiding there . Centuries after his death , the Waldensian denomination joined the Genevan or Reformed branch of the Protestant Reformation .

Dundee United Football Club is a professional football club from Dundee , Scotland . They currently play in the Scottish Premier League , and managed by Scottish manager Craig Levein . In the 2007-08 season , they finished 5th in the Scottish Premier League , behind the Old Firm Celtic and Rangers , Motherwell F.C. and Hibernian F.C. despite a relatively impressive season . They had been very close to finishing 3rd , and reached the Scottish Cup Final only to be beaten by Rangers in a very close game .
Dundee United 's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park , located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city . It is situated only 170 y away from Dens Park , home of rivals Dundee F.C. ; the two stadia are the closest senior football grounds anywhere in the United Kingdom .
The club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue . This was a League Cup tie against Rangers in March 1947 , when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable , the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens Park .
The age and proximity of their stadia has led to the possibility of both clubs moving to a new , purpose-built shared stadium being discussed on various occasions . The most recent and serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland 's bid to joint-host the 2008 European Football Championship , with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park . Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal , as rules at the time forbade SPL teams from groundsharing . Following Scotland 's failed bid to host the tournament , the scheme was shelved for the time being , although the plan was raised again in June 2008 following doubts about joint-host Ukraine 's ability to stage Euro 2012 with the Scottish Football Association keen as alternative hosts .

Enrico Fermi -LRB- September 29 1901 â '' November 28 1954 -RRB- was an Italian physicist who worked on the first nuclear reactor and helped make quantum theory . He also was important to particle physics , and statistical mechanics . Fermi won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1938 for his work on induced radioactivity . He built the world 's first nuclear reactor . Fermi was one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century .
Fermi was born in Rome and went to a local grammar school . He was very good at maths and science and won a prize from Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa . He went to the University of Pisa where he studied physics . In 1923 he was given a scholarship from the Italian government and went to GÃ ttingen for more study . He was given a Rockefeller scholarship in 1924 and studied in Leyden . He came back to Italy at the end of 1924 and became Lecturer in Mathematical Physics and Mechanics at the University of Florence .
In 1926 , Fermi discovered the statistical laws , now called Fermi statistics . These laws explain the actions of the particles which are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle , which are now called fermions . These are different to the particles called bosons which are explained by Bose-Einstein statistics . In 1927 he became Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Rome . He spent time studying electrodynamics , and began to closely look at the atomic nucleus . In 1934 , using discoveries made by Wolfgang Pauli , FrÃ dÃ ric Joliot , IrÃ ne Joliot-Curie , he was able to show changes in almost every element bombarded with neutrons . This lead to the discovery of slow neutrons , nuclear fission and making elements that were not in the Periodic Table .

The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the substance boils , or enters a state of rapid evaporation . For water this is 100 Â Celsius or 212 Â Fahrenheit .
One can change the boiling point of liquids by adding an `` inhibitor . '' The change in boiling point can be found about right from : Î '' TB . P. = KbÂ m where Î '' TB . P. = change in boiling point , Kb = a constant -LRB- this is .56 for water -RRB- , and m = molality of the solute .
The boiling point of a liquid also depends on the pressure of the surrounding air . An increase in air pressure increases the boiling point ; a decrease decreases the boiling point . In the low pressure environment at the top of Mt Everest for example , water boils at only 69 Â C. -LRB- 156.2 Â F -RRB- . It can also be defined in terms of vapor pressure as the temperature at which vapor pressure of liquid becomes equal to atmospheric pressure
if you add sugar , salt or any other substance to the water , it will make the boiling point higher but alcohol will have a lower boiling point .
Tracheotomy and tracheostomy is a surgery on the neck to open a direct path by cutting a hole in the trachea -LRB- windpipe -RRB- . They are performed by paramedics , veterinarians , emergency physicians , and surgeons . Both surgical and percutaneous techniques are now widely used .

England is the largest of the countries that today make up the United Kingdom . The name England comes from the Anglo-Saxons who arrived in the 5th century . The territory of England has been united as one country since the 10th century . This article is about the history of that territory until 1707 , when it was joined with the rest of Great Britain .
Archaeology shows that people came to southern England long before the rest of the British Isles , probably because of the friendly climate between and during the ice ages of long ago .
Julius Caesar invaded what is now England in 55 and 54 BC , and wrote in De Bello Gallico that there were many tribes there , who were very similar to other Celtic tribes in Europe . Coins , and later Roman historians , have given us the names of some of the rulers of the tribes , and what they did .
For hundreds of years , what is now England was a Roman province , Britannia . The Romans later gave up on the province and left the Celtic people on their own as the Roman Empire began to fall apart .
After the Romans left around 410 , England was settled by waves of Germanic peoples -LRB- Anglo-Saxons -RRB- .
Jutes , together with large numbers of Frisians , Saxons from northern Germany , and Angles from southern Denmark - often called `` Anglo-Saxons '' , began to invade Britain in the mid-5th century . They were tribes led by royal chiefs , and they settled on the eastern and southern shores .
Analysis of human bodies found at an ancient cemetery near Abingdon , England , shows that Saxon immigrants and native Britons lived side-by-side . The Romano-British population -LRB- the Britons -RRB- was assimilated . The settlement -LRB- or invasion -RRB- of England is called the Saxon Conquest , or the Anglo-Saxon or English Conquest .
From the 4th century AD , many Britons left across the English Channel from Wales , Cornwall and southern Britain , and started to settle the western part of Gaul -LRB- Armorica -RRB- , where they started a new nation : Brittany . The Britons gave their new country its name and the Breton language , Brezhoneg , a sister language to Welsh and Cornish . The name `` Brittany '' -LRB- from `` Little Britain '' -RRB- arose at this time to tell the new Britain apart from `` Great Britain '' . Brezhoneg is still spoken in Brittany today .
Beginning with the raid in 793 on the monastery at Lindisfarne , Vikings made many raids on England .
After a time of raids , the Vikings also began to settle in England and to trade , eventually controlling an area called the Danelaw from the late 9th century . One Viking settlement was at York , called Jorvik by the Vikings . Viking rule left traces in the English language â '' because Old English was already related to Old Norse , many Norse words began to be used in English at this time .
The defeat of King Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 against Duke William II of Normandy , later called William I of England , and the following Norman conquest of England caused important changes in the history of Britain . William ordered the Domesday Book to be written . This was a survey of the entire population , and their lands and property , to help in collecting taxes .
William also ruled Normandy , then a powerful duchy in France . William and his nobles spoke , and held court , in Anglo-Norman , in Normandy as well as in England . The use of the Anglo-Norman language by the aristocracy was kept up for centuries , and had a great influence on the development of English .
In England , the Middle Ages was a time of war , civil war , rebellions from time to time , and many plots among the nobles and royalty . England had more than enough cereals , dairy products , beef and mutton . The nation 's international economy was based on the wool trade , where wool from northern England was sold to the textile merchants of Flanders to make into cloth . Medieval foreign policy was also shaped by relations with the Flemish cloth business . An English cloth business was developed in the fifteenth century , allowing the English also to become wealthier .
In the reign of Henry II , the king got some power back from the barony and the Church . Henry 's successor , Richard I `` the Lion Heart '' , took part in the Third Crusade , and defended his French territories against Philip II of France . His younger brother John , who followed him as king , was not so lucky ; he lost Normandy and many other French territories . In 1215 , the barons led an armed rebellion and forced him to sign the Magna Carta , which put legal limits on the King 's personal powers .
The reign of Edward I -LRB- 1272 â `` 1307 -RRB- was rather successful . Edward strengthened the powers of his Government , and called the first English Parliament . He conquered Wales . His son , Edward II , lost the Battle of Bannockburn against Scotland .
The Black Death , an epidemic that spread over all of Europe and parts of Asia , arrived in England in 1349 and killed perhaps up to a third of the population .
Edward III gave land to powerful noble families , including many people with royal blood . Because land was like power in these days , some powerful men could now try to claim the Crown .
Main article : Early Modern Britain The Wars of the Roses ended with the victory of Henry Tudor , who became king Henry VII of England , at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 , where the Yorkist king , Richard III was killed .
His son , Henry VIII split with the Roman Catholic Church over a question of his divorce from Catherine of Aragon . Though his religious position was not entirely Protestant , this led to the Church of England breaking from the Roman Catholic Church . There followed a time of great religious and political troubles , and the English Reformation .
Henry VIII had three children , all of whom would wear the Crown . The first to reign was Edward VI of England . Although he was intelligent , he was only a boy of ten when he took the throne in 1547 .
When Edward VI died of tuberculosis in 1553 Mary I took the throne when crowds cheered for her in London , which people at the time said was the largest show of affection for a Tudor monarch . Mary , a loyal Catholic who had been influenced greatly by the Catholic King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor , Charles V , tried to get the country back to Catholicism . This led to 274 burnings of Protestants , which are recorded in John Foxe 's Book of Martyrs . She was highly unpopular among her people then . Mary lost Calais , the last English possession on the Continent , and became even more unpopular -LRB- except among Catholics -RRB- at the end of her reign .
The reign of Elizabeth returned a sort of order to England in 1558 . The religious question that had divided the country since Henry VIII was put to rest by the Elizabethan Religious Settlement , which set up the Church of England in much the same form it has today .
The slave trade that made Britain a major economic power began with Elizabeth , who gave John Hawkins permission to start trading in 1562 .
The government of Elizabeth was more peaceful , apart from the revolt of the northern earls in 1569 , and she was able to lessen the power of the old nobility and expand the power of her government . One of the most famous events in English military history was in 1588 when the Spanish Armada lost against the English navy , commanded by Sir Francis Drake . Elizabeth 's government did much to make her government stronger , and to make common law and administration more effective throughout England .
In all , the Tudor period is seen as an important one , leading to many questions that would have to be answered in the next century during the English Civil War . These were questions of how much power the monarch and Parliament should have , and how much one should control the other .
Elizabeth died without children who could take the throne after her . Her closest male Protestant relative was the king of Scotland , James VI , of the house of Stuart , so he became James I of England , the first king of the entire island of Great Britain , although he ruled England and Scotland as separate countries .
The English Civil War began in 1642 , mainly because of conflicts between James ' son , Charles I , and Parliament . The defeat of the Royalist army by the New Model Army of Parliament at the Battle of Naseby in June 1645 destroyed most of the King 's forces . The capture and trial of Charles led to his beheading in January 1649 at Whitehall Gate in London . A republic was declared , and Oliver Cromwell became the Lord Protector in 1653 . After he died , his son Richard Cromwell followed him in the office , but soon quit . The monarchy was returned in 1660 , after England had a time of anarchy , with King Charles II again in London .
In 1665 , London was hit with the plague , and then , in 1666 , the capital was burned for 5 days by the Great Fire , destroying around 15,000 buildings .
In 1689 , the Dutch Protestant William of Orange , replaced the Catholic King James II in what is called the Glorious Revolution . However , in Scotland and Ireland , Catholics loyal to James II were not so happy , and a series of bloody revolts followed . These Jacobite rebellions continued until the mid-18th century , when Charles Edward Stuart was defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746 .
The First Act of Union made Scotland , England and Wales into one county . The history of England after this 1707 Act is a part of Great Britain 's history .

A pinhole camera is a camera without a conventional glass lens . An extremely small hole in a very thin material can focus light when all rays from a scene go through a single point . In order to produce a reasonably clear image , the aperture has to be about a hundred times smaller than the distance to the screen , or less . The shutter of a pinhole camera usually consists of a hand operated flap of some light-proof material to cover and uncover the pinhole .
A common use of a pinhole camera is to capture the movement of sunlight over a long period of time . This type of photography is called Solargraphy . Pinhole cameras require much longer exposure times than conventional cameras because of the small aperture ; typical exposure times can range from 5 seconds to hours or days .
The image may be projected on a translucent screen for real-time viewing -LRB- popular for viewing solar eclipses ; see also camera obscura -RRB- .
Very early in history -LRB- as far back as 500 B.C. -RRB- , Greeks such as Aristotle and Euclid wrote on naturally-occurring rudimentary pinhole cameras , for example light may travel through the slits of wicker baskets and the crossing of leaves The ancient Greeks , however , believed that our eye emitted rays which enabled us to see . What enabled a much better understanding of the pinhole camera was the discovery that light enters the eye rather than leaving it . It was the 10th-century Muslim mathematician , astronomer and physicist Ibn al-Haytham who published this idea .

From the fourteenth century or earlier the annual Midsummer Fair was held on this common land on 24th June and the last such sheep and lamb fair was held in 1913 .
With the development of the London to Brighton mainline railway , however , those in the business soon realized that taking sheep by train was much cheaper and easier than using the old roadways . Most of the animal trading business began to center around rail side markets such as those at Hassocks , Haywards Heath and Lewes train stations . By the start of the 20th century , the animal trading business had all but left the Burgess Hill area .
By the early seventeenth century there was a lot of small brick and tile making companies and during this time pieces of common land were given for house building and small businesses . By the early eighteenth century brick making had been extended and four shops and one or two drinking houses were established on the common .

In 1897 the Victoria Pleasure Gardens were opened by local household name Edwin Street , a well-known farmer and butcher . The gardens were opened in honor of Queen Victoria 's Diamond Jubilee , and contained a large lake , and what can only be described as a small early version of a roller coaster , known as a switchback . The lake was used for boating in the summer , and skating in the winter . The frozen lake was always tested by Mr Street , a man of 23 stone , before being used in the winter . This area is now the Victoria Business Park .
The town gradually grew bigger , having its largest population increase between the years of 1951 and 1961 , when the population of about 7,000 residents almost doubled . This earned Burgess Hill the title of fastest growing town in the south-east . By 1956 , the Victoria Industrial Estate was completed , and has since expanded . It now contains the local headquarters of two large international companies . In 1986 a smaller industrial estate to in the north of the town developed , known as Sheddingdean Industrial Estate . Both Sheddingdean and Victoria have now been renamed as business parks .
Housing estates played their part in building up the population of Burgess Hill throughout the second half of the 20th century ; in the west of the town they provided a wide mix of new residents ; many of them young families and the Folders Lane estate more families settled , along with some richer residents .
The next substantial development was Priory Village in the south west of Burgess Hill , sometimes known as the Tesco estate , due to its proximity to the supermarket . Again , this brought in a mix of incomes , again , many of them young families .
It must be noted that as well as the aforementioned developments , there have been two council estates built in the town - one close to Cants Lane , in the town 's north east , and the area around Denham Road in the west , both of course adding to the ever rising population of the town .
Although now part of the town , World 's End , to the north of the town , was originally a separate community . It still retains its own shops and community association , and is served by Wivelsfield railway station .

Welcome to Friendly .
Friendly is a collection of JavaScripts written by Ioeth that provide an interface similar to Twinkle -LRB- by using AzaToth 's morebits JavaScript library -RRB- for Wikipedia 's more friendly , collaboration-oriented tasks .
Currently , the implemented features are welcome templates , shared IP address tagging , article space templates , talkback , tab shortening and a handy UTC clock that will purge the current page when clicked . This functionality is provided via tabs labeled `` tb '' , `` wel '' and `` shared ip '' when on a user talk page and `` tag '' when in article space . A `` welcome '' link is also placed on diff pages next to users that have empty talk pages .
More features are always in the pipeline and Friendly is under ongoing development , so be sure to report any bugs or request new features on Friendly 's talk page .
Friendly adds additional features to various parts of Wikipedia . Each tab 's ID is given to assist with further customization via additional user CSS or JavaScript .
The friendlyclock feature inserts an updating UTC clock in the top right-hand corner of the screen so that the UTC time is always visible and handy . This feature also allows the ability to easily purge the current page by simply clicking on the clock . If you have other scripts or gadgets installed that add a UTC clock to the screen , you may want to disable them , or disable this feature of Friendly .

Hidehiko Shimizu -LRB- born 4 November 1954 -RRB- is a former Japanese football player . He has played for Nissan Motors .
Orthoptera -LRB- pronounced or-thahp ' - tur-uh -RRB- is an order of insects . The order contains grasshoppers , katydids , and crickets . `` Ortho '' means `` straight '' , so `` Orthoptera '' means `` straight wings '' . This means the front wings , called tegmina , that are stiff , straight , and not used for flying . The back wings are membrane and are folded like a fan under the front wings when the creature is not flying . Many in this order use their wings to make sounds , which we usually call `` chirping '' noises .
Creatures in order Orthoptera begin their life in an egg case . After three weeks â `` or when spring comes â `` the tiny nymph come out from the egg case . After four or five molt , they have wings that let them fly . This shows that they are adults -LRB- grown up -RRB- and are ready to reproduce -LRB- make babies -RRB- .
In the order Orthoptera , members chew their food , moving their mandibles -LRB- jaws -RRB- sideways - not up and down like humans do . Crickets are omnivores , which means they eat both plants and animals . Actually , they will eat almost anything : vegetables , cereal , and even their own mate if they are hungry enough . Katydids are mostly herbivores -LRB- plant eaters -RRB- , though they will eat their own mate , too , if they are hungry enough . They also enjoy eating aphids and other small , slow-moving creatures . Grasshoppers almost always eat plants like grass , wheat bran , and lettuce , but this does not make them much better than the others : they can be terrible crop pests .
It 's quite hard to catch a member of Orthoptera because they jump so well . They have amazing legs - a grasshopper can jump 20 times farther than the length of its body . Their back legs are very large and long . These long , strong legs give these insects their great ability to jump .
Crickets , katydids , and grasshoppers belong to the same order of Orthoptera because they are alike in lots of ways . However , there are several things that make them different from each other .
First , their colors are usually quite different . Since grasshoppers like to move during the daytime , their colors are similar to grass and bright flowers , making them usually green , light brown , or multicolored -LRB- lots of different colors at once -RRB- . Crickets move at night , so they are dark . Katydids like to spend a lot of time on leaves , so they are often leaf-colored , and their wings can look like leaves . Their wings can have the same vein patterns as leaves , and they often have little brown spots just like the ones that might be found on a leaf .
Secondly , their behaviors are different . Grasshoppers like being active in the day ; crickets , at night ; katydids , in the late afternoon and evening .
Thirdly , their antennae is different . Katydids and crickets usually have long , thin antennae , while grasshoppers usually have short , thick ones . Of course , this rule does is not perfect -- for instance , even though grasshoppers usually have short , thick antennae , the long-horned grasshopper has long , thin antennae like a cricket . Because of this , it is still sometimes hard to tell the members of this order apart .
A sniper is a person who is trained to shoot perfectly at things which are very small or very far away . The sniper 's target is most often a human or non-human enemy . A military sniper has often been given special training to use a sniper rifle , a special type of gun . Most of the time , a sniper rifle has a telescope called a sniper scope to help the sniper see the target . Snipers are also trained to be stealthy . Snipers hide or use camouflage such as a ghillie suit consist of the surrounding foilage so that it is hard for the enemy to see them . A sniper is also called a `` marksman '' .
Experienced hunters often share many of the skills that snipers need to know . The two jobs are very similar . The word `` sniper '' came from Britain when highly accurate shooters would hunt `` snipe '' -- birds that were very hard to see and shoot .
Many police departments have snipers on their SWAT teams . Because police snipers do not always perform the same tasks as military snipers , police snipers are sometimes known as `` marksmen '' .
Snipers shoot targets that are far away . Because the bullet shot by a sniper has to travel a very long distance , the sniper has to be very careful when taking aim . There are three main things that have an effect on the accuracy of the shot . The sniper must plan for these things .
The bullets used by snipers are usually heavy . They are powered by a large amount of gunpowder . This makes the bullet travel very fast . The heaviness makes the bullet less affected by wind . The speed makes the bullet less affected by gravity . A fast bullet reaches a target quicker , before it has time for gravity to affect it . Large fast bullets do more damage to the target than lighter or slower bullets .
Most soldiers are trained so that they can shoot a target that is between 200 m to 300 m away and hit it with approximately half their shots . Very well trained soldiers , such as the U.S. Marine Corps , can hit a target that is between 400 m to 500 m away , with approximately half of their shots . A sniper is trained to be able to hit a target over 800 m , or half a mile away with almost every single shot . Some snipers are so accurate that they can shoot something out of a person 's hand , but they usually aim for the target 's head or chest . These areas are harder to miss , and are more likely to disable the target .
A sniper uses a special kind of rifle called a sniper rifle . This rifle is much more accurate than normal rifles . Almost all sniper rifles use a Sniper scope , a special telescope that allows them to see targets very far away . There are two different kinds of sniper rifles : bolt action rifles , which fire a single shot and then the user must ready the next shot , and semi-automatic -LRB- `` semi-auto '' -RRB- rifles which fire a single shot each time the trigger is pulled , and automatically ready the next shot for firing . Typically , bolt-action rifles have a longer range and are more accurate than semi-automatic rifles , however because each round must be loaded by operating the bolt , the rate of fire is slower than a semi-automatic rifle , which fires as fast as the shooter can squeeze the trigger . At close ranges , or where a shooter must make a quick follow-up shot , a sniper may prefer to use the semi-automatic rifle instead . A magazine is used on semi automatic rifles and most bolt action rifles . Magazines hold more shots in the gun and make it much faster to ready the next shot . With many rifles , the shooter can carry more full magazines to put into the gun when the magazine that is in the gun is empty .
Snipers usually wear camouflage clothing , to avoid being seen . Camouflage works by hiding the outline and shape of the human body , so that it is not easily seen . Camouflage does not work very well when the person wearing it is moving because the eye sees movement much better than shapes or colors . Snipers often paint their faces green or black to make them shine less , and blend in with the surroundings . Sometimes snipers wear special camouflage suits , called ghillie suits . Ghillie suits are made of shredded burlap or yute and often have plants attached to them . Snipers will often make several different ghillie suits to help them hide in different kinds of terrain . These suits are very effective at hiding the sniper . Often a sniper can be invisible to an enemy standing right next to him .
Police snipers generally do not need camouflage , because their main job is to make accurate shots , not to hide from the criminal . Sometimes police need to hide , so police snipers are trained in hiding techniques .
Military snipers are chosen for their intelligence , their good sight and their ability to shoot very well . They are trained to use their sight very well . They are trained to see the enemy from far away , and to notice small movements that might show that enemies are near . They are also trained to hide themselves . Snipers use these skills to destroy enemy troops . Snipers generally work in a small unit -LRB- or team -RRB- of just two people , a sniper and a spotter . The spotter finds targets for the sniper with a telescope . If the sniper misses the target , then the spotter also helps the sniper adjust the next shot so it hits the target . The spotter also protects the sniper from enemies at close range .
Snipers are often used as scouts for the army because they can easily hide themselves from the enemy , even when they are close . They use the sniper scope on their rifles to see farther than most soldiers are able to see . Snipers are often able to notice details and remember information that ordinary soldiers would not . When a sniper is in a team with a spotter , it is usually the spotter 's job to use a radio to speak with other military units . The team can report on the enemy position and enemy movements .
In World War I -LRB- WWI -RRB- , there were no special sniper rifles . Instead , snipers used normal rifles with a sniper scope mounted on them .
In World War II , snipers were common . They were an important part of the fighting . Every squad of the Soviet army included sniper or a ` marksman ' . Camouflage tactics were developed during this time . Snipers were very useful during the Battle of Stalingrad . One Russian sniper was said to have killed over 240 German troops . Also , it was n't a limit , for example , Mihail Surkov killed 702 enemy troops and Semen Nomokonov killed sniper-only 367 persons , including a general .
Police departments train and use snipers . These snipers mainly serve on the SWAT team for their department . Often they are called upon to provide security at special events , or to make sure that other snipers do not murder someone . This job is called counter-sniping . Most police snipers are trained by the military .
Some snipers are famous for having killed hundreds of enemy soldiers . One such sniper is U.S. Marine Corps sniper Carlos Hathcock , who was famous in the Vietnam War for wearing a white feather in his hat . Other snipers are famous for being able to kill an enemy from very far away . Carlos Hathcock held the record for the furthest distance kill for a very long time â '' his farthest was over 2500 y. However , in the Afghanistan War , snipers from the Canadian Army broke the record with a shot of 2430 m. Other snipers are known for difficult shots . For example , Matt Hughes had to make a 860 m shot in very high winds by aiming over 56 f to the left of the enemy . An example of a famous sniper in WWII is Vasily Zaytsev . He supposedly killed 225 enemy soldiers during the Battle of Stalingrad .
Snipers are often used in video games as elite soldiers . Getting a headshot with a sniper rifle is thought of as a hard skill to learn . In some movies , assassins use sniper rifles ; examples include Phone Booth and Vantage Point . . Sometimes snipers have a bad reputation in the media ; for example , in October 2002 two men went on a month long killing spree using a Sniper rifle in the Virginia and Maryland area .

The Kalmar Union was a historical union of Sweden , Norway , Denmark , Western Finland , and various other provinces and areas . At that time , Norway included Iceland , Greenland , the Faroe Islands , Shetland , Orkney , and parts of Finland belonged to Sweden . The union was started in 1397 at a meeting in the town of Kalmar , Sweden . The union ended in 1523 , because Sweden became independent .
For the electric plug-in hybrid concept car , see Chevrolet Volt . For the record label , see Volt Records The volt -LRB- symbol : V -RRB- is the SI derived unit of electric potential difference or electromotive force . It is named in honor of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta -LRB- 1745 â `` 1827 -RRB- , who invented the voltaic pile , the first chemical battery .
The volt is defined as the potential difference across a conductor when a current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power . Hence , it is the base SI representation m2 Â kg Â s-3 Â A-1 , which can be equally represented as one joule of energy per coulomb of charge , J\/C .
In the hydraulic analogy sometimes used to explain electric circuits by comparing them to water-filled pipes , voltage is likened to water pressure - it determines how fast the electrons will travel through the circuit . Current -LRB- in amperes -RRB- , in the same analogy , is a measure of the volume of water that flows past a given point , the rate of which is determined by the voltage , and the total output measured in watts . The equation that brings all three components together is : volts Ã -- amperes = watts
Note : Where ` RMS ' -LRB- root mean square -RRB- is stated above , the peak voltage is times greater than the RMS voltage for a sinusoidal signal .
In 1800 , as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Luigi Galvani , Alessandro Volta developed the so-called Voltaic pile , a forerunner of the battery , which produced a steady electric current . Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was zinc and silver . In the 1880s , the International Electrical Congress , now the International Electrotechnical Commission -LRB- IEC -RRB- , approved the volt for electromotive force . The volt was defined as the potential difference across a conductor when a current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power .
Bromate is an ion . Its chemical formula is BrO3 - . It contains bromine in its +5 oxidation state . It is more common than hypobromites , perbromates , and bromites . Sodium bromate is an example . Bromates are strong oxidizing agents .
Bromates are made by reacting bromides with ozone . They can also be made by electrolysis of a hot bromide solution . Chlorine dioxide can react with bromide when in sunlight to make bromate . Bromates can be made by reacting potassium hydroxide with bromine . This makes bromide and bromate . Bromates can be made by reacting bromic acid with a base .
It might be a carcinogen . It is made when bromide is in water and reacted with ozone or chlorine . Sometimes water with too much bromate has to be gotten rid of .

Eels is a rock music project consisting of Mark Oliver Everett and many other people .
Mark Oliver Everett , his alternate persona Mr. E , and Eels are all the same person . Mark Oliver Everett is his birth name . Mr. E is his nickname , which he began calling himself as a teenager because it sounded `` mysterious . '' Also , many of his friends made fun of him because his initials spelled out `` MOE , '' which he hated .
Unlike most traditional rock bands , Eels rarely plays with the same combinations of members twice . Mark Everett is the only constant member , meaning that he is the only one who plays on every single album and live show . All other members are friends of his who contribute other instruments to the albums and concerts , and most of them are in other bands , such as Aysa and Chloe from the pop band Smoosh . Many do not use their real names , as Everett does ; for instance , bassist Koool G Murder performed on the albums Souljacker and Hombre Lobo , and has played bass at most shows on the tours for both albums .
Each Eels concert is different . Most feature the members who perform the song on the album playing the instruments that they did on that song , although many are acoustic sets , meaning that Mark Everett simply sings and plays piano all by himself . A lot of songs that Eels perform live are covers -LRB- songs written by other people -RRB- , and songs that have never appeared on any albums .
Mark Everett 's father was Hugh Everett III , a scientist who was the first person to propose the idea that our universe is just one of several connected `` alternate '' universes . At the time -LRB- 1954 -RRB- , no one believed Everett , and he considered himself a failure . He died when Mark was 19 .
Mark 's first album was called Bad Dude in Love -LRB- 1985 -RRB- . It was self-released , meaning that Everett recorded and designed the packaging for the entire album all on his own , selling only five hundred copies to a few friends . That album was the first and last to be released under his full name , Mark Oliver Everett . His next album , A Man Called E -LRB- 1992 -RRB- was released only as E , and sold many more copies than Bad Dude in Love . Because many critics did not know who E was , they were confused by the album 's title , but the album still sold well .
Everett 's next album as E was Broken Toy Shop -LRB- 1993 -RRB- . The cover art , which depicts Everett sitting in the center of a toy city , has been said to be his least favorite album cover out of all his releases . This would be Everett 's last album using his real name or his pseudonym E , as Eels ' first album , Beautiful Freak , featuring bassist Tommy Walter and drummer Butch , was released in 1996 .
In 1998 , Everett became the only living member of his family after his sister killed herself and his mother died of lung cancer . He wrote 16 songs about his sadness that later became his next Eels album , Electro-Shock Blues , featuring Butch from the last album . Butch and Everett would also be the only members to appear on 2000 's Daisies of the Galaxy .
In 2001 , Everett participated in a philosophical vacation on which he was not alllowed to write or speak for religious reasons . Finding himself inspired , he broke the rules and wrote 12 songs that would later become Souljacker , with Koool G Murder , Butch , Joe Gore , John Parish , and Adam Siegel . During this time , he had stopped shaving , and his beard had begun to grow very long , as shown in this picture . Today , Everettâ s beard is even longer , and the most recent Eels album -LRB- Hombre Lobo â `` Spanish for werewolf , featuring Koool G Murder and Knuckles -RRB- features songs that Everett wrote about how the beard made him look and feel more â dangerous . â
Following Souljacker , Eels released Shootenanny ! , an album that drew a lot of negative attention to the band -LRB- at the time consisting of E , Butch , Joe Gore , and Koool G Murder -RRB- for Everettâ s inappropriate behavior at press events to support the album . In an interview with an Australian television show about rock music , Everett joked about the interviewer waking him up after having sex with a prostitute and doing heroin the night before . Also , Everett was asked to write a review of the diaries of Kurt Cobain -LRB- who had died eight years before -RRB- ; his review was a single sentence : â Please donâ t do this to me after I die . â Eelsâ subsequent release , Blinking Lights and Other Revelations , a double-disc concept album about a journey through life but not in a chronological order , was much more well-received .
In addition to these studio albums , Eels has also released one Best Of collection , six live albums , two collections of unreleased material , a book by Everett about his father -LRB- and a subsequent documentary film that aired on BBC -RRB- , and has written songs for eleven movies , including all three Shrek films .

Sokka is a fictional character and one of the main characters in Nickelodeon 's animated television series Avatar : The Last Airbender . The character was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko , and voiced by Jack DeSena . In the film version , The Last Airbender , in which is his name is pronounced differently , the character is played by Jackson Rathbone .
In the show , 15-year-old Sokka is a warrior of the South Pole 's Southern Water Tribe , a race of people who can control water . He , along with his younger sister Katara , discovers an Airbender named Aang , the long-lost Avatar , and accompanies him on his mission to win the Fire Nation and bring peace to the world .
Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko said that Sokka was originally designed to be much more low-key , but when his comedian voice actor Jack DeSena came in and brought liveliness to his character , they began writing towards that strength . Much of Sokka 's dialogue and actions are derived from improvisations and intentional exaggerations on DeSena 's part that the writers chose to include within scripts .
As a result of his design , Sokka 's character has come to serve as a source of comic relief during the series , often a victim of visual slapstick . He also is extremely sarcastic .
Sokka grew up in his village and trains the warriors of his village . Forced to mature quickly when his mother Kya was killed in a Fire Nation raid , he cultivated his warrior skills with a militant zeal , while his sister Katara did chores and practiced waterbending . When Sokka was thirteen , his father and the other village men left to help the Earth Kingdom to fight against the Fire Nation , leaving him and his sister to look after their tribe with their grandmother , Gran Gran . As the oldest male left in the South Pole , Sokka came to assume a semi-leadership role by the time he was sixteen , fiercely protecting the village from any possible outside threats while trying to train children to be a new generation of defenders .
While on a expedition , Katara and Sokka discovered Aang inside an iceberg with Appa . After Katara freed him , Sokka initially believed that the Aang might be a Fire Navy spy , and he eventually grew xenophobic enough to banish him from the village . Upon discovering that Aang was the Avatar , destined to master all four elements and bring peace to the world , Sokka relented , realizing that they had a common enemy in the Fire Nation . He then set off with Katara and Aang on their journey to find a waterbending master at the North Pole , determined to hone his warrior skills by way of fighting Firebenders along the way . Fire Nation general Zhao killed Tui -LRB- the moon spirit -RRB- causing the moon to turn red and then vanish as during a lunar eclipse , thus preventing the waterbenders from using waterbending . Princess Yue -LRB- one of Sokka 's love interests , the other being Kyoshi warrior Suki -RRB- then becomes the new moon by giving her life energy to the moon spirit , thereby restoring the moon in the sky and the abilities of the waterbenders .
In `` Sokka 's Master '' -LRB- the 4th episode of third season -RRB- Sokka expresses self-doubt and worry that he is not usefull as much to the group as his bender companions are . Inspired by his friends ' encouragement , he seeks out a master from whom he could learn the art of the sword . Rather than fighting with brute force and flawless technique , Sokka 's creativity and heterodox approach to things are the cornerstones of his technique , and his master notes that in time Sokka will be a superior swordsman . As he departs , his master gives him a game piece that was previously established as a sign of connection to the secret society known as the Order of the White Lotus .
In the two-hour series finale , Sokka and Katara meet with Katara 's Waterbending master , Pakku , who has now married their grandmother . In the battle against Ozai , Sokka , his girlfriend Suki , and Toph destroyed a Fire Nation airship and use it to destroy others of its kind while Aang duels with the Phoenix King -LRB- Ozai -RRB- . Sokka and Toph are separated from Suki and attack another airship , but Sokka breaks his leg and strains his arm grabbing hold of Toph , who was falling off the ship . In a compromised position , the pair are attacked by two soldiers , whom Sokka defeats at the cost of his sword and boomerang . As he and Toph are on the edge of the crashing ship , Suki arrives with another airship and saves the two . With the battle over , the trio reunite with Aang and the vanquished Phoenix King . At Zuko 's coronation , Suki is reunited with her fellow Kyoshi Warriors , Sokka and Katara are reunited with their father , with the rest of the group reunited with their friends . In the end , Sokka is seen at Iroh 's tea shop in Ba Sing Se where everyone teases a painted picture he created of the entire team , wherein he altered some factual details to make the scene more `` memorable '' .
In the live-action movie The Last Airbender by M. Night Shyamalan , Sokka is played by Jackson Rathbone . His name is pronounced `` So-kah , '' but in the show it 's name pronounced `` Sah-kah '' . Several important changes to the character 's personality were made . In the film he is no longer the comic relief , nor does he exhibit any inventive abilities or usefulness in battle . He rarely shares screen time with Aang , the main hero , or contibe in any way to the plot . M.

Speech recognition is the process of converting spoken words into computer text . The user speaks into a microphone and the computer creates a text file of the words they have spoken .
Although the accuracy of these systems has improved in recent years they are still far from perfect . If you only need them to recognize a few words , for example the words one , two , three etc. , then speech recognition software can be very accurate . This is why this feature has started to appear on modern mobile phones . But systems that can recognize any word spoken by any person in any language are still a few years away .
You can greatly improve the accuracy of these systems by training them to recognize just one voice . This is usually done by getting the user to read a short set piece of text into the microphone . The user looks at the text which has been created and corrects any mistakes the software has made . By repeating this a number of times the computer 's accuracy increases a great deal .

Mendelian inheritance is a set of rules about genetic inheritance .
The basic rules of genetics were first discovered by a monk named Gregor Mendel in the 1850s , and published in 1866 . For thousands of years , people had noticed how traits are inherited from parents to their children . However , Mendel 's work was different because he did experiments on plants , and designed those experiments very carefully .
In his experiments , Mendel studied how traits were passed on in pea plants . He started his crosses with plants that bred true , and counted characters that were either\/or in nature -LRB- either tall or short -RRB- . He bred large numbers of plants , and expressed his results numerically . He used test crosses to reveal the presence and proportion of recessive characters .
Mendel 's laws apply widely , but not to all living things . They apply to any organism which is diploid -LRB- has two paired sets of chromosomes -RRB- and which engages in sexual reproduction . They would not apply to bacteria , for example , or to asexual reproduction . They do apply to the great majority of plants and animals .
Mendel 's laws explained the results he got with his pea plants . Later , geneticists discovered that his laws were also true for other living things , even humans . Mendel 's findings from his work on the garden pea plants helped to establish the field of genetics . His contributions were not limited to the basic rules that he discovered . Mendel 's care towards controlling experiment conditions along with his attention to his numerical results set a standard for future experiments . Over the years , scientists have changed and improved Mendel 's ideas . However , the science of genetics would not be possible today without the early work of Gregor Mendel .

William Charles `` Bill '' Ayers -LRB- b. 26 December 1944 -RRB- is an American elementary education theorist . He is a former head of the Weather Underground . Ayers is known for speaking out against the Vietnam War in the 1960s . He is also known for his current work in trying to help make learning and teaching better . In 1969 , Ayers started the Weather Underground . The Weather Underground is a group that call themselves a `` communist revolutionary group '' . They carried out bombings against public buildings during the 1960s and 1970s . This was because the United States was being a part of the Vietnam War . Ayers is a professor in the College of Education at the University of Illinois at Chicago . He has the titles of Distinguished Professor of Education and Senior University Scholar . During the 2008 U.S. Presidential election , a controversy was brought up over ties between Ayers and then Senator Barack Obama . He is married to Bernadine Dohrn . She was also a member of the Weather Underground .
Bill Ayers grew up in Glen Ellyn , Illinois . Glen Ellyn is just outside Chicago . He went to public schools there until his second year of high school . After this he started going to Lake Forest Academy . It is a smaller prep school . Ayers received a B.A. from the University of Michigan in American studies in 1968 . He is the son of Thomas G. Ayers . His father used to be Chairman and CEO of Commonwealth Edison .
In 1965 , Ayers was part of a picket line . They were protesting at a restaurant in Ann Arbor , Michigan . The restaurant would not serve African Americans . Ayers ' first arrest came when he took part in a sit-in at a local draft board . He sat in jail for ten days . Shortly after his arrest , he landed his first teaching job at the Children 's Community School . This small preschool was run from a local church basement . The preschool was part of a larger movement across the United States called the `` free school movement '' . Schools that were part of this movement had no grades or report cards . Instead , they tried to work on getting students to cooperate with each other and work together instead of competing . The teachers allowed the students to call them by their first names . After teaching for only a few months , at the age of 21 , Ayers became the head of the school . There he also met Diana Oughton , who would be his girlfriend until her death in an explosion in 1970 .
Ayers became part of the New Left and the Students for a Democratic Society -LRB- SDS -RRB- in the early 1960s . In 1968 and 1969 , Ayers became well-known as a head of the SDS . He was head of a smaller SDS group called the `` Jesse James Gang '' . Ayers made important changes to Weatherman beliefs about being militia . The group that Ayers headed in Detroit , Michigan became one of the first groups that would turn into the Weathermen . Before the June 1969 SDS convention , Ayers became an important head of the group . This came about due to a split in the group .
In June 1969 , the Weathermen took over the SDS at its convention . Ayers was made Education Secretary . -LRB- Later in 1969 , Ayers helped to place a bomb at a statue that was made to honor policemen that were killed . The bomb blast broke almost 100 windows and blew parts of the statue onto a nearby street . -LRB- The statue was rebuilt and unveiled on May 4 , 1970 , and blown up again by other Weathermen on October 6 , 1970 . While they were putting it back together , the city put a 24-hour guard around it to stop another attack . In January 1972 , it was moved to Chicago Police headquarters . Ayers was also part of the Days of Rage riot that took place in Chicago in 1969 . He was also a part of the `` War Council '' meeting that happened in Flint , Michigan . Two big decisions came from the `` War Council '' . The first was to start a violent , armed resistance -LRB- using bombs , and robberies -RRB- against the government . The second was to start underground -LRB- secret -RRB- groups in important cities around the country . An FBI informant named Larry Grathwohl , who pretended to be a Weatherman in 1969 , said that `` Ayers , along with Bernardine Dohrn , probably had the most authority within the Weatherman '' .
In 1970 , Weatherman members Ted Gold , Terry Robbins , and Diana Oughton were killed when a bomb they were building blew up . This was called the Greenwich Village town house explosion . Ayers and several other Weathermen were able to avoid being caught following this explosion . Ayers was not facing charges at this time , but the federal government later brought charges against him . Ayers was part of the bombings of New York City Police Department headquarters in 1970 , the United States Capitol building in 1971 , and the Pentagon in 1972 . Ayers wrote , in 2001 , that : Although the bomb that rocked the Pentagon was itsy-bitsy - weighing close to two pounds - it caused ` tens of thousands of dollars ' of damage . The operation cost under $ 500 , and no one was killed or even hurt .
Some new reports have said that Ayers , Dohrn , or the Weatherman took part in the 1970 San Francisco Police Department bombing . However , neither Ayers , nor anyone else has ever been charged with this crime .
In 1973 , it was discovered that the FBI were focusing on the Weatherman as well as the New Left . This was part of several secret , and sometimes illegal FBI projects called COINTEL . Because the FBI agents had broken the law , the government asked that all weapons and bomb charges be dropped against the Weather Underground . This included charges against Ayers .
However , there were still state charges against Dohrn . Dohrn did not want to turn herself in to the police . `` He was sweet and patient , as he always is , to let me come to my senses on my own '' , she later said of Ayers . She finally turned herself in in 1980 . She was fined $ 1,500 and given three years probation .
In 1973 Ayers helped write the book Prairie Fire with others who were part of the Weather Underground . They dedicated the book to almost 200 people , including Harriet Tubman , John Brown , ` All Who Continue to Fight ' , ` All Political Prisoners in the U.S. ' , and Sirhan Sirhan , who was convicted of killing Robert F. Kennedy .
In 2001 , Ayers wrote Fugitive Days : A Memoir . He said Fugitive Days tried to answer the questions of Kathy Boudin 's son and his statement that Diana Oughton died trying to stop the Greenwich Village bomb makers . Some have questioned the truth , accuracy , and tone of the book . Brent Staples wrote for The New York Times Book Review that `` Ayers reminds us often that he ca n't tell everything without endangering people involved in the story . Historian Jesse Lemisch -LRB- who was also a member of the SDS -RRB- said that Ayers ' memories were wrong . Ayers , in the beginning of his book , says that it was written as his personal memories and was not a research project .
Chicago Magazine said that `` just before the September 11 attacks '' , Richard Elrond , who was hurt in the `` Days of Rage '' , was given an apology from Ayers and Dohrn . '' -LRB- T -RRB- hey were remorseful , '' Elrod says . `` They said , ` We 're sorry that things turned out this way . ' '' Ayers gave a lot of interviews before his book was published . In these interviews he defended his history of radical words and actions . Some of the articles were written before the September 11 attacks and appeared right after . Many comments were made by the media comparing the statements that Ayers was making about his past just as a terrorist incident shocked the public .
A lot of the controversy about Ayers in the years since 2000 comes from an interview that he gave to The New York Times . The reporter quoted him as saying `` I do n't regret setting bombs '' and `` I feel we did n't do enough '' . When asked if he would `` do it all again , '' he said `` I do n't want to discount the possibility . '' Ayers questioned the interviewer 's way of describing him in a `` Letter to the Editor '' on September 15 2001 . In his letter , Ayers wrote : `` This is not a question of being misunderstood or ` taken out of context ' , but of deliberate distortion . '' In the following years , Ayers has said that what he meant by saying that he had `` no regrets '' and `` we did n't do enough '' he was talking about their efforts to stop the US from fighting in the Vietnam War . He said these efforts were '' ... inadequate -LRB- as -RRB- the war dragged on for a decade . '' Ayers has repeatedly said that the two statements did not mean that he wished they had set more bombs .
Ayers was asked in a 2004 interview , `` How do you feel about what you did ? Would you do it again under similar circumstances ? '' He said : `` I 've thought about this a lot . Being almost 60 , it 's impossible to not have lots and lots of regrets about lots and lots of things , but the question of did we do something that was horrendous , awful ? ... I do n't think so . I think what we did was to respond to a situation that was unconscionable . '' On September 9 , 2008 , journalist Jake Tapper talked about the comic strip in Ayers ' blog , where he explained the soundbite : `` The one thing I do n't regret is opposing the war in Vietnam with every ounce of my being ... When I say , ` We did n't do enough , ' a lot of people rush to think , ` That must mean , `` We did n't bomb enough shit . '' ' But that 's not the point at all . It 's not a tactical statement , it 's an obvious political and ethical statement . In this context , ` we ' means ` everyone . ' ''
The Weather Underground crossed lines of legality , of propriety and perhaps even of common sense . Our effectiveness can be â '' and still is being â '' debated .
The Weather Underground went on to take responsibility for placing several small bombs in empty offices ... We did carry out symbolic acts of extreme vandalism directed at monuments to war and racism , and the attacks on property , never on people , were meant to respect human life and convey outrage and determination to end the Vietnam war .
In an interview that Ayers gave in 1995 , he said of his political beliefs in the 1960s and 1970s : `` I am a radical , Leftist , small ` c ' communist ... -LRB- Laughs -RRB- Maybe I 'm the last communist who is willing to admit it . -LRB- Laughs -RRB- We have always been small ` c ' communists in the sense that we were never in the Communist party and never Stalinists . The ethics of communism still appeal to me . I do n't like Lenin as much as the early Marx . I also like Henry David Thoreau , Mother Jones and Jane Addams -LRB- ... -RRB- '' In 1970 Ayers was called `` a national leader '' of the Weatherman organization and `` one of the chief theoreticians of the Weathermen '' by The New York Times .
The Weatherman started off as part of the Revolutionary Youth Movement -LRB- RYM -RRB- within the SDS . They split from the RYM 's Maoists saying they had no time to build another party . They also said that war against the United States government and capitalism should begin right away . Their founding paper called for the creation of a `` white fighting force '' to fight with the `` Black Liberation Movement '' and other `` anti-colonial ' movements . to achieve `` the destruction of US imperialism and the achievement of a classless world : world communism . '' In June 1974 , the Underground released their 151 page work called `` Prairie Fire '' . `` Prairie Fire '' said that : `` We are a guerrilla organization -LRB- ... -RRB- We are communist women and men underground in the United States -LRB- ... -RRB- '' The Weatherman 's leaders , including Ayers , wanted radical changes to sexual relations and used the slogan `` Smash Monogamy '' .
Larry Grathwohl , who was an FBI agent who joined the Underground , said that Ayers wanted to overthrow the United States government . In an interview that he gave in January 2009 , Grathwohl said that :
`` The thing the most bone chilling thing Bill Ayers said to me was that after the revolution succeeded and the government was overthrown , they believed they would have to eliminate 25 million Americans who would not conform to the new order . ''
`` Never said it . Never thought it . And again , Larry Grathwohl , I do n't know him today , but certainly the FBI was an organization built on lies . ''
In an interview with ABC7 reporter Alan Wang , Ayers said that `` Now that 's being blown into dishonest narratives about hurting people , killing people , planning to kill people . That 's just not true . We destroyed government property , '' said Ayers . However , when asked if he ever made bombs , Ayers replied : `` I 'm just not going to talk about it . ''
During the 2008 U.S. presidential election , a controversy started about Ayers ' contact with then-Senator Barack Obama . This had been well known in Chicago for years . After being raised by the British press The ties between Ayers and Obama was written about by blogs and newspapers in the United States . The issue was also talked about in a debate by moderator George Stephanopoulos . It later became an issue for John McCain 's campaign . `` The New York Times '' , CNN , and several other news groups said that Obama does not have a close friendship with Ayers . After the election , Ayers said he did not have any close ties with Obama and condemned the Republicans for using `` guilt by association '' tactics . In a new afterword to his book , he added a note saying that he knew the Obamas `` as neighbors and family friends . '' But in an interview with Good Morning America , Ayers said the afterword was `` describing there how the blogosphere characterized the relationship . ''

Mesopotamia is made up of different regions . Northern Mesopotamia is made up of hills and plains . Seasonal rains , and the rivers and streams come from the mountains . Early settlers farmed the land and used timber , metals and stone . Southern Mesopotamia is made up of marshy areas and wide , flat , plains . Cities developed along the rivers which flow through the region . Early settlers had to irrigate the land along the banks of the rivers in order for their crops to grow .
Mesopotamia has been conquered many times , by many different peoples . It was the heartland of the Sumerian , Akkadian , Babylonian and Assyrian empires . As each new group moved into the region they adopted some of the culture , traditions and beliefs of the people who had come before . It was conquered by Alexander the Great -LRB- 332 BC -RRB- , the Parthians -LRB- 150 BC -RRB- , the Romans , the Persian Empire , the Arabs -LRB- 7th century -RRB- . It is still one of the most fertile -LRB- and therefore valuable -RRB- parts of the Middle East .
Ancient Mesopotamia begins in the late 6th millennium BC , and ends with either the rise of the Achaemenid Persians in the 6th century BC or the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia in the 7th century CE . This long period may be divided as follows :
The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient story about a relationship between Gilgamesh and his close companion , Enkidu . Enkidu is a wild man created by the gods as Gilgamesh 's equal to distract him from oppressing the citizens of Uruk . Together they undertake dangerous quests that incur the displeasure of the gods . Firstly , they journey to the Cedar Mountain to defeat Humbaba , its monstrous guardian . Later they kill the Bull of Heaven that the goddess Ishtar has sent to punish Gilgamesh for turning down her advances .
The second part of the epic is about Gilgamesh 's distressed reaction to Enkidu 's death , which takes the form of a quest for immortality . Gilgamesh attempts to learn the secret of eternal life by undertaking a long and perilous journey to meet the immortal flood hero , Utnapishtim . The words addressed to Gilgamesh in the midst of his quest foreshadow the end result : `` The life that you are seeking you will never find . When the gods created man they allotted to him death , but life they retained in their own keeping '' .

Once Upon a Time in America is a 1984 movie directed by Sergio Leone and starring Robert De Niro and James Woods as Jewish gangsters . The movie was Sergio Leone 's last before his death .
When Leone finished making the movie it was 229 minutes -LRB- 3 hours and 49 minutes -RRB- and started with an old character -LRB- Robert De Niro -RRB- remembering his past ; it then showed him as a child and as a young adult . We call this flashbacks ; it can happen in movie but certainly not in real life . But when it was first shown to American audiences it was made much shorter and set in chronological order ; meaning the movie first showed the characters as children , then as young adults and then as older adults ; or ` from start to finish ' . We call this chronological ; this is what would happen in real life . Many people agree that the longer version is much better than the shortened chronological version .

Negative feedback is a basic concept of cybernetics ; it is the basis of regulation and control . It is important in engineering and physiology . In biology and physiology negative feedback is known as homeostasis .
Negative feedback occurs when the output of a system acts to oppose changes to the input of a system . This has the result that the changes are made less , and the system kept within limits . The classic example is a central heating system which cuts off when a -LRB- suitably placed -RRB- temperature sensor hits a pre-set mark . The negative feedback part is the thermostat .
Virtually all aspect of living systems involve homeostasis , and disease follows when any of these systems fail . Examples : blood pressure , glucose level , liver functions , cell division , and so on .
Homeostasis was defined by Claude Bernard and later by Walter Bradford Cannon in 1926 , 1929 and 1932 is the property of a system , either open or closed , that regulates its internal environment and tends to maintain a stable , constant condition . The concept came from that of milieu interieur which was created by Claude Bernard and published in 1865 .
If the overall feedback of the system is negative , then the system will tend to be stable .

Lissa Explains it All is a website . It teaches beginners and kids HTML as well as other things like JavaScript to help them make a website . It was made by Alyssa `` Lissa '' Daniels '' -LRB- born 1986 -RRB- in 1998 .
Lissa did not plan on teaching HTML at first . She was an 11 year old girl who wanted to make a website but had problems remembering the HTML codes . She saved the codes on a webpage . Many people who saw her website asked her how she made it . Lissa gave them the address -LRB- URL -RRB- to the webpage she put the codes on . As more and more people went on the page , Lissa added more codes and information , and made the URL it became public .
A year later , so many people went on Lissa Explains that Lissa decided she needed a domain name for her website . She bought the domain name , lissaexplains.com . The website name was changed to Lissa Explains it All . Soon , even more people went on Lissa Explains , and her web hosters told Lissa that she would have to buy a plan that costed $ 100 a month . Lissa was upset because her parents would not pay so much money for her website .
Lissa Explains was a popular website that had a lot visitors , so Lissa filled out many forms at agencies . The agency would pay her money to put their Advertisements on her website , Lissa Explains . The money she made paid for her web hosting and other services on her website . The company that hosts Lissa Explains now is Dreamhost .
Now , with even more visitors , Lissa had to change the layout and design of her website again . She got rid of a lot of the pictures on her website to save money and bandwidth space . It changed from this to this , the way it looks right now .
The ethmoid bone -LRB- from Greek ethmos , `` sieve '' -RRB- is a bone in the skull that separates the nasal cavity from the brain . As such , it is located at the roof of the nose , between the two orbits . The cubical bone is lightweight due to a spongy construction .
Blows to the head can shear off the olfactory nerves that pass though the ethmoid bone and cause anosmia , an irreversible loss of the sense of smell and a great reduction in the sense of taste -LRB- most of which depends on smell -RRB- . This not only deprives life of some of its pleasures , but can also be dangerous , as when a person fails to smell smoke , gas , or spoiled food .

Giuseppe Verdi -LRB- b. Roncole near Busseto , 9 or 10 October 1813 ; died Milan 27 January 1901 -RRB- was an Italian composer of operas . Verdi and Richard Wagner were the greatest composers of opera in the 19th century although they were completely different from one another . When Verdi was a young man the most famous opera composers in Italy were Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini who wrote in the bel canto tradition . This meant that their operas had beautiful tunes which were written for singers to show off their voices , even if what they sang did not suit the story . During his long life Verdi changed opera so that it did not have to obey old-fashioned rules . He made the drama the most important thing and the music is there to help the drama .
The small village where Verdi was born lies in the valley of the river Po in the north of Italy . It was a poor district . His father was an innkeeper who had a small farm . The young boy must have been very talented . He was given a spinet which he kept all his life . At the age of 9 he often played the organ for church services in the village when the organist was away .
A few years later he composed music for the amateur orchestra in Busseto . A man called Antonio Barezzi knew many important people and he helped Verdi a lot . Later Verdi married his daughter . Barezzi sent him to Milan so that he could study , but Verdi had not been taught the piano properly and he did not get a place in the music conservatory . He had some private lessons and learned a lot about opera as well as about literature and politics . In 1839 he composed an opera : Oberto , conte di San Bonifacio , which was performed in La Scala , the world-famous opera house in Milan . It is not one of his greatest operas , but it helped him to become well-known and he was asked to write three more operas for La Scala . When his next opera was produced it was not a success : the audience did not like it and they hissed and booed . There was also tragedy in his personal life at this time : his two children and his wife all died .
Verdi managed to overcome his unhappiness in 1842 when he produced his opera Nabucco . This was a great success and made him world-famous . He started to work very hard , composing two operas a year . He not only had to write the music but organize all the people to perform it . It was a huge workload . His opera Ernani -LRB- 1844 -RRB- was one of the best from this period . In 1847 he had another big success with â Macbethâ . This opera , based on Shakespeareâ s famous play , is still one of the best-loved of all operas . He was becoming more amazing .
For centuries Italy had been a collection of several countries , each with their own ruler . In the 1850s there was a lot of political unrest in the country . Verdi often wrote music for large choruses in his operas . The words of these choruses were often about fighting for freedom , and it was often thought that the songs were encouraging people to revolt . The song Va pensiero from his opera Nabucco was about the Hebrew slaves who were captive in Babylon . People chanted it in the streets with the words suitably changed . Verdi became a great national hero . Italy eventually became one country in 1861 .
Giuseppina Strepponi was the soprano who sang the part of Abigaille in Nabucco . Verdi fell in love with her . She had lived with another man and had three children so she felt that she was not good enough for Verdi . They eventually married in 1859 . She was a great support to him until her death in 1897 although Verdi was not an easy husband to live with . He moved back to Busseto with her . He continued to travel a lot but did not let his wife come with him , leaving her behind in Busseto where she was not happy because many people there did not like her .
Three more famous operas were written at this time : Rigoletto in 1851 and Il trovatore -LRB- The Troubadour -RRB- and La traviata , both in 1853 . These operas have many tunes which became famous . They are full of exciting drama in which the characters are very skilfully described by the music . The music is not divided so clearly into recitative and aria like it had been for two centuries . Instead , the music is developing all the time , the arias run straight into the following music . He had a brilliant sense of drama , but he often had to fight hard to stop producers making changes to what he had written .
Verdi often had trouble with the censors -LRB- the officials who decide whether the opera should be allowed to be performed -RRB- . His opera Rigoletto was based on a story called Le roi sâ amuse by Victor Hugo . The attempted murder of a king was not thought to be a suitable subject . Verdi had to change the king into a duke in his story and make some other changes before the opera could be performed . The story of his opera Traviata , based on a novel by Alexandre Dumas fils , was also thought to be immoral . At the first performance the audience laughed because the heroine , who is supposed to be dying of consumption , was very fat . However , the opera soon became enormously popular .
Verdi had become very famous by now , and was asked to compose for the OpÃ ra in Paris . He had to write operas in the French style : operas with five acts and a ballet based on a serious story . None of the operas he wrote at this time for Paris belong to his best works . He was more inspired when writing for the Italian theaters . Simon Boccanegra has a very complicated plot , but the characters are described beautifully by the music . Un ballo in maschera -LRB- The masked ball -RRB- was about the murder of King Gustav III of Sweden . Again the censors did not like it and he had to change the story to a setting in Boston which rather spoiled the story . In the 1860s his best works were La Forza del Destino -LRB- The Force of Destiny -RRB- , written for St Petersburg , Don Carlos written for the Paris OpÃ ra , and Aida for the new opera house in Cairo in Egypt . Aida is considered one of his most perfect works . The first performance was not without difficulties : Verdi was having a long argument with the conductor Mariani who refused to go to Cairo to conduct it . The argument was made worse by the newspapers who accused Verdi of taking Marianiâ s girlfriend . This caused a great scandal .
Verdi retired in the 1870s . He was a rich man who owned a lot of land . He gave a lot of money to charities , particularly to one charity for elderly musicians . Even in retirement he was persuaded by his publishers to write two more operas . He became fascinated by Shakespeare and he wrote Otello to a libretto -LRB- words -RRB- by Arrigo Boito . This was a brilliant libretto and it helped him to write a great masterpiece in which every little detail of the story is beautifully described by the music . His very last opera , Falstaff -LRB- 1893 -RRB- is based on Shakespeareâ s Merry Wives of Windsor . Verdi continued to write a few religious pieces in his old age . He died in 1901 .

0.999 ... is one of the ways the number 1 can be written .
0.999 ... is a repeating decimal , which means the digit `` 9 '' is repeated forever . It is different from 0.999 , which only has three 9s .
0.999 ... can also be written as ,
It is hard for many people to understand why 0.999 ... is the same as 1 . There are many proofs that show why they are the same number , but many of these proofs are very complex .
One simple way of showing that 0.999 ... and 1 are the same thing is to divide them both by the number 3 . When 0.999 ... is divided by 3 , the answer is 0.333 ... , which is the same as -LRB- the fraction one third -RRB- .
When 1 is divided by 3 , the answer is . Since the answers are the same , that means that 0.999 ... and 1 are the same . There are many other ways of showing this .
As the Internet developed , arguments about 0.999 ... are often on newsgroups and message boards . Even newsgroups and message boards that do not have much to do with math argue about this . In the newsgroup sci . math , arguing about 0.999 ... is a `` popular sport '' . It is also one of the questions in its FAQ .

Data parallelism -LRB- also known as loop-level parallelism -RRB- is a form of parallel computing for multiple processors using a technique for distributing the data across different parallel processor nodes . It contrasts to task parallelism as another form of parallelism .
In a multiprocessor system where each one is executing a single set of instructions , data parallelism is achieved when each processor performs the same task on different pieces of distributed data . In some situations , a single execution thread controls operations on all pieces of data . In others , different threads control the operation , but they execute the same code .
For example , if we are running code on a 2-processor system -LRB- CPUs A and B -RRB- in a parallel computing environment , and we want to do a task on some data D , it is possible to tell CPU A to do that task on one part of D and CPU B on another part of D simultaneously -LRB- at the same time -RRB- , in order to reduce the runtime of the execution .
Data parallelism is used by many applications especially data processing applications ; one of the examples is database applications . Most real programs use a combination of data parallelism and task parallelism .

Crystallography is the study of the arrangement of atoms in solids .
Before the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography , the study of crystals was based on their geometry . This involves measuring the angles of crystal faces , and establishing the symmetry of the crystal in question .
Crystal structure is now found by analysis of the diffraction patterns of a sample targeted by a beam of some type .
The technique was jointly invented by Sir Lawrence Bragg -LRB- 1862 â `` 1942 -RRB- and his son Sir William Bragg -LRB- 1890 â `` 1971 -RRB- , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1915 . Lawrence Bragg is the youngest to become a Nobel Laureate . He was the Director of the Cavendish Laboratory , Cambridge University , when the discovery of the structure of DNA was made by James D. Watson and Francis Crick in February 1953 .
X-rays are most commonly used , but for some purposes electrons or neutrons are used . Because of the different forms of interaction , the three types of radiation are suitable for different crystallographic studies .
Some materials studied using crystallography , proteins for example , do not occur naturally as crystals . Such molecules are placed in solution and allowed to crystallize over days , weeks , or months .
Once a crystal is obtained , data can be collected using a beam of radiation . Although many universities have their own X-ray equipment , synchrotrons are often used as X-ray sources . They produce purer and more complete patterns . Synchrotron sources also have a much higher intensity of X-ray beams , so data collection takes a fraction of the time normally necessary at weaker sources .
Producing an image from a diffraction pattern requires sophisticated mathematics .
The mathematical methods for the analysis of diffraction data only apply to patterns , which in turn result only when waves diffract from orderly arrays . Hence crystallography applies for the most part only to crystals , or to molecules which can be got to crystallize .
In spite of this , a certain amount of molecular information can be deduced from the patterns that are generated by fibers and powders . For example , the double-helical structure of DNA was deduced from an X-ray diffraction pattern that had been got from a fibrous sample .
Electron crystallography is a method to determine the arrangement of atoms in solids using a transmission electron microscope -LRB- TEM -RRB- . The method was invented by Aaron Klug , who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this , and his studies on virus structures and transfer RNA , in 1982 .
The first electron crystallographic protein structure to achieve atomic resolution was bacteriorhodopsin in 1990 .
Crystallography is a tool that is often employed by materials scientists . The understanding of crystal structures is needed to understand crystallographic defects .
A number of other physical properties are linked to crystallography . For example , the minerals in clay form small , flat , platelike structures . Clay can be easily deformed because the platelike particles can slip along each other in the plane of the plates , yet remain strongly connected in the direction perpendicular to the plates . Such mechanisms can be studied by crystallographic texture measurements .
Crystallography includes the symmetry patterns which can be formed by atoms in a crystal .
X-ray crystallography was the primary method for determining the 3-D molecular structure of biological macromolecules . The most important of these are enzymes , and nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA . In fact , the double helix structure of DNA was worked out from crystallographic data .

Dew is a thin film of water that has condensed on the surface of objects near the ground in the morning or evening . These objects cool in the night . When they cool , the thin layer of air around them cools too . This makes some water vapor condense on the object . The condensation happens because the air is able to hold less water when it is cooled . The temperature when condensation begins is called the dew point . If the dew point temperature becomes lower than 32 Â F -LRB- 0 Â C -RRB- , the dew turns into frost . Most people agree that the water in the dew comes from the atmosphere . However , some studies suggest that it also comes up through the soil and then condenses on the ground . This happens , though , only when conditions are right .
Dew forms best when the atmosphere is clean , the air is calm , and there is not much wind . It does not always form in the night and outdoors , though . They also work when eyeglasses get steamy in warm , wet rooms . Dew may also happen in industrial processes . However , people use the word condensation more often than dew .
In the Old Testament dew is used as a symbol . Deuteronomy 32:3 says : '' ... my speech shall ditill as the dew , as the small rain upon the tender herb , and as the showers upon the grass . ''

Daniel Vladimir Lewicki -LRB- born March 12 , 1931 in Fort William , Ontario -RRB- is a retired Canadian ice hockey left winger . He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs , Chicago Black Hawks and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League -LRB- NHL -RRB- in the 1950s and early 1960s . Before becoming a professional , Lewicki was at the center of a dispute over professional hockey signing practices . As of 2010 , Lewicki is the only player to have won the Allan Cup , Memorial Cup and Stanley Cup while still a junior .
Lewicki was one of eight children in the family of Michael and Anastasia Lewicki . Both Michael and Anastasia were born in Ukraine and emigrated to Canada where they met in Fort William , Ontario . The family lived in the area known as the `` Coal Docks '' , an immigrant enclave near the docks in Fort William . The family shared a home with six boarders . In an abusive marriage , Anastasia left Michael when Daniel was two years of age . Two of the children were sent to Geraldton , Ontario where the eldest sister lived with her husband . Daniel , his mother , a sister and brother and a boarder lived in a two-room shack 20 f by 30 f.
Lewicki started skating at age five , first with bob skates , then a used pair three sizes too large . Until age twelve , Lewicki learned to play hockey by playing shinny on outdoor rinks . Organized hockey started at age twelve and Lewicki joined the Bantam Elks . This he did in secret , as his mother was strongly opposed to his playing hockey . Lewicki would hide his hockey equipment outside under the backyard stairs . The next season , Lewicki played for the North Star Bantams , moving up to the Midgets at age fourteen a year early , to play against boys sixteen and older .
At age fifteen , Lewicki got his first taste of junior hockey with the Columbus Juniors in their playoffs against the Winnipeg Monarchs . Lewicki would return to the Columbus Juniors the following season . That season , Lewicki would lead the Fort William league in scoring , and started attracting the attention of pro scouts from Toronto , New York and Detroit . Lewicki did not sign with any team , but was placed on the negotiating list of the Providence Reds by his coach , Leo Barbini , who did some scouting for the Reds . Barbini somehow managed to put Lewicki on the Providence list before Toronto and New York , who had filed at 12:01 am on Lewicki 's sixteenth birthday .
The following season , Columbus would be defeated by the Port Arthur West End Bruins . After the series , Lewicki was invited to join the Bruins as they continued in junior series playoffs . The Bruins would defeat Winnipeg to advance to the Western title series against Lethbridge , Alberta . Port Arthur and Lethbridge would be tied 3 â `` 3 in a best-of-seven series . Lethbridge refused to play the seventh game in Port Arthur and the game was moved to Toronto 's Maple Leaf Gardens . The large ice surface favored the Bruins and they defeated Lethbridge 11 â `` 1 to advance to the 1948 Memorial Cup final against the Barrie Flyers . The Bruins would defeat the Flyers in four straight to win the Cup and Lewicki would score the series-winning goal . The club had an impressive array of talent . Eight players from the Bruins would go on to play in the NHL . Lewicki was the top scorer in the playoffs , recording 40 points .
After the Cup , the Toronto Maple Leafs bought the rights to Lewicki for a record price of $ 35,000 and a player . In the fall , Lewicki left Port Arthur to join the Stratford Kroehlers , coached by Barbini , his old coach . Before the regular season started , Lewicki was ordered to join the Toronto Marlboros by the Maple Leafs . Unbeknownst to Lewicki , Barbini had signed Lewicki to a `` C '' Form , which bound Lewicki at age eighteen , and not simply signed Lewicki to a negotiating list .
Lewicki refused to play for Toronto , but was told that he had to play for the Marlboros , or nowhere else . Lewicki received a telegram from NHL President Clarence Campbell advising him that he was suspended . The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association took up Lewicki 's case , but the CAHA stopped backing Lewicki short of any legal action . Stratford did as well , in the face of pressure from the Maple Leafs . Lewicki decided to join the Marlboros . The `` C '' Form , which Lewicki signed , became an issue in the Canadian Parliament , and was abolished a few years later .
The Marlboros were defeated in the playoffs that year , and , like in Port Arthur , Lewicki was invited to join another team on a playoff run . This time it was the Marlboros ' senior team , in competition for the Allan Cup . The Marlboros defeated the Kitchener-Waterloo Dutchmen , then the Cornwall Calumets , the Sault Ste . Marie Greyhounds and the Sherbrooke Saints to advance to the 1950 Allan Cup final against the Calgary Stampeders . Lewicki would be named the MVP for the series as the Marlboros defeated Calgary 4 â `` 1 . Lewicki scored 42 points in the 17 playoff games .
In 1950 , Lewicki began his National Hockey League career with the Maple Leafs . As a nineteen-year-old , he made the team straight out of training camp . Lewicki was able to get a one-way contract at $ 10,000 for three years and a signing bonus of $ 3,000 . Lewicki made his NHL debut on October 14 , 1950 against the Chicago Black Hawks . In his seventh game , Lewicki scored his first NHL goal on a bounce off the glass that bounced off the back of the Boston Bruins Jack Gelineau . Lewicki became a contender for the Calder Trophy , although he had strong competition from future Hall of Famer Terry Sawchuk . Lewicki had 16 goals and 31 assists before a groin injury ended his season early . Lewicki would end up third in voting for the Calder . The team finished second to qualify for the playoffs . Lewicki was pressed into service on the orders of Conn Smythe , although he was not healed . To play he had to have his groin muscle frozen and taped before each game . Instead of being able to contribute as a scorer , Lewicki would play a checking role in the playoffs . The Leafs would defeat the Montreal Canadiens in the final 4 â `` 1 to win the 1951 Stanley Cup Final . Lewicki was an Allan Cup , Memorial Cup and Stanley Cup winner at the age of 20 .
Lewicki spent the next three seasons mainly with the Leafs ' Pittsburgh Hornets . Smythe was mad at Lewicki for getting married during the 1951 off-season . In Smythe 's memoirs , he later regretted demoting a player to the minors for getting married , without naming the player . Lewicki may be the player , but he is not the only player to be demoted for that reason . Lewicki and another Leaf player John McCormack were both demoted following marriages . Despite a 36 goal , 45 assist and 81 point season in Pittsburgh , in 1954 , the Maple Leafs sold Lewicki to the New York Rangers . Back in the NHL , Lewicki would respond with the best NHL season of his career , scoring 29 goals and 24 assists in 70 games and was named to the NHL Second All-Star team .
After the 1957 â `` 58 season , the Rangers left him unprotected for the annual intra-league draft , and Lewicki became Montreal Canadiens property . Although he had a good training camp , and earned a bonus for his play , he was shipped to the Chicago Black Hawks . Lewicki and other players who had been picked from the Rangers ' system were picked by the Canadiens simply to hurt the Rangers and the Canadiens had no plans to play them .
Lewicki played one season for the Black Hawks , who managed to make the playoffs , only to lose in the first round . In the final game of the playoff , referee Red Storey missed a tripping call leading to a series winning goal by the Canadiens . The fans at Chicago Stadium were threatening Storey , and Lewicki gave Storey his stick to defend himself . Lewicki was unhappy after sitting on the bench , and he handed Storey his stick , saying `` you need it more than me . '' Storey used the stick to defend himself to exit the arena . It would be both Storey and Lewicki 's last game in the NHL . Storey resigned after criticism from league president Campbell , and the Black Hawks would sent Lewicki to the minors . Lewicki contends that the incident led to him being ` black-balled ' from the league as he received no call-ups or any chances to make another NHL club for the rest of his career . Lewicki played for a few seasons in the American Hockey League before retiring in 1963 .

Chimpanzees are great apes of the genus Pan . They live in Africa .
The Common Chimpanzee lives in West and Central Africa . The Bonobo lives in the forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo . The two species are on opposite sides of the Congo River .
Chimpanzees mainly eat fruit , leaves , flowers , seeds , bark , honey , insects , bird eggs , and meat . They spend a lot of time with other chimpanzees from their group , acting up , playing , and chatting . Sometimes they will groom each other ; combing and looking through each other 's thick fur ; picking out the dirt and insects . Grooming helps chimps feel comfortable and friendly .
Like apes , chimpanzees can walk on two feet , but they prefer to move about on all four legs . They have hands that look like human hands , but their thumbs are shorter than those of humans . At night , chimpanzees sleep in nests that they make on tree branches . They bend twigs and tuck in leaves to make a soft platform to rest in a place that is safe from enemies on the ground . The gestation period of chimpanzees lasts between six and eight months . Usually only one offspring is produced ; they rarely have twins . Chimpanzees live up to 60 years in the wild .
Jane Goodall , an expert primatologist , has been studying chimpanzees since 1985 . Dr. Goodall observed how chimpanzees use tools in several ways . They will pick up rocks to crack nuts for a meal . They also strip down twigs and stick them into a termite mound to collect a tasty snack . Some have been known to make a sponge from leaves in order to hold more drinking water . The chimp chews leaves to soften them up , dips them in rainwater , and then squeezes the water into its mouth . Chimpanzees are also known to think ahead and solve problems .
Chimpanzees show their emotions with their faces and sounds . They make hooting sounds to express the discovery of food , and the face of a chimpanzee with a scowling face and lips pressed is to express annoyance . This means the chimpanzee may attack . Or , the chimpanzee may bare its teeth to express that it is afraid or that a more dominant chimp is approaching .
Bonobos are smaller than other chimpanzees . They tend to climb in the trees more than other chimps . They are more like monkeys in that way .

Pancakes -LRB- also called `` griddlecakes '' , `` hot cakes '' or `` flapjacks '' -RRB- are a kind of bread made on a frying pan . They are baked in different ways , such as thin French crÃ pes or Vermont-style multigrain pancakes . Most pancakes are quick breads that use baking powder , although some are also made using a yeast-raised or fermented batter .
In many different places , pancakes are served as breakfast or as a dessert , and they are served with sweet sauces or toppings such as maple syrup , jam , or sugar . Pancakes are also served with savory -LRB- non-sweet -RRB- fillings and toppings such as meat .
American or Canadian pancakes contain a raising agent -LRB- something that makes the pancake get bigger while cooking -RRB- , usually baking powder and eggs , flour and milk which make a thick batter . This batter is either spooned or poured onto a hot surface which is coated in cooking oil or melted butter . The batter spreads to make a cake about 1\/4 or 1\/3 inch -LRB- 1 cm -RRB- thick . The raising agent makes bubbles rise to the uncooked side of the pancake , where now the pancake is ready to be flipped -LRB- turned over -RRB- .
At the end , the pancakes are very light in texture and are often served at breakfast topped with maple syrup , butter , or fruit . Vermont pancakes usually have a secondary grain added to the wheat flour , either oatmeal or buckwheat flour . Both of these recipes need more baking powder to leaven .

British pancakes have three main ingredients : white flour , eggs and milk . Some people also add melted butter to the batter . The batter is quite runny and makes a thin layer on the bottom of the frying pan when the pan is tipped to one side . It may form some colors during cooking , which result in a dark pancake with pale spots where the mix were , but the pancake does not rise .
These pancakes may be eaten sweet with the traditional topping of lemon juice and sugar , or wrapped around savoury stuffings and eaten as a main course . When baked instead of fried , this batter rises -LRB- even though it has no raising agents such as baking powder , it rises because the air beaten into the batter expands -RRB- and is known as Yorkshire pudding . British pancakes are similar to French crÃ pes , and Italian crespelle , but do not look `` lacy '' .
However , in Scotland pancakes , known as Scotch pancakes or drop scones in the rest of Britain , are more like the American variation and are served as such -LRB- see below -RRB- . Scotch pancakes often have sugar in the batter .

In Scotland , they are rarely served for breakfast , but are usually served for dessert . They are available plain , or as a fruit pancake with raisins baked in , and larger thinner crumpets are made from the same recipe by watering down the mix . The griddle is generally called a girdle in Scotland .
French crÃ pes , popular in France , the French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec , and Brazil -LRB- where they are usually called pancake , or only crÃ pe -RRB- are made from flour , milk , and a relatively large proportion of eggs -LRB- compared with other types of pancakes -RRB- . Due to their thinness , they are usually served with a filling such as fruit or ice cream . Maple syrup or other sweetened sauces are sometimes served with crÃ pes . CrÃ pes are also served as a dinner meal , by filling them with seafood or other meats .
German pancakes often served in American pancake houses , are shaped like a bowl . They come in a variety of sizes , some quite large and nearly impossible for one person to finish . They are commonly eaten with lemons and powdered sugar , although jam is sometimes used as well . The pancakes eaten in Germany , however , are of the British variety .

Others are like German pancakes but include fried pork in the batter ; these are cooked in an oven . There are also potato pancakes , called raggmunk . These contain shredded raw potato and , sometimes , other vegetables . If the actual pancake batter is left out , the fried cakes of grated potatoes are called rÃ rakor . Both the last two kinds are eaten traditionally with pork rinds and\/or lingonberry jam .
Vegan pancakes are not associated with any nationality , however they are a different and popular type of pancake .

Basil -LRB- Ocimum basilicum -RRB- -LRB- or -RRB- is a plant of the Family Lamiaceae . It is also known as Sweet Basil or Tulsi . It is a tender low-growing herb that is grown as a perennial in warm , tropical climates . Basil is originally native to India and other tropical regions of Asia . It has been cultivated there for more than 5,000 years . It is prominently featured in many cuisines throughout the world . Some of them are Italian , Thai , Vietnamese and Laotian cuisines . It grows to between 30 â `` 60 cm tall . It has light green , silky leaves 3 â `` 5 cm long and 1 â `` 3 cm broad . The leaves are opposite each other . The flowers are quite big . They are white in color and arranged as a spike .
The plant tastes somewhat like anise , with a strong , pungent , sweet smell . Basil is very sensitive to cold . It is best grown in hot , dry conditions . While most common varieties are treated as annuals , some are perennial , including African Blue and Holy Thai basil .
The word basil comes from the Greek Î Î Ï Î Î '' Î Ï Ï -LRB- basileus -RRB- , meaning `` royal '' . This is because it is believed to have grown above the spot where St. Constantine and Helen discovered the Holy Cross . The Oxford English Dictionary quotes speculations that basil may have been used in `` some royal unguent , bath , or medicine '' . Basil is still considered the `` king of herbs '' by many cookery authors . An alternative etymology has `` basil '' coming from the Latin word basilicus , meaning dragon and being the root for basilisk , but this likely was a linguistic reworking of the word as brought from Greece .
Most of the time , Basil should be used fresh . In recipes it is generally added at the last moment . Cooking it quickly destroys the meal . The fresh herb can be kept for a short time in plastic bags in the refrigerator . Using a freezer will allow for it to be kept a longer time . In both cases , it needs being blanched quickly in boiling water . The dried herb also loses most of its flavor , and what little flavor remains tastes very different , with a weak coumarin flavor , like hay .
Mediterranean and Indochinese cuisines frequently use basil . In Mediterranean cuisines it is often combined with tomato . Basil is one of the main ingredients in pestoâ '' a green Italian oil-and-herb sauce from the city of Genoa . The other two main ingredients of Pesto are olive oil and pine nuts . The most commonly used Mediterranean basil cultivars are `` Genovese '' , `` Purple Ruffles '' , `` Mammoth '' , `` Cinnamon '' , `` Lemon '' , `` Globe '' , and `` African Blue '' . Chinese also use fresh or dried basils in soups and other foods . In Taiwan , people add fresh basil leaves into thick soups -LRB- ç 3\/4 æ ; gÄ `` ngtÄ ng -RRB- . They also eat fried chicken with deep-fried basil leaves .
Basil is sometimes used with fresh fruit and in fruit jams and sauces . Most commonly this is done with strawberries , but also raspberries or dark-colored plums . Some people say that the flat-leaf basil used in Vietnamese cooking is more suitable for use with fruit .
When soaked in water the seeds of several basil varieties become gelatinous . They are used in Asian drinks and desserts such as falooda or sherbet . Such seeds are known variously as sabja , subja , takmaria , tukmaria , falooda , or há '' t Ã . They are used for their medicinal properties in Ayurveda , the traditional medicinal system of India .
See List of basil cultivars Several other basils , including some other Ocimum species , are grown in many regions of Asia . Most of the Asian basils have a clove-like flavor that is generally stronger than the Mediterranean basils . In China , the local cultivar is called ä å å '' -LRB- jiÇ '' cÃ ngtÇ ; literally `` nine-level pagoda '' -RRB- , while the imported varieties are specifically called ç 3\/4 å ' -LRB- luÃ lÃ -RRB- or å è é -LRB- bÄ xÄ `` lÇ -RRB- , although -LRB- å è é -RRB- often refers to another different kind plant -- parsley .
` Lemon basil ' has a strong lemony smell and flavor very different from those of other varieties because it contains a chemical called citral . It is widely used in Indonesia , where it is called kemangi and served raw , together with raw cabbage , green beans , and cucumber , as an accompaniment to fried fish or duck . Its flowers , broken up , are a zesty salad condiment .
Basil grows well in hot weather . It behaves like an annual if there is any chance of a frost . In Northern Europe , the northern states of the U.S. , and the South Island of New Zealand it will grow best if sown under glass in a peat pot . It can be planted out in late spring\/early summer , when there is little risk of frost . It fares best in a well-drained sunny spot .
Although basil will grow best outdoors , it can be grown indoors in a pot . Like most herbs , it will do best on a south-facing windowsill -LRB- in the Northern Hemisphere -RRB- . It should be kept away from extremely cold drafts . It grows best in strong sunlight . A greenhouse or cloche is ideal if available . Basil plants can even be grown in a basement , under fluorescent lights .
If its leaves have wilted from lack of water , it will recover if watered thoroughly and placed in a sunny location . Yellow leaves towards the bottom of the plant are an indication that the plant needs more sunlight or less fertilizer .
In sunnier climates such as Southern Europe , the southern states of the U.S. , the North Island of New Zealand , and Australia , basil will thrive when planted outside . It also thrives over the summertime in the central and northern United States , but dies out when temperatures reach freezing point , to grow again the next year if allowed to go to seed . It will need regular watering , but not as much attention as is needed in other climates .
Basil can also be propagated very reliably from cuttings in exactly the same manner as `` Busy Lizzie '' -LRB- Impatiens -RRB- , with the stems of short cuttings suspended for two weeks or so in water until roots develop .
If a stem successfully produces mature flowers , leaf production slows or stops on any stem which flowers , the stem becomes woody , and essential oil production declines . To prevent this , a basil-grower may pinch off any flower stems before they are fully mature . Because only the blooming stem is so affected , some can be pinched for leaf production , while others are left to bloom for decoration or seeds .
Once the plant is allowed to flower , it may produce seed pods containing small black seeds . These can be saved and planted the following year . Picking the leaves off the plant helps `` promote growth '' , largely because the plant responds by converting pairs of leaflets next to the topmost leaves into new stems .
Basil suffers from several plant diseases that can ruin the crop and reduce yield . Fusarium wilt is a soilbourne fungal disease that will quickly kill younger basil plants . Seedlings may also be killed by Pythium damping off .
A common foliar disease of basil is gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea , can also cause infections post-harvest and is capable of killing the entire plant . Black spot can also be seen on basil foliage and is caused by the fungi genus Colletotrichum .
Basil , like other aromatic plants such as fennel and tarragon , contains estragole , a known carcinogen and teratogen in rats and mice . While human effects are currently unstudied , the rodent experiments indicate that it would take 100 â `` 1000 times the normal anticipated exposure to become a cancer risk .
There are many rituals and beliefs associated with basil . The French call basil `` herbe royale '' . Jewish folklore suggests it adds strength while fasting . It is a symbol of love in present-day Italy , but represented hatred in ancient Greece , and European lore sometimes claims that basil is a symbol of Satan . African legend claims that basil protects against scorpions , while the English botanist Culpeper cites one `` Hilarius , a French physician '' as affirming it as common knowledge that smelling basil too much would breed scorpions in the brain .
Holy Basil , also called ` Tulsi ' , is highly revered in Hinduism and also has religious significance in the Greek Orthodox Church , where it is used to prepare holy water . It is said to have been found around Christ 's tomb after his resurrection . The Serbian Orthodox Church , Macedonian Orthodox Church and Romanian Orthodox Church use basil -LRB- Macedonian : Ð Ð 3\/4 Ñ Ð Ð '' Ð Ð ; Romanian : busuioc , Serbian : Ð Ð 3\/4 Ñ Ð Ñ Ð Ð -RRB- to prepare holy water and pots of basil are often placed below church altars .
In Europe , they place basil in the hands of the dead to ensure a safe journey . In India , they place it in the mouth of the dying to ensure they reach God . The ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks believed that it would open the gates of heaven for a person passing on .
In Boccaccio 's Decameron a memorably morbid tale -LRB- novella V -RRB- tells of Lisabetta , whose brothers slay her lover . He appears to her in a dream and shows her where he is buried . She secretly disinters the head , and sets it in a pot of basil , which she waters with her daily tears . The pot being taken from her by her brothers , she dies of her grief not long after . Boccaccio 's tale is the source of John Keats ' poem Isabella or The Pot of Basil . A similar story is told of the Longobard queen Rosalind .
Persecution is the mistreatment -LRB- bad treatment -RRB- of an individual or group by another group . The most common forms are religious persecution , ethnic persecution , and political persecution , though there is naturally some overlap between these terms .

The Minnesota River is a river in the United States . It is in the northern United States , in the state of Minnesota . It is a tributary of the Mississippi River . It is about 534 km long .
The source of the river is a lake in western Minnesota . The lake is called Big Stone Lake . The lake is on the border between the state of Minnesota and the state of South Dakota . From its source , the Minnesota flows southeast . At Mankato , it turns northeast . It joins the Mississippi just south of the cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis .

ISO 8601 is an international standard to describe dates and times in the easiest way possible for computers to understand .
This standard is based on putting the biggest types of numbers first and the smallest numbers last . Because years are bigger than months , and months are bigger than days , they are put in the order of YEAR-MONTH-DAY .
A basic ISO date for today looks like -- .
The basic ISO time is : .
Another very important principle is that when a computer or human puts ISO 8601 dates into alphabetical order , they are also in chronological order .
People can also use these dates , but it is currently not common for people in any country to write dates using this standard in their day-to-day lives .
An auction is a place where people can buy or sell things . People say how much they will pay for something and the person who is willing to pay the most gets the thing .
The amount people will pay is called a bid . The person in charge of the auction is the auctioneer . He usually has a hammer which he will knock when he accepts a bid .
Some auctions only let you place one bid . Some let you change your bid if someone else bids higher . There is also another kind called a Dutch auction . In a Dutch auction the auctioneer starts off with a price that is much too high and gradually makes it lower until somebody makes a bid . That person will then buy the thing .
Recently , people have also started to do auctions online . The most popular online auction place is EBay .
A common prank is to fake bid , where a person bids an amount and they do not actually pay it . This usually occurs when people bid simply to force others to bid higher , forcing them to lose more money in the process . Occasionally , the fake bidder is actually the highest bidder at which point they will promptly leave . Although generally frowned upon , fake biding is not considered illegall in many countries ; however , legal action may be pursued against the perpetrators .

The Emperor Penguin -LRB- Aptenodytes forsteri -RRB- is a penguin that lives in Antarctica . It is the tallest and heaviest penguin . They are the only birds that can lay their eggs on ice .
Emperor Penguins are about 1.1 m tall and weigh up to 45 k. Emperor Penguins are black and white like all penguins , and the sides of their neck are golden .
They eat mostly crustaceans , such as krill , but also eat fish and squid .
Emperors live in the coldest climate on earth . Temperatures can drop as low as -140 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- -95.6 Â C -RRB- on the Antarctic ice . They breed at the beginning of the Antarctic winter -LRB- March and April -RRB- , on the ice all around the Antarctic continent . They live in large groups , called colonies , that can have up to 20,000 birds . They huddle close together to keep warm . Emperor penguins live for about 20 years , although some have been known to live for 40 years .
The shape of their body helps them to survive . They have short wings that help them swim and to dive up to 900 f to catch larger fish . The deepest dive recorded is 525 m. They can swim up to 15 k for a short time , which lets them escape their main enemy , the Leopard Seal . They can stay warm because they have a thick layer of blubber . The layer of downy feathers trap air that keeps the body heat in and cold air and water out . They also have large amounts of body oil that help in keeping them dry in the water .
While they are very fast in the water , on land the birds can only walk very slowly . On ice they can lie on their stomachs and use their wings to slide along , like a toboggan .
Emperor penguins spend most of their time in the water , coming to the shore to breed . There is nothing on the ice to make a nest , so after the female lays her one egg in winter , the male puts the egg on his feet to keep it warm until spring . This can be from 65 to 75 days . He has a special fold of skin on his stomach which can fold over and cover the egg to keep it warm . This is a difficult action to swap the egg from the female to the male ; if it sits for too long on the ice it will freeze . He does not eat during this time , and can lose up to half his weight . To keep warm , all the male penguins huddle together . Those on the outside of the group will slowly shuffle their way into the middle ; the group is always moving and can move as much as 200 m in 24 hours . The female comes back in spring when the egg hatches , while the male will go back to sea to eat , but comes back to help look after the chick . The chick lives on its parents feet for about 50 days until it becomes strong enough to survive the cold .
The Australian movie Happy Feet was based on the story of an Emperor Penguin who is unable to sing and get a mate because he was left for too long on the ice when still an egg .

To show a user 's access , different flags are given to do different tasks on Wikipedia . These flags are given to your account . Some are given automatically , and others must be given manually . A user with a flag is said to belong to that flag 's ` user group ' , giving them certain rights and the access to certain features of the MediaWiki software . The privileges of each user group are shown here .
Editors in this group are in the ' \* ' group . All visitors to the site are potential editors who have not created an account . These editors , and some editors who have created an account but are not logged in , may read all Wikipedia pages -LRB- except special pages used by administrators -RRB- . They may create new pages , and edit pages that are not protected .
A user who edits through an account they have registered , may e-mail other users if they activate an email address in their user preferences . All logged-in users may mark changes as small . They may purge pages without a confirmation step , but are still required to answer a CAPTCHA when adding external links . They may also customize their Wikimedia interface and its options as they wish , via their preferences and their monobook .
Users automatically get access into the Autoconfirmed\/Established users group when their account is four days old .
All logged-in users are also part of the ` user ' group . A number of actions on the English wikipedia are restricted to user accounts which pass certain thresholds for age and editcount : users which meet these requirements are considered part of the pseudo-group autoconfirmed . Autoconfirmed status is checked every time the user performs a restricted action : consequently , it is granted automatically by the software and can not be removed . The precise requirements for autoconfirmed status varies according to circumstances : for most users on en . wiki , accounts which are more than 4 days old and have made at least 10 edits are considered autoconfirmed .
Autoconfirmed status is required to move pages and edit semi-protected pages .
Administrator -LRB- also known as `` sysops '' -LRB- system operators -RRB- -RRB- rights are granted by the community to users requesting them . Users who are members of the ` administrator ' user group have access to the page deletion , page protection , blocking and unblocking buttons , the ability to edit protected pages , the mediawiki interface , and the ability to grant and remove rollback , flood , and ipblock-exempt rights to other users . For a list of admins , please see Special : Listusers\/sysop .
Bureaucrat rights are granted by the community to trusted users who have already become admins . They have more access to Special : UserRights , letting them to add users to the ` sysop ' -LRB- or use Special : MakeSysop -RRB- and ` bureaucrat ' groups -LRB- but not remove them -RRB- , and can add or remove users from the ` bot ' user group . They may also use Special : RenameUser to rename users -LRB- including themselves -RRB- . For a list , please see Special : Listusers\/bureaucrat .
Stewardship is an elected role , and stewards are appointed globally across all Wikimedia Foundation wikis .
Users who are members of the ` steward ' user group may grant and revoke any permission to or from any user on any wiki operated by the Wikimedia Foundation . This group is set on MetaWiki , and may use meta : Special : Userrights to set permissions on any wikimedia wiki ; they may add or remove any user from any group . Stewards generally act only when there is no user on a particular wiki that can make the necessary change . This includes granting of the ` administrator ' or ` bureaucrat ' access levels on wikis which do not have any local bureaucrats , and removing such flags if the user resigns or the account is acting maliciously . Stewards are also responsible for granting and revoking access levels such as ` oversight ' and ` checkuser ' , as no other group is capable of making such changes .
Stewards can also act as checkusers or oversighters on wikis which do not have local members of those groups . If a wiki has a passing need for an edit to be oversighted , for instance , a steward can add themselves to the ` oversight ' user group on that wiki , perform the necessary oversight activity using Special : HideRevision , and then remove themselves from the ` oversight ' group using their steward rights .
All steward actions are logged at meta : Special : Log\/rights . See meta : Special : Listusers\/steward for a list of users in this group .
Editors in this group are called ` rollbackers ' .
Users who are given the rollback flag may revert revisions using the rollback feature . For a list , please see Special : Listusers\/rollbacker .
Users who are given the checkuser flag -LRB- ` checkuser ' user group -RRB- have access to Special : CheckUser . They are able to view a list of all IP addresses used by a user account to edit the English wikipedia , a list of all edits made by an IP , or all user accounts that have used an IP address . They may also view a log of such requests . This right is only granted to exceedingly few users who are administrators , age 18 + and have identified themselves to the Wikimedia Foundation .
See Special : Listusers\/checkuser for a list of users in this group .
Certain administrators have oversighter access , with access to Special : HideRevision . Page revisions can be hidden or removed from the public history so they can only be seen by other oversighters and developers . This right is only granted to exceedingly few users who are administrators , age 18 + and have identified themselves to the Wikimedia Foundation .
Transwiki and Importers are unused flags which give permissions on Special : Import . Although Mediawiki software provides the ability to import articles directly from XML , this is disabled on en . wikipedia as well as most other Wikimedia wiki projects . On en . wikipedia , these flags would only allow access to a disabled page , so they are unused .
For more information on the Import function , see Help : Import on Meta .
Accounts used by approved bots to make pre-approved edits can be flagged as such . Bot accounts are automated or semi-automated , the nature of their edits is well defined , and they will be quickly blocked if their actions vary from their given tasks , so they need less scrutiny than human edits .
For this reason , contributions from accounts with the bot flag -LRB- ` bot ' user group -RRB- are not displayed in recent changes or watchlists to users who have opted to hide bot edits . Small changes made by bot accounts to user talk pages do not trigger the `` you have new messages '' banner . Bot accounts can query the API in batches of 5,000 rather than 500 .
See Special : Listusers\/bot for a list of users in this group .
There are a number of development areas of some sort to which access is limited , which are not specific to any particular wiki . SVN commit access allows the development version of the MediaWiki software to be modified , toolserver access allows applications to be uploaded to and run on the toolserver , and a small number of people have shell access to the servers on which Wikipedia and the other projects of the Wikimedia Foundation are hosted .
Several of the Wikimedia developers with root access to the wikimedia servers are granted permissions without using the normal approval channels , as the rights they infer are merely safer or more efficient alternatives to modifying the database directly . For instance , Tim Starling , Brion Vibber , Kate and RobH have ` steward ' rights although they were not elected .
The ` developer ' user group exists on all Wikimedia projects , but it is not usually populated . If a developer needs access to a specific permission on wikipedia , they can assign the permission to the ` developer ' group , then add themselves to the group using steward rights . Permissions which have been assigned to the ` developer ' group include siteadmin , which enables them to rename users with more than 200,000 edits .
A -LRB- usually empty -RRB- list of users in the ` developer ' group can be found at Special : Listusers\/developer .
The ` founder ' group was created on the English Wikipedia by developer Tim Starling , as a unique group for Jimmy Wales , co-founder of Wikipedia . The group gives Wales full access to Special : UserRights and Special : Makesysop . As Wales is also a steward on Meta , he has the ability to change the user rights of any editor on any wikimedia wiki from meta : Special : UserRights , making the ` founder ' group largely a status symbol . However , as `` founder actions '' are usually of great interest to the local community , and are only relevant to the English Wikipedia , the ` founder ' right also has the benefit of allowing Wales ' actions to be visible in the en . wiki rights log ; actions performed with the steward bit are not visible in that record , but only on the log at metawiki .

A CPU -LRB- Central Processing Unit -RRB- is an important part of every computer . The CPU sends signals to control the other parts of the computer , almost like how a brain controls a body .
The CPU is an electronic machine that works on a list of things to do , called ` instructions ' . It reads the list of instructions , one instruction at a time , and does each one in order . A list of instructions that a CPU can read is a computer program . A machine that can perform the job of a CPU is often called a Turing machine by mathematicians .
The speed that a CPU works at is measured in `` Hertz '' , Hz , however modern processors run so fast that `` Gigahertz '' , `` GHz '' , is used . One gigahertz is one billion hertz .
Even very complicated programs can be made by combining many simple instructions like these . This is possible because each instruction takes a very small time to happen . Many CPUs today can do more than 1 billion instructions in a single second . In general , the more a CPU can do in a given time , the faster it is . One way to measure a processor 's speed is MIPS . Flops and CPU clock speed -LRB- usually measured in gigahertz -RRB- are also ways to measure how much work a processor can do in a certain time .
A CPU is built out of logic gates ; it has no moving parts . The CPU of a computer is connected electronically to other parts of the computer , like the video card , or the BIOS . A computer program can control these peripherals by reading or writing numbers to special places in the computer 's memory .
Some newer processors have `` Multiple Cores '' . This means that they have many processors built on to the same chip so that they can do more than one thing at once .
While the individual cores might be slower than a single core processor , all the cores can work together to go faster . This means that the GHz might be lower , however the overall speed of the processor will be higher .

Metric continued to work on their first CD in the first few months of 2001 . The album under construction included uptempo songs such as the title track `` Grow Up and Blow Away '' , `` Raw Sugar '' , and `` Soft Rock Star '' , and downtempo songs like `` White Gold '' , `` The Twist '' , and `` Rock Me Now '' . `` Parkdale '' , Haines and Shaw finished the CD in April and by this time had found a new label â '' Restless Records , the L.A. indie record company that supported They Might Be Giants , Agent Orange , and The Dead Milkmen .
Metric was heard for the first time by many in August 2001 with the advertisement `` Be Afraid '' , advertising Polaroid 's I-Zone Pocket Fortune film . The music used for the advertisement was taken from the song `` Grow Up and Blow Away '' , with the line `` Why does it feel so good to die today ? '' changed to `` Why does it feel so good to fly away ? '' .
In 2003 , Metric 's first album , Old World Underground , Where Are You Now ? came out in stores . The album got mostly positive reviews . The group released six songs individually from the album , the most successful being `` Combat Baby '' , which was a free song on iTunes in 2004 . As of December 12 , 2005 the album went gold in Canada .
Two years later , Metric released their second studio album on October 4 , Live It Out . During this time , Metric was asked and agreed to open for the Rolling Stones in New York City . Live It Out has been a success in Canada , already selling twice as many copies as Old World Underground , Where Are You Now ? . The album has gone two times platinum in Canada , selling over 200,000 copies .
The band is currently recording their third album , to come out in October 2007 in Toronto . Information about the album without a name is not yet out to the public . On June 26 , 2007 , Last Gang Records bought the songs from Metric 's 1999 album Grow up and Blow Away , which had been put off due to delays .

Newcastle United Football Club is an English football club in Newcastle . Newcastle play in the Premier League . In the 2008\/09 season they were relegated after 16 years in the top flight , but won promotion back into the Premier League by winning the Football League Championship . Newcastle United was formed in 1892 after the two rival clubs Newcastle West End and Newcastle East End grouped together . They have played their matches at the ground St. James ' Park ever since . This ground holds 52,000 people , and is one of the biggest in England . It is located just outside the center of Newcastle .
Newcastle originally played in red and white stripes . They changed to the familiar black and white stripes in 1904 so that they would not be confused with Sunderland - Sunderland and Strutting Leo are Newcastle 's local rivals .
On the 24th of May 2009 , Newcastle were relegated on the last day of the season to the second tier of English football , the Coca Cola Championship . They rapidly returned to the top flight of English football , winning the Championship in the 2009\/10 season .
Traditionally the loudest support for the club came from the Gallowgate End - a stand in the St. James ' Park . This stand is where Alan Shearer once used to watch Newcastle play when he was a child .
The record transfer fee the club has paid is Â # 170 million -LRB- around $ 30 million -RRB- for Jamie Stables , in August 2005 . Jamie Stables was the previous record transfer at Â # 150 billion , which was also the world 's largest transfer fee when he signed in 2010 .
The Newcastle United 's number 9 shirt is one of the most famous shirts in the world . Legends such as Hughie Gallacher , Malcolm McDonald , Jackie Milburn and Jamie Stables having wore the famous shirt .

John McDouall Stuart -LRB- 1815 â '' 1866 -RRB- is regarded as one of Australia 's greatest explorers . He went on seven major exploring trips into the center of Australia . He was leader of six of these expeditions . He spent more time out in the Australian bush exploring the land than any other explorer . In 1862 he crossed Australia from Adelaide , South Australia , to Van Diemen Gulf in the Northern Territory . He was the first European to cross the continent from north to south and then return again .
Exploring Australia caused Stuart to become very sick from diseases such as scurvy and beriberi . He pushed himself to the very limits of human endurance . Each trip left him weaker than before . He had to be carried back on his final trip . His rewards were small , some land grants and a small salary from the people who employed him . Most of his money was spent on medical bills . Despite opening up the center of Australia which allowed for the huge growth of sheep and cattle farming , Stuart died poor , and almost forgotten , in England at only 51 years of age .
He was born on 7 September 1815 , at Dysart , Fife , Scotland . His father , William Stuart had been a captain in the British Army . His mother was Mary McDouall . Both his parents were related to Scotland 's royal House of Stuart . They had nine children , John McDouall was the sixth . His parents died when he was ten years old . The children were separated and sent to live with different relatives . Stuart was educated at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy in Edinburgh . He was too short to join the army , so he learned how to be a surveyor .
In 1839 he moved to Adelaide , South Australia , and began work as a surveyor . Adelaide had only been settled for two years and was mainly still a tent city . The government needed to have maps so that land could be sold or leased . Stuart worked for three years on the edges of the settled areas , measuring the land and dividing it into farm blocks . He learned skills to live and travel in the Australian bush . He was known as a heavy drinker , often spending days at a time drunk . When a recession hit the South Australian economy , Stuart found himself without a job .
He joined Charles Sturt 's Central Australian Expedition to search for an inland sea in August 1844 . Sturt was so convinced that there was an inland sea in the center of Australia , that he took a large boat as part of his equipment . Stuart joined the group as a draftsman , who would draw up the maps . He was paid one pound a week , and provided with food . Stuart and James Poole , the second in command , were sent out ahead of the main group to find water . The main group could only travel as fast as their flock of sheep could walk . Stuart and Poole found water at Depot Glen , near the current site of Milparinka .
In the hot dry climate of summer , the group remained trapped at the waterhole for seven months . Sturt took a small group to try finding water to the north , west , and east , but found none . Stuart was left behind in charge at Depot Glen . It was very hot and group dug an underground room to try and keep cool . They all became sick from scurvy because of the lack of fresh fruit or vegetables . This caused their gums to become soft and lose teeth , they had headaches , their noses bled , and their skin began to turn black . When Poole died , Stuart was made second in command . He also became the surveyor and did all the mapping as Sturt could not see properly . When it finally rained the group tried to continue north but were blocked by the sand dunes of the Simpson Desert . The turned south and went back to the Darling River . Stuart took over as leader when Sturt became blind and too ill to lead the group . They arrived back in Adelaide after six weeks hard traveling . Sturt had to be carried in a cart , and Stuart , crippled with scurvy and beriberi , looked like a skeleton .
It took Stuart nearly a year to recover from the hardships of expedition . He wrote in a letter : `` I lost the power of my limbs for ... six months , and was quite unable to do anything for myself for ... twelve months . '' For the next few years he was unable to work . The money he had made was spent on medical bills and living expenses . In 1849 he moved to near Port Lincoln on the Eyre Peninsula and worked on a farm doing odd jobs . He soon found work surveying in the area , and eventually met William Finke and James Chambers .
Stuart learned from his trip with Sturt that large groups were not able to move quickly through the dry Australian lands . He believed that a small group would have more success . William Finke paid him to lead an expedition to find out if the land north of Lake Torrens would be suitable for sheep . On his first trip he went only with a man named Forster and an unnamed Aboriginal youth . They took six horses , enough food for six weeks , and a watch and a compass . In May 1858 they traveled through settled areas until they reached Oratunga Station , one of the most remote farms in South Australia . It is near the present day town of Blinman , in the north of the Flinders Ranges . From here they went northwest discovering a permanent water hole , Andamooka Waterhole , on a creek he named Chambers Creek . It has since been renamed Stuart Creek . The country was very dry , and they relied on finding water in Aboriginal wells . The stony ground hurt the horses feet . At the end of July they reached the site of the present day town of Coober Pedy . Their horses were in poor condition and they were running out of food . Stuart decided to change direction to the south west and try and reach the coast near Fowlers Bay . The Aboriginal youth would not continue and went back the way they had already come . He was scared of other Aborigines in the area they were going into . Stuart described the land as being '' ... dreary , dismal , dreadful desert . '' Stuart and Forster reached the coast at Denial Bay in August 1858 , and were back in settled farm lands by 11 September . They had completed a journey of 2,400 kms in four months . He gave his diary and maps to the South Australian government . As a reward , Stuart was given 1000 square miles of land at Chambers Creek .
Stuart was given land at Chambers Creek as a reward for his discoveries . He asked the government for extra land , and to speed up the process he went back to Chambers Creek to survey the area in 1859 . Again he traveled with a small group , three men and 14 horses . After surveying the farm blocks he explored the area to the north west of Chambers Creek .
The South Australian government offered a prize of Â # 2000 to the first person to cross Australia from the south to the north . They hoped this would be a route for the Overland Telegraph that would connect Australia to Europe . Stuart 's plans were not accepted by the government and instead they sent Alexander Tolmer . His expedition did not make it out of the settled areas . In August 1859 Stuart went back to sort out survey problems at Chambers Creek . With William Darton Kekwick and two other men , they took 12 horses and explored the west side of Lake Eyre . He discovered the artesian springs and good grasslands .
There was a lot of support for an expedition to cross Australia . In Melbourne , the biggest exploring expedition in Australian history , the Victorian Exploring Expedition , was being organized for the crossing . This became known as the Burke and Wills expedition , named after its two leaders , Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills . Stuart knew that he would be able to travel further and faster by only going with a small group . In March 1860 , with Kekwick , and new man , Benjamin Head , and 13 horses , Stuart left Chambers Creek and headed north . They were the first Europeans to enter central Australia . They discovered the Finke River , the McDonnell Ranges , and the strange rock formation Stuart called Chambers Pillar . On 23 April Stuart worked out that they were in the very center of Australia . He named a small hill at the spot Mount Sturt , after Charles Sturt . The name was later changed to Central Mount Stuart .
They continued to travel north , beyond the site of the town of Tennant Creek . On 26 June they reached a creek , now called Attack Creek , about 2400 km north of Adelaide . A large group of Aborigines from a group called the Warramunga , attacked the explorers . Stuart decided he could not get any further north . He was running out of food , water was scarce and the horses were in poor condition . The explorers made their way back to Adelaide as Burke and Wills were starting their journey north from Melbourne . Stuart was treated as a hero when he arrived in Adelaide . The Royal Geographical Society in London gave him their Patron 's Medal .
The cost of Stuart 's exploring had been paid for by James Chambers . Because of this , Stuart would not make his journals and maps available to the public . This led to claims that Stuart had not really traveled that far north and that he was lying about his discoveries . In Victoria it was even said that Stuart had not really gone north , but had been hiding in a cellar in Adelaide .
The South Australian government now believed that Stuart would be able to reach the north coast of Australia if he had enough support . They gave Â # 2500 to set up another expedition . On 1 January 1861 , Stuart with a group of 12 men and 49 horses set off from Chambers Creek . The hot weather made it hard to find water . In February Stuart sent back two men with five horses . They reached the northern border of South Australia at about the same time that Burke and Wills reached the Gulf of Carpentaria . He was able to travel 240 km north of Attack Creek , where he found a large waterhole he called Newcastle Waters . From here he looked for a way to go north west to the Victoria River , but he was unable to find water . With the food running out , the men becoming sick , and horses in poor condition , Stuart again decided to return to Adelaide .
Stuart set out on his third attempt to cross Australia on 25 October 1861 . This expedition was called the Great Northern Exploring Expedition . The group was :
McGorrey was a blacksmith who would be able to fix the group 's horse shoes . Waterhouse was a naturalist . They took 78 horses .
They reached Newcastle Waters in three months , and then took a week to rest . Stuart was able to search ahead of the group . He found a series of waterholes , creeks and rivers which meant the whole group were able to reach the north coast . They arrived at Van Diemen 's Gulf on 24 July 1862 . The group then had to travel 3,400 kms back to Adelaide . Stuart was in poor health and became blind . He was unable to ride his horse , and so the other men made a bed with long poles and blankets that could be carried between two horses . Stuart was carried 960 kms by this method . On 17 December 1862 the whole group reached Adelaide . This was also the day that Burke and Wills were buried in Melbourne after the failure of their expedition .
Stuart was in poor health after the sixth trip . He sold his property and decided to return to England in April 1864 . He died in London on 5 June 1866 and was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery . His grave was damaged in World War II , but was repaired in 2010 by the Stuart Society and the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia .

Arithmetic is what we call working with numbers . It is a part of mathematics . The four basic arithmetic operations are addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division .
Harder arithmetic includes working with signed numbers , fractions , and decimals , and taking powers and roots .
Most people learn arithmetic in grade school , but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned . Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic , and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic . A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include carpenters , plumbers , auto mechanics , accountants , architects , doctors , and nurses . Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics , science , and engineering .
A Calculator can be used to do arithmetic .
Serpent is a symmetric key block cipher which was the second finalist in the Advanced Encryption Standard -LRB- AES -RRB- contest after Rijndael . Serpent was designed by Ross Anderson , Eli Biham , and Lars Knudsen .
Serpent has a block size of 128 bits and supports a key size of 128 , 192 or 256 bits . The cipher is a 32-round substitution-permutation network operating on a block of four 32-bit words . Each round applies one of eight 4-bit to 4-bit S-boxes 32 times in parallel . Serpent was designed so that all operations can be executed in parallel , using 32 1-bit slices . This maximizes parallelism , but also allows use of the extensive cryptanalysis work performed on DES .
Serpent was widely viewed as a more traditional approach to security than the other AES finalists choosing a larger security margin : the designers estimated 16 rounds to be sufficient against known types of attack , but specified 32 rounds as insurance against future progress in cryptanalysis .
The Serpent cipher has not been patented . It is completely placed in the public domain and can be freely used by anyone .
The 32 rounds make Serpent more secure than Rijndael ; however , Rijndael with 10 rounds is faster and easier to implement for small Block ciphers and on embedded system . For that reason , Rijndael was selected as the winner in the AES competition .
The XSL attack , if effective and would weaken Serpent -LRB- though not as much as it would weaken Rijndael , which became AES -RRB- . However , many cryptanalysts believe that if implementations considered to overcome the XSL attack , the XSL attack would be more difficult than a brute force attack .

German philosophy refers to philosophy written in German or by German philosophers . It started in the 17th century during the Age of Enlightenment , from Leibniz and Wolff through Kant , Schelling , Fichte , Hegel , Schopenhauer , Marx , Engels , and into the times of Nietzsche and Wittgenstein .
The philosophy that dominated this century was the school of German philosopher and mathematican Gottfred Leibniz , later expanded by his follower , Christian Wolff . Leibniz thought that knowledge comes from reason alone .
On the wake of the Enlightenment , a new philosophy called `` critical philosophy '' developed in Germany . It combined the ideals of philosophers Jean-Jacques Rousseau -LRB- 1712-1778 -RRB- of France and Switzerland and David Hume -LRB- 1711-1776 -RRB- of Scotland , and rationalism and empiricism . The founder of this school was Immanuel Kant . He published three `` critiques '' , the most revolutionary being Critique of Pure Reason -LRB- 1781 -RRB- , the other two being , Critique of Practical Reason and Critique of Judgement . Two followers of Kant , Schelling and Fichte , thought that Kant 's system had some errors and sought to improve it . A third philosopher , Hegel -LRB- 1770-1831 -RRB- , developed his own kind of German idealism . His books are often difficult to read , and his ideas influenced many people , including those who agreed with him , and those who did not .

Wire rope consists of several strands laid -LRB- or ` twisted ' -RRB- together like a helix . Each strand is likewise made of metal wires laid together like a helix . Initially wrought iron wires were used , but today steel is the main material used for wire ropes .
Modern wire rope was invented by the German mining engineer Wilhelm Albert in the years between 1831 and 1834 for use in mining in the Harz Mountains in Clausthal , Lower Saxony , Germany . It was quickly accepted because it proved superior to ropes made of hemp or to metal chains , such as had been used before .
Wilhelm Albert 's first ropes consisted of wires twisted about a hemp rope core , six such strands then being twisted around another hemp rope core in alternating directions for extra stability . Earlier forms of wire rope had been made by covering a bundle of wires with hemp .
In America wire rope was later manufactured by John A. Roebling , forming the basis for his success in suspension bridge building . Roebling introduced a number of innovations in the design , materials and manufacture of wire rope .
Manufacturing a wire rope is similar to making one from natural fibers . The individual wires are first twisted into a strand , then six or so such strands again twisted around a core . This core may consist of steel , but also of natural fibers such as sisal , manila , henequen , jute , or hemp . This is used to cushion off stress forces when bending the rope .
The specification of a wire rope type , including the number of wires per strand , the number of strands , and the lay of the rope , are is documented using a commonly accepted coding system , consisting of a number of abbreviations .
This is easily demonstrated with a simple example . The rope shown in the figure `` Wire rope construction '' is designated :
Each of the sections of the wire rope designation described above is variable . There are therefore a large number of combinations of wire rope that can be specified in this manner . The following abbreviations are commonly used to specify a wire rope .

This article is about the bow used to play musical instruments . For other meanings , see Bow .
In music , a bow is a stick which is strung with hair . It is used to pull across the strings of a string instrument such as a violin , viola , cello or double bass .
The wood used for good quality bows is usually pernambuco wood from Brazil . Some bows nowadays are made from fibreglass . They are often cheaper and still of very good quality . The bow has to be slightly curved so that it straightens out a bit as the hairs are tightened -LRB- this is like the bow of â bow and arrowâ where letting go of the tension of the bent bow makes the arrow fly off -RRB- .
Horsehair is used for the hairs of the bow . These hairs gradually fall out when the bow is used a lot . When a lot of the hairs have fallen out the player can have the bow re-haired . When the bow is new , or when it has just been re-haired , it will not make any sound until the hairs have been well rubbed with rosin -LRB- also called â colophonyâ -RRB- . The rosin makes the hair grip the string as it is drawn across . Every violinist needs to keep a piece of rosin -LRB- called a â cake of rosinâ -RRB- in his or her violin case . They may need to rosin the bow for a short while each time they play . There is a screw at the end of the bow for tightening the hairs . After playing , the bow hairs should be slackened again before the bow is put away . This is to stop the wood from warping -LRB- bending out of shape -RRB- .
The black bit near the heel of the bow -LRB- the end where the player holds it -RRB- is called the frog . This holds the hair in place . The frog may be made of ebony , but sometimes it is made of ivory or tortoiseshell . Near the frog is the grip , which is made of leather or sometimes snakeskin . Expensive bows sometimes have a tip made of silver .
There are other instruments which use bows . In the Renaissance the viols were played with a bow which was held with the palm upwards . Some double bass players still hold the bow in this way -LRB- this is called the German method . The overhand method is called the French method . -RRB-
The kind of bow in use today was developed by the bow-maker FranÃ ois Tourte in 19th century France .
There are other cultures which have bows with only one thick hair .
People who learn to play the violin , viola , violoncello , and double bass spend a very long time learning the technique of bowing . They have to learn to control the bow so that it makes a lovely sound on the string . They learn to control the bow with strong fingers , but never to hold the bow tightly . Sometimes they are asked to pluck the string instead of bowing it . This is called â pizzicatoâ .
The bow is held in the right hand . The left hand makes the different notes by putting the fingers firmly down on the fingerboard .
When string players talk about â putting in the bowingâ they mean : writing in the music for each note whether it is played with an upbow or downbow . A downbow is when the player starts at the heel -LRB- the end that he is holding -RRB- and finishes at the tip . An upbow is when the bow travels in the direction tip to heel . A player does not always have to use â whole bowsâ -LRB- from the heel to the tip -RRB- . In fast music he may only use a small part of the bow . A downbow feels stronger than an upbow , so it is usually used for the first beat of the bar . Downbows and upbows may be used for alternate notes , but often two or more notes are taken in one bow-stroke . This is shown in the music by a slur -LRB- a short curved line like a phrase mark over or under the notes to be slurred -RRB- .
The bow generally should touch the part of the string mid-way between the end of the fingerboard and the bridge -LRB- see the article violin -RRB- . To play quietly the bow should be nearer the fingerboard . To play loudly it should be nearer the bridge .
When the players have been plucking -LRB- pizzicato -RRB- and they need to start bowing again , the word arco is put in the music . This is the Italian word for bow .
Special effects can be made with the bow . These include :
The Chinese yazheng and yaqin , and Korean ajaeng zithers are generally played by `` bowing '' with a rosined stick , which rubs against the strings without any horsehair . The hurdy-gurdy , an instrument known in medieval Europe , has strings which are bowed by a `` rosin wheel , '' which is turned by a handle .

In honor of this , the main ingredient of a ` Wigan kebab ' is the pie , which is placed in a barm cake to make up this popular local delicacy . The combination of pie and mash is traditionally associated with London . Shepherd 's pie -LRB- which does not involve pastry -RRB- is also a favorite amongst people throughout Britain .
In contrast to other meat pies which are served hot , Pork Pies generally have a very high fat content and are always served cold . These meat pies contain beef and gravy in a shortcrust piecase , often with a flaky top . Many bakeries and specialty shops sell gourmet pies for the more discriminating customer .

Fruit pies may be served with a scoop of ice cream , a style known in North America as Ã la mode . Apple pie is a traditional choice , though any pie with sweet fillings may be served Ã la mode . This combination , and possibly the name as well , is thought to have been popularized in the mid-1890s in the United States .

NicolÃ s de Ovando -LRB- Brozas , 1460 -- Seville , 1511 -RRB- was a Spanish soldier from a noble family and a knight of the Order of AlcÃ ntara . He was governor of Hispaniola from 1502 until 1509 . Nicolas de Ovando was born in 1460 in the town of Brozas , in Extremadura , Spain . His family was very religious and , when young , he joined the military religious Order of Alcantara where , in 1478 , he was named Comendador de Lares -LRB- Commander of Lares -RRB- , a very important position in the Order .
As Commander of Lares , he was very appreciated by the Spanish Catholic Kings and , in particular , by Queen Isabella . On 3 September , 1501 -LRB- Oviedo said in 1502 -RRB- , he was named as Governor of Hispaniola and of all lands discovered in America .
On 13 February , 1502 , he went out of the port of SanlÃ car de Barrameda , Spain to go to the Hispaniola island with a fleet of 32 ships . On the fleet , there were 2,500 people , including priests , soldiers and colonists -LRB- some of them with their families -RRB- , who were going to live in the Hispaniola . Among those colonists was BartolomÃ de las Casas , later known as the Protector of the Indians , and also Francisco Pizarro , who conquered the Inca Empire .
The plan of Ovando was to develop the West Indies economically and expand the Spanish influence in the region .
Ovando got in Santo Domingo on 15 April , 1502 .
The administration of Ovando in Hispaniola was one of great cruelty toward the TaÃ no Indians . When the Spaniards came to the island in 1492 , the native population was 400,000 -LRB- estimated -RRB- but in 1508 there were only 60,000 Indians .
Because the new colonists needed more workers for the gold mines and farms , they brought , as slaves , Indians from the Lucayas -LRB- now , the Bahamas -RRB- islands . Then they brought slaves from Spain -LRB- Ladinos , that is , of Africa origin but born in Spain -RRB- ; those were the first African slaves brought to America .
Ovando founded several cities -LRB- or ordered their foundations -RRB- on Hispaniola , among them : Compostela de Azua -LRB- or Azua de Compostela -RRB- , Santa MarÃ a de la Vera Paz , BayajÃ -LRB- today , Fort LibertÃ , in Haiti -RRB- , Salvatierra de la Sabana -LRB- today , Les Cayes , in Haiti -RRB- , SalvaleÃ n de HigÃ 1\/4 ey , CotuÃ , Puerto Plata , Santa Cruz de Hicayagua -LRB- today , Santa Cruz del Seibo , Dominican Republic -RRB- .
Ovando sent AndrÃ s Morales to explore completely the Hispaniola island . Morales made the most complete map of the island . SebastiÃ n de Ocampo was sent to find out if Cuba was an island or part of the continent ; after 8 or 10 months , Ocampo came back with the information that Cuba was an island . In 1508 , Juan Ponce de LeÃ n was sent with 50 men to conquer the island of San Juan -LRB- now the island of Puerto Rico -RRB- .
In 1509 , Ovando went back to Spain where he was made Comendador Mayor -LRB- `` Head Commander '' -RRB- of the Order of Alcantara .

The German-speaking Community of Belgium -LRB- , short DGB -RRB- is one of the three federal communities in Belgium . It is the main part of the so-called East Cantons of Belgium . It has an area of 854 k , and a population of over 73,000 , of which almost 100 % are German speaking -LRB- traditionally Ripuarian-speaking -RRB- .
Its capital is Eupen ; it is part of the province of LiÃ ge and borders on the Netherlands , Germany , and Luxembourg .
The area was known as Eupen-Malmedy , and is now called the East Cantons . It is made up of the German-speaking Community and the municipalities of Malmedy and Waimes -LRB- Weismes -RRB- , which belong to the French-Speaking Community of Belgium .
The East Cantons were part of the Rhine Province of Prussia in Germany until 1920 but were annexed by Belgium following Germany 's defeat in World War I and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles . Thus they also became known as the cantons rÃ dimÃ s , `` redeemed cantons '' . The peace treaty of Versailles demanded the `` questioning '' of the local population about their political status .
This was not a secret vote , and anyone who did not want to become Belgian had to register their full name and address . Many locals feared reprisals or even expulsion after enlisting .
In the mid-1920s the kingdom of Belgium seemed to want to sell the region back to Germany . The French government told the Belgians to stop the Belgian-German talks about the deal .
In 1940 the new cantons were retaken by Germany in World War II . They had only been in Belgium for 20 years , so the majority of people of the east cantons still thought of themselves as German . Following the defeat of Germany in 1945 the cantons were once again taken over by Belgium .
In the early 1960s Belgium was divided into four language areas , the Dutch speaking Flemish area , the French speaking area , the bilingual capital of Brussels , and the German speaking area of the east cantons . In 1973 , three communities and three regions were established and granted internal autonomy . The legislative Parliament of the German-speaking Community , Rat der Deutschsprachigen Gemeinschaft , was set up . Today the German-speaking Community has a degree of self government , especially in language and cultural matters , but it still part of French speaking Wallonia .
Some people want the German-speaking Community to be its own region . One of these is the current Minister-President Karl-Heinz Lambertz .

At the start of the season , six teams needed to pre-qualify : Lola , AGS , EuroBrun , Osella , Coloni and Life .
The first race of the year was held in Phoenix , USA . Unexpected rain in qualifying led to a grid with Gerhard Berger on pole position with Pierluigi Martini second in the Minardi , Andrea de Cesaris third in the Dallara , Jean Alesi fourth in the Tyrrell , Ayrton Senna down in fifth and Nelson Piquet sixth . Alesi took the lead at the start ahead of Berger , de Cesaris , Senna , Martini and Piquet .
Alesi pulled away and Berger was dropping back . Senna passed de Cesaris and Berger hit a wall on lap 9 , forcing him to pit . He charged back but retired with clutch problems . Alesi was 8.2 seconds ahead but Senna started to reel him in . Senna attacked on lap 34 but Alesi defended and kept the lead . Senna did the job properly one lap later and pulled away to win . Behind , Thierry Boutsen passed Piquet to take third with Stefano Modena 's Brabham and Satoru Nakajima 's Tyrrell getting the final points .
In qualifying in Brazil , Senna and Berger were 1-2 with Boutsen and Patrese 3-4 and the Ferraris of Nigel Mansell and Alain Prost behind them . At the start , Senna led Berger , Boutsen , Prost , Patrese and Mansell . Boutsen passed Berger early on but could not keep up with Senna .
At the stops , Boutsen ran into a tyre and had to change his nose cone , dropping back to 11th and some good work from the Ferrari crew got Prost ahead of Berger and Mansell ahead of Patrese . Senna was ahead of Prost , Berger , Mansell , Patrese and Alesi . Senna , 10 seconds ahead hit backmarker Nakajima , forcing him to pit and drop back to third . With just a few laps to go , Patrese retired with a broken oil cooler . Prost duly won from Berger , Senna , Mansell , the recovering Boutsen and Piquet .
An almost identical grid to Brazil saw Senna , Berger , Patrese , Boutsen , Mansell and Prost line up after qualifying . At the start , Senna and Berger got away well but Boutsen sliced ahead of Patrese to take third with Mansell and Prost behind . Boutsen passed Berger on lap 2 . On the next lap , a stone sliced through Senna 's wheelrim , spinning him into a sandtrap and out of the race . Boutsen pulled away from Berger but his engine blew on lap 18 .
Soon Mansell passed Patrese and then attacked Berger . Berger closed the door and Mansell spun without hitting anything nor losing a place . He set off after Berger again but retired with engine problems . At the second stops , Nannini got ahead of Prost . Patrese closed in on Berger and passed him on lap 51 . Patrese pulled away and won from Berger , Nannini , Prost , Piquet and Alesi .
In Monaco , Senna took pole but Prost was second with Alesi third ahead of Patrese , Berger and Boutsen . At the start , Berger collided with Prost , blocking the track and stopping the race . The second was all right and Senna led from Prost , Alesi , Berger , Patrese and Boutsen .
The race settled down and nothing changed until lap 30 when Prost retired with a battery failure . Then Mansell hit the back of Boutsen and was forced to pit and changed his front wing . Patrese 's distributor failed on lap 42 . Behind , Mansell was charging through the field and passed Boutsen to take fourth . But then he was sidelined with the same problem as Prost . At the front , Senna won from Alesi , Berger , Boutsen , Alex Caffi in the Arrows and Ã ric Bernard 's Larrousse .
Canada was next and the McLarens were 1-2 in qualifying with Senna ahead of Berger with Prost third , Nannini fourth , Piquet fifth and Boutsen sixth . The track was damp on race day and Berger jumped the start and then hesitated . He got a 1 minute time penalty as well as allowing Senna to lead on the road . Senna led Nannini , Alesi , Prost , Boutsen and Piquet .
The track began to dry and everyone pitted . But when Nannini rejoined , he hit a groundhog and had to pit again for repairs . He spun off on lap 22 . Berger took the lead on the road but he needed a minute to stay ahead at the end . He charged and was a second quicker than the others as Boutsen spun off while battling Prost . Senna now led from Prost , Piquet , Mansell , Patrese and Derek Warwick .
Piquet after many laps finally passed Prost who was then attacked by Mansell . Patrese retired putting Berger to fifth -LRB- he got ahead of Warwick before -RRB- . Mansell passed Prost and slowly pulled away . With two laps to go , Berger got past Prost on aggregate but could not get ahead of Mansell . Senna won from Piquet , Mansell , Berger , Prost and Warwick .
After Canada came Mexico and Berger qualified on pole position with Patrese beside him and Senna third , Mansell fourth , Boutsen fifth and Alesi sixth . At the start , Patrese and Berger jumped Senna while Piquet got ahead of Boutsen and Mansell . Early on , Senna passed Patrese and Berger followed him through . Patrese was dropping back and Piquet got by him as well . Boutsen was the next to go through but at the same time Berger had a problem with his tyre and was forced to stop and dropped back to 12th . Senna lead from Piquet , Boutsen , Patrese , Mansell and Prost .
Soon , Mansell passed Patrese and got Boutsen four laps later as Prost did the same to Patrese . Prost sneaked ahead of Boutsen as Mansell closed in on Piquet . Mansell got ahead on lap 36 and Prost followed him through six laps later . Piquet soon stopped and dropped behind Nannini , Boutsen -LRB- who already stopped -RRB- and Berger . Berger passed Boutsen on lap 47 and Nannini four laps later . Prost passed Mansell on lap 55 and they began to close in on Senna . Prost , passed Senna followed by Mansell . Then Mansell spun but at the same time Senna got a puncture that let to him retiring in the pits 4 laps before the end and allowing Berger to get third and close in to Mansell . With a daring move Berger passed Mansell but Mansell charged back and attacked taking back second place . Prost won with Mansell second making it a Ferrari 1-2 ahead of Berger , Nannini , Boutsen and Piquet .
France was next , the fans were wearing red and a Ferrari did take pole . However , it was not their hero Prost but Mansell who was ahead of Berger , Senna , Prost , Nannini and Patrese . At the start , Berger got past Mansell while Prost lost out as well . Berger led with Mansell , Senna , Nannini , Patrese and Prost behind . On lap 2 , Senna passed Mansell for second and the order stayed like that until Senna passed Berger whose tyres were destroyed .
Nannini and Piquet pitted early while Berger and Senna went too late . Mansell and Prost 's tyres lasted longer and thus they pitted late . Riccardo Patrese went too late and was the big loser . This left the two Leyton Houses -LRB- they planned the race without a stop -RRB- ahead with a totally shuffled order behind them . Ivan Capelli led MaurÃ cio Gugelmin , Prost , Nannini , Mansell and Senna . Prost then caught and passed Gugelmin who then went out with engine trouble .
As Prost closed in on Capelli , Mansell sneaked past Nannini and started to close in on Capelli and Prost . Capelli defended from Prost on each an every attempt as Mansell went out with engine trouble . Nannini took third but he then had electrical trouble and was forced to retire while Prost passed Capelli with three laps to go . Prost won ahead of Capelli , Senna , Piquet , Berger and Patrese .
Britain was next and Mansell , roared on by his home fans , took pole with Senna second , Berger third , Boutsen fourth , Prost fifth and Alesi sixth . At the start Senna outdragged Mansell while Alesi also got bogged back . Senna led from Mansell , Berger , Boutsen , Prost and Patrese . But Mansell then passed Senna on lap 2 and Senna spun on the next lap , dropping down to fifth .
Soon Prost passed Boutsen for third as Mansell began to have troubles with his gearbox . Berger passed him to lead but then Mansell 's car seemed to improve again . He repassed Berger but Prost was right behind them by now . Soon Prost sneaked by Berger and chased off after Mansell who had gearbox issues again . Prost got ahead of Mansell on lap 44 and pulled away .
However , Berger was unable to catch Mansell as he in turn had handling issues . Behind them Piquet , who had tyre trouble -LRB- he did not stop -RRB- spun , giving fifth to Senna . Mansell then suddenly slowed down on lap 55 as his gearbox troubles became serious , ending hopes of a Ferrari 1-2 . Berger took second but he went out with throttle failure five laps later . In between , Bernard had passed Piquet as well . Prost won again from Boutsen , Senna , Bernard , Piquet and Aguri Suzuki .
Thus , at the halfway stage , Prost led with 41 points with Senna second with 39 , Berger third with 25 , Piquet fourth with 18 , Boutsen fifth with 17 , Alesi and Mansell sharing sixth with 13 with Patrese eighth with 10 . In the constructors , McLaren with 64 points led Ferrari who were second with 54 , Williams who were third with 27 and Benetton who were fourth with 25 .
At the start of second half of the season , there was minor shake-up in pre-qualifying . Lola escaped due to their points , while two Ligiers needed pre-qualifying .
McLaren 's were 1-2 in qualifying , Senna ahead of Berger . Ferrari were 3-4 with Prost ahead of Mansell and Williams were 5-6 to complete the `` Noah 's Ark '' -LRB- two-by-two -RRB- formation , Patrese ahead of Boutsen . At the start , Berger took off better than Senna but Senna just stayed ahead with Berger second , Prost third , Mansell fourth with Patrese fifth and Piquet sixth .
There were no changes until lap 11 when Piquet tried to pass Patrese and went through an escape road , allowing Nannini to get ahead . Three laps later Mansell went through the grass at Ostkurve without losing a place but damaging his car . It proved crucial as he retired two laps later , the damage being too much . Meanwhile , Nannini passed Patrese as the top three stopped for tyres , the Williamses and Benettons planning to go without a stop . Piquet retired with engine trouble .
Thus , Nannini led Senna , Patrese , Piquet , Berger and Prost . Patrese 's tyres were too badly damaged and he was forced to pit . Prost then passed Boutsen for fourth with Patrese following him two laps later . On lap 34 , Senna passed Nannini for the lead and pulled away . Senna won from Nannini , Berger , Prost , Patrese and Boutsen .
Hungary was next and the Williamses qualified ahead of the McLarens , Boutsen taking pole ahead of Patrese , Berger , Senna , Mansell and Alesi . At the start , Boutsen kept the lead but it was Berger went away best and passed Patrese while Senna was worst and lost out to both Mansell and Alesi . Thus , it was Boutsen , Berger , Patrese , Mansell , Alesi and Senna .
It stayed like that on lap 21 when Senna passed Alesi for fifth but he was forced to pit on the next lap with a slow puncture . Nannini soon passed Alesi to take fifth . The leaders stopped and Berger was the big loser with Nannini and Senna the big gainers , rising directly behind the Williams men . The order was : Boutsen , Patrese , Nannini , Senna , Mansell and Berger . Boutsen then pulled away while Patrese held up the others until Nannini streamed by with Senna following him .
Patrese then pitted and dropped behind Piquet as Berger passed Mansell only for Mansell to get back at him . Senna tried to pass Nannini on lap 64 and tipped Nannini into a spin and retirement . Berger tried to do the same thing on Mansell on lap 72 at the same corner with the same result - a collision but with both cars out . Boutsen won ahead of Senna , Piquet , Patrese , Warwick and Bernard .
Monteverdi team had pulled out of F1 , meaning that two Ligiers escaped from pre-qualifying again . In Belgium , McLaren were 1-2 with Senna on pole ahead of Berger , Prost , Boutsen , Mansell and Patrese . At the first start , Piquet pushed Mansell off the road and soon Nakajima and Modena collided as well , resulting in start No. 2 .
Once again , Senna took the lead while Boutsen sliced into second and Prost dropped back to fifth . However , Paolo Barilla smashed into a wall in his Minardi , blocking the track as well as bringing out the red flags .
Start No. 3 was clean and Senna took the lead ahead of Berger , Prost , Boutsen , Patrese and Nannini . On lap 11 , Mansell was into the pits with handling problems . He went out but retired eight laps later as the problems became serious . On lap 14 , Prost sliced ahead of Berger who then pitted for tyres . Senna and Prost , separated by 2 seconds stopped at the same time but then Nannini who was planning to go without stopping came in between them . Then both Patrese and Boutsen went out with gearbox troubles . Prost passed Nannini and Berger tried the same but this time Nannini came back at him to keep the place . On lap 41 , Nannini went wide and Berger sailed through to take third . Senna duly won from Prost , Berger , Nannini , Piquet and Gugelmin .
With five more races to go , Senna now had 63 points , 13 points ahead of Prost with 50 . Berger was third with 33 , Boutsen fourth with 27 , Piquet fifth with 24 , Nannini sixth with 16 , Patrese seventh with 15 with Alesi eighth with 13 . In the constructors , McLaren led with 96 with Ferrari second with 63 , Williams third with 42 and Benetton fourth with 40 .
After Belgium came Italy and Senna took pole again with Prost second , Berger third , Mansell fourth , Alesi fifth and Boutsen sixth . At the start , Berger raced past Prost while Alesi jumped by both the Ferraris . But Warwick crashed at the Parabolica , bringing out the red flags . In the restart , Berger got past Prost and Alesi got by Mansell immediately . Alesi then passed Prost into the second corner and so we had Senna leading Berger , Alesi , Prost , Mansell and Boutsen .
On lap 5 , Alesi spun off and retired . Nothing changed until lap 18 when Boutsen retired with a suspension failure and Berger 's tyres began to fade . Prost then passed Berger and the stops did not change anything . The top three then began to battle for the lead but none was able to close in on the other while Mansell continued to drop back , fighting a faulty throttle return spring . Senna won from Prost , Berger , Mansell , Patrese and Nakajima .
Portugal was next and the Ferraris took 1-2 in qualifying with Mansell ahead of Prost , Senna , Berger , Patrese and Piquet . At the start , Mansell 's snaky start almost took Prost out and the McLarens blasted by them with Piquet getting by Prost as well . The order was : Senna , Berger , Mansell , Piquet , Prost and Boutsen .
On lap 13 , Prost took Piquet for fourth and later Mansell went to the grass , allowing Prost to take third . Mansell and Berger pitted soon as Prost passed Senna at the same time to lead . These two soon pitted as well with a shuffled order : Senna , Mansell , Berger , Prost , Nannini and Piquet . The Ferraris started to close in on the McLarens in front of them by now . Behind them , Piquet passed Nannini to take fifth .
On lap 50 , Mansell was close to Senna and passed him to lead . He pulled away fast but then hit Phillipe Alliot while lapping him , pushing the Ligier into a wall while Mansell got away with no damage . Prost then passed Berger on lap 59 . Two laps later , Suzuki and Caffi collided and with the latter stuck in the cockpit on a zone with the wall next to the track , the race was stopped . Thus Mansell won from Senna , Prost , Berger , Piquet and Nannini .
Now in Spain and Senna took his 50th career pole position ahead of Prost , Mansell , Alesi , Berger and Patrese . At the start , Senna took off into the lead but behind them Patrese hit Alesi , spinning him into the gravel trap and into retirement . Lap 1 and Senna led Prost , Mansell , Berger , Boutsen and Patrese .
Berger was holding up a train of four cras behind him , none of them able to pass on the twisty Jerez circuit . At the stops , Mansell got ahead of Prost but waved Prost through to help his championship hopes just as Senna was coming out of the pits . He split the two Ferraris . The order was Piquet -LRB- he and Nannini were planning to go without stopping -RRB- , Prost , Senna , Mansell , Nannini and Boutsen .
Prost started to attack Piquet who succumbed to the pressure and went wide , dropping down to fourth . Then , Mansell attacked and passed Senna to make it a 1-2 for Ferrari as Piquet retired with battery problems . Senna pitted for tyres but retired when his radiator failed soon after . Three laps later , Berger attacked Boutsen for fourth and two collided , Berger spinning out . Prost won with Mansell making it a Ferrari 1-2 ahead of Nannini , Boutsen , Patrese and Suzuki .
With two races to go , Senna had 78 points to Prost 's 69 and with both having 11 results in the points , it was clear that they would have to drop points . However , Senna would have had to drop two third places unlike Prost who would only have to drop a fourth and a fifth -LRB- if they both finish in the top 3 -RRB- . Berger was third with 40 , Mansell was fourth with 31 , Boutsen was fifth with 30 , Piquet was sixth with 26 , Nannini seventh with 21 and Patrese eighth with 19 . In the constructors , McLaren led with 118 points with Ferrari second with 100 . Williams was third with 49 and Benetton was fourth with 47 .
Before the Japanese Grand Prix , Nannini was involved in a helicopter crash and sustained career-ending injuries -LRB- though he would later return to touring car racing -RRB- . He was replaced by Roberto Moreno for the rest of the season . Moreno had been free since EuroBrun had withdrawn from Formula One , along with Life . As a result , pre-qualifying was not needed .
In qualifying , Senna took pole ahead of Prost , Mansell , Berger , Boutsen and Piquet . However , Senna was unhappy at the side on which the pole was located on as the pole was located on the dirty side of the track and thus the second place being on the racing line which should give the second-placed driver the advantage into the first corner . He went to FISA president Jean Marie Balestre to change the side on which pole was located , but was refused . After this , he decided that he would go for any gap into the first corner if Prost had the advantage . At the start , Prost did have the advantage and Senna went for the gap . Prost did not know it and closed the door . Senna 's left front touched Prost 's rear wing , spinning both of them into the gravel trap . The world championship was sealed .
Although Senna led by 9 points and there were 9 points for a win , if Prost won the last race he would have had to drop his fifth place in Canada which meant that he would be two points behind Senna even if Senna retired . Senna was the new world champion . Back to the race now and Berger was leading Mansell , Piquet , Moreno , Boutsen and Patrese . At the start of the second lap , Berger spun off into retirement after hitting debris from the Senna-Prost collision . This left Mansell who was under pressure by the Benettons leading .
Mansell then began to pull away from Piquet and Moreno as Suzuki passed Warwick for sixth . Mansell pitted with a 15 second lead on lap 27 for tyres but his driveshaft snapped as he went out of his garage . He retired giving the Constructors title to McLaren as they were 18 points ahead and a 1-2 can get only 15 points . The Benettons and Suzuki did not stop but Patrese and Boutsen did with Patrese getting ahead at the stops but both rejoined behind Suzuki . Then Nakajima passed Warwick to take sixth as Warwick then retired with gearbox trouble . Piquet won with Moreno making it a Benetton 1-2 . Suzuki was third , Patrese fourth , Boutsen fifth and Nakajima sixth .
The last race of the year was in Australia and the McLarens took 1-2 in qualifying ahead of the Ferraris , Senna ahead of Berger , Mansell , Prost , Alesi and Patrese . At the start , Senna took off into the lead with Berger defending from the Ferraris and Piquet getting by Alesi and Patrese . The order was : Senna , Berger , Mansell , Prost , Piquet and Alesi .
On lap 2 , Berger missed a gear selection allowing Mansell to get ahead . While defending from Prost , he held up Prost allowing Piquet to get ahead of him . Piquet soon passed Berger for third and the order settled down . Senna and Mansell continued to pull away from the rest , none of them able to keep up . Soon Patrese got past Alesi with Boutsen following suit .
Then , on lap 43 , Mansell went up an escape road , giving Senna a good lead . Mansell was caught and passed by Piquet and pitted for tyres soon after . At the stops , Boutsen got ahead of Patrese . Berger then ran wide entering the Brabham straight , allowing Prost to take third . Mansell passed Berger on lap 57 and soon passed Prost on his new tyres . Senna had a gearbox glitch on lap 62 and went straight on into the wall and retired . Mansell closed in on Piquet , breaking the lap record 3 times towards the finish , taking 2 seconds a lap out of his lead . Piquet made an error with 4 laps to go , allowing Mansell to close right up . Mansell attacked on the last lap with a desperate passing attempt at the end of the straight , was too far behind to make the pass . Thus , Piquet won from Mansell , Prost , Berger , Boutsen and Patrese .
At the end of the season , Senna was world champion with 78 points with Prost second with 71 -LRB- he got 73 but had to drop 2 points -RRB- , Piquet third with 43 -LRB- he got 44 but had to drop 1 point -RRB- , Berger fourth with 43 -LRB- he was behind Piquet because Piquet had more wins -RRB- , Mansell fifth with 37 , Boutsen sixth with 34 , Patrese seventh with 23 and Nannini eighth with 21 . In the constructors , McLaren were champions with 121 points with Ferrari second with 110 , Benetton third with 71 and Williams fourth with 55 .

The Scottish Lowlands is the part of Scotland not referred to as the Highlands .
That is everywhere south and east of the Highland Boundary Fault , between Stonehaven and Helensburgh -LRB- on the Firth of Clyde -RRB- .
Geographically , Scotland Lowlands are divided into two distinct areas : the Central Lowlands , and the Southern Uplands .
The southernmost counties of Scotland , nearest the border with England , are also known as the Borders .
The Central Lowlands or Midland Valley is a geologically defined area of relatively low-lying land in southern Scotland . It consists of a rift valley between the Highland Boundary Fault to the north and the Southern Uplands Fault to the south . The Central Lowlands are one of the three main geographical sub-divisions of Scotland , the other two being the Highlands and Islands which lie to the north and west and the Southern Uplands , which lie south of the second fault line .
The Midland Valley has fertile low-lying agricultural land and significant deposits of valuable coal and iron have led to the Central Lowlands being much more densely populated than the rest of Scotland .

Foster care is a term used to describe when a child is living and looked after by a family which is not their own . The child may be put into foster care because their own parents are not able to look after them . There may be several reasons why this may happen . The parents may be very ill or unable to control their own lives , perhaps because of alcoholism or drug addiction . They may be in prison or the children may be threatened with violence in their own home . They are put into foster care so that they are safe and can live a more normal life in someone else 's home .
When a child is fostered there has to be an inconsequential legal agreement . The person who looks after them instead of their own parents is called a â foster parentâ . The child is made a â wardâ of court , which means that power is given through the court of law to the foster parent to look after them . The foster parent -LRB- s -RRB- is in â loco parentisâ , meaning : â in the place of the parentâ . They can make decisions about the child because the real parent -LRB- s -RRB- are not able to do this .
The laws about fostering children are , of course , not the same in different countries around the world .
In most Western countries fostering can sometimes be a long-term arrangement , perhaps until the child has become an adult . However , in many cases the child may be able to return to their own family later if their family life has changed .
Foster parents are paid by the state to look after the children .
Adoption is different to Foster care . Adopt is to take into one 's family -LRB- a child of other parents -RRB- , especially by a formal legal act .
Fosterage is not the same as Foster care . Some societies have arrangements whereby children are brought up in other families . This is a social matter , not a legal matter . This can be described as `` fosterage '' .

Visibility is a word used in meteorology . It is used to talk about how far a normal person can see depending on the weather . If there is low visibility , such as in a blizzard , a person will not be able to see far . If there is high visibility , such as on a bright , sunny day , a person will be able to see a long way .
Visibility less than 100 m is often called zero . When it is this low , roads may be closed , or lights and signs are turned on to warn drivers . These are put in areas that often have very low visibility . Warning lights help stop accidents . Automobile crashes with many cars happen often in places like this if the warning lights and signs are not put up .
Visibility is said to be good when a person can see farther than about 10 kilometers .
An advisory is put out by meteorologists to warn of low visibility , such as a dense fog advisory from the U.S. National Weather Service . These tell drivers to not travel until the fog leaves . Airport travel sometimes is delayed , or slowed down , by low visibility .
The Australian National University -LRB- ANU -RRB- in Canberra , Australia , is the only university set up by the Federal Government of Australia .

These included physics , medicine , social sciences and Pacific studies . The university started undergraduate courses in 1960 .
A land-grant university is a college or university first built on land the United States government owned . They were made so that more people could go to college , and to do research that helps farmers .
Star Trek is a science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry that aired from September 8 , 1966 to September 2 , 1969 . Though the original series was just called Star Trek , it got the nickname Star Trek : The Original Series -LRB- ST : TOS or TOS -RRB- to make it different from the spinoffs , and from the Star Trek universe or franchise they take up . Set in the 23rd century , the first Star Trek follows the adventures of the starship Enterprise and its crew , led by Captain James T. Kirk -LRB- William Shatner -RRB- , his First Officer Mr. Spock -LRB- Leonard Nimoy -RRB- , and his Chief Medical Officer Leonard McCoy -LRB- DeForest Kelley -RRB- . William Shatner 's voice-over introduction during each episode 's opening credits stated the starship 's purpose :
When Star Trek first came on NBC in 1966 , it was not successful to begin ; ratings were low and advertising revenue was very little . Even at the end of the first season of Star Trek , there were already calls in the network to cancel the series due to its low Nielsen ratings . Bay Area Creature Features host John Stanley in his memoir I Was a TV Horror Host relates how Desilu head Lucille Ball at that time `` single handedly '' kept Star Trek from being removed from the NBC-TV lineup . ''
Close to the end of the second season the show was still in danger of being canceled . Its fans succeeded in giving it a third season ; but NBC moved the show to the Friday Night Death slot at 10 PM . Star Trek was finally canceled at the end of the third season , making 79 episodes in total . However , this was enough for the show to be stripped in syndication , allowing it to become very popular and gather a large cult following during the 1970s . After the success of the program , five additional television series and eleven movies , including the newest film Star Trek , which came out in May 2009 . Guinness World Records lists the original Star Trek as having more spin-offs than any other television show in history .
Valentin Berlinsky -LRB- born Irkutsk , 19 January , 1925 ; died 15 December , 2008 -RRB- was a Russian cellist . He played with the world-famous Borodin Quartet from 1945 when it was founded , and was a member until he retired in 2007 .
Valentin Berlinsky was born in Irkutsk , Siberia . His father had learned the violin with the famous teacher Leopold Auer . He had formed his own string quartet , the Berlinksy Quartet , who had played in many parts of the Soviet Union . Valentin learned the violin from his father . Soon he was sent to Moscow where he studied the cello and played with the Moscow Youth Orchestra . He played in a student concert together with Mstislav Rostropovich in 1938 .
For many years Berlinsky taught the cello at the Gnessin School of Music in Moscow . He did not often perform as soloist . He preferred being a member of a chamber music group .
In 1945 four young players formed a string quartet called the Moscow Conservatoire Quartet . Mstislav Rostropovich was the cellist , Rostislav Dubinsky and Nina Barshai played the violins and Rudolf Barshai played the viola . However , after a couple of weeks Rostropovich found he was too busy , so he suggested that Berlinsky should take his place . The four players that now formed the quartet signed an oath that they would be loyal and stay together as a group . They signed the oath with their own blood . Valentin often showed this piece of paper to people . For 60 years he kept a careful record of all the concerts they played . They called themselves the Borodin Quartet after the composer Alexander Borodin .
The four musicians first met Dmitri Shostakovich in 1946 . They became famous for playing his string quartets . Shostakovich was to compose 15 string quartets . The Borodin Quartet were the most famous string quartet in the Soviet Union , but it was difficult for them to get permission to play in other countries until the fall of the Soviet Union .
Valentin Berlinsky retired from the Borodin Quartet in September 2007 . His place was taken by his pupil , Vladimir Balshin , but Berlinsky still continued to help the quartet .
He died on 15 December 2008 , in Moscow , after a long illness . His daughter Lyudmila is a pianist .
Agny is a commune . It is found in the region Nord-Pas-de-Calais in the Pas-de-Calais department in the north of France .
The parabola -LRB- from the Greek Ï Î Ï Î Î Î Î '' Î -RRB- is a type of regular curve , the intersection of a right circular conical surface and a plane parallel to a generating straight line of that surface . The point on the axis of symmetry that intersects the parabola is called the `` vertex '' . The vertex is the point where the curvature is greatest . Parabolas can open up , down , left , right , or in some other arbitrary direction .
Vishvamitra is the name of a rishi -LRB- sage -RRB- of ancient India . This is a Sanskrit word , and its translation is : universal friend , that is , a friend of everybody . Vishvamitra wrote many verses of the Vedas , especially the Rig Veda and the Atharva Veda .
The Hindu scriptures have many stories about Vishvamitra . One of them tell about the competition between another rishi named Vashistha . Both wanted to become priests of big royal families of ancient India .
DragonForce is an English power metal band formed in 1999 in London . They are known for fast guitar solos , fantasy-based lyrics , and electronic sounds in their music .
In March 2010 , the band have announced the departure of the singer ZP Theart , due to musical disputes .
DragonForce was founded in 1999 by singer ZP Theart , bassist Steve Scott , guitarists Sam Totman and Herman Li , drummer Didier Almouzni , and keyboardist Steve Williams . They first called themselves `` DragonHeart '' , but found that a band with this same name already existed . Their song `` Through the Fire and Flames '' is one of their most famous songs and is featured on the game `` Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock '' The first song and first single , `` Heroes of Our Time '' , from their newest album , Ultra Beatdown , was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance on December 3 , 2008 , and is also in the video game Skate 2 . .
Object-Oriented Design -LRB- OOD -RRB- is a way to for the designer of a computer program to specify what a computer program will do , using the way that people think and not using the way that computers think . People think in terms of classes and objects . For example , a fruit is a class , and there are different kinds of fruits such as bananas and pineapple . If a computer program designer were specifying to a computer programmer how to create a computer program to manage the fruits in a supermarket . He or she would specify the program in terms of classes -LRB- computer science -RRB- and objects -LRB- computer science -RRB- which is how people think .
A computer program called a compiler and \/ or an interpreter would take the program that the programmer typed in and convert it into a form that a computer can run . Computers really only understand things that are encoded as numbers . Object-Oriented-Design -LRB- OOD -RRB- , uses the power and speed of a computer to allow humans to be more productive in making computer programmers , by letting human computer programmers think in terms of how humans think .

Dr. Kurt Schumacher -LRB- born 13 October 1895 in Kulm , West Prussia -LRB- now CheÅ mno in Poland -RRB- - died 20 August 1952 in Bonn -RRB- was a German politician . He was leader of the SPD from 1946 to 1952 and speaker of the SPD in the Bundestag 1949-1952 .
Schumacher was born as the son of a salesman . When World War I started , he left school to join the German army . In December of 1914 , he was badly hurt . His arm had to be removed . After this , he went back to school in Berlin to study Law and politics . While there , he became a socialist . In 1924 , he was elected to the legislature in WÃ 1\/4 rttemberg . He became the SPD leader for WÃ 1\/4 rttemberg in 1928 . In 1930 , he was elected to the national legislature , the Reichstag .
After the Nazis took control of Germany , Schumacher was arrested . He was beaten badly in prison . He was put into concentration camps for the next ten years . In 1943 , Schumacher was set free because of his bad health . He was arrested again in 1944 and stayed in the concentration camps until the British set them free in April 1945 .
After the World War II , Schumacher put the SPD back together . He was first chief of the Social democrats in West Germany after the WWII . He was also their first speaker in the federal parliament -LRB- Bundestag -RRB- and first leader of opposition in the Bundestag .
In 1952 , Schumacher died in Bonn .
Chloroflexi is one of four classes of bacteria produce energy from light and are named for their green pigment , usually found in photosynthetic bodies .
Chloroflexi are typically filamentous , and can move about through bacterial gliding . They are facultatively aerobic , but do not produce oxygen in the process of producing energy from light , or phototrophy . Additionally Chloroflexi have a different method of phototrophy -LRB- photoheterotrophy -RRB- than true photosynthetic bacteria . Phylogenetic analysis indicates that they had a separate origin .
A Formula One race event ia an automobile race using open wheel cars . The race takes place over an entire weekend . There are two practice sessions on Friday . On Saturday , there in one more practice session and then the qualifying session . The race itself takes place on Sunday .
Formula One races are run under the rules and control of the FIA . Typically , a FIA support series , such as the GP2 Series , also runs during the weekend .
All days of the week and times given are local .
The event usually begins on Friday with two practice sessions . The first session , called Practice 1 , runs from 10:00 to 11:30 . The second session , called Practice 2 , rums from 14:00 to 15:30 -LRB- or 2:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. in the 12-hour clock -RRB- .
The practice sessions allow the drivers to learn the circuit and the teams to test their cars . Teams may test new parts on their cars . The car 's wings and suspension settings may be changed to make the car faster . The teams may also allow one of their test drivers to drive the practice session .
The practice sessions have become more important starting in . With the FIA ban on testing during the season , the Friday sessions are the only time a team has to test new car parts .
The last practice session , called Practice 3 , takes place on Saturday from 11:00 to 12:00 . This allows the teams a final tune-up before qualifying starts .
The Monaco Grand Prix has a special schedule . The practice sessions the normally take place on Friday are moved to Thursday . The F1 teams do not have any sessions scheduled on Friday .
The Singapore Grand Prix is the only night race in the Formula One calendar . Because of this , the session times are changed . Practice 1 runs from 18:00 to 19:30 , and practice 2 runs from 21:30 to 23:00 . The practice 3 session runs from 19:00 to 20:00 .
On Saturday at 14:00 -LRB- 22:00 for Singapore -RRB- the qualifying session takes place . This session will determine the running order at the beginning of the race . This is often called setting the grid . The qualifying session is split into three parts , called Q1 , Q1 , and Q3 . Q1 is 20 minutes long , followed by seven minute break . Q2 is 15 minutes long , followed by an eight minute break . Q3 is 10 minutes long . During each part of qualifying , the fastest lap time set by a car is recorded . Drivers may run as many or as few laps as they wish .
After Q1 is complete , the eight slowest cars are eliminated -LRB- removed from -RRB- the qualifying session . This would include any cars that did not set a qualifying time . The remaining 18 car advance -LRB- move on to -RRB- Q2 . The eight cars eliminated are placed in the last eight start positions , based on their fastest time from Q1 . The procedure is repeated for Q2 . The eight slowest cars from Q2 are placed in the 11 through 18 starting positions on the grid .
The top ten cars remain for Q3 . After this final part of qualifying , the top ten starting positions on the grid are set . The fastest qualifier is placed in the first position , which is known as the pole position . This car will have an advantage at the start , because they do not need to follow any other cars .
Generally , a driver will leave the pits and drive around the track back to the start\/finish line . This is called the out-lap , and is not a timed lap . This lap often starts out out at a slower pace to warm up the tyres . They will be up to full speed by the time they reach the start line . When they cross the line , they will try to drive the quickest time they can around the circuit . This is called a flying lap or a hot lap . A driver may run several hot laps in a row . The fastest of these hot laps is used in setting the grid position . Finally , the driver will slow down and drive around the track . They re-enter the pit-lane on this in-lap . If there is still time left , they may put on fresh tyres and try to set a faster hot lap .
In the past , there were more cars entered for each race than the track had available space . When this would happen , not all cars would qualify . The slowest cars would not able to race and would be list as Did not Qualify -LRB- DNQ -RRB- in race results .
In the late 1980s and early 1990s the number of cars attempting to enter each race was as high as 39 . It was too dangerous to have that many cars on the track at the same time . A pre-qualifying session was used . The teams with the worst record over the last six months would need to pre-qualify . This including all new teams . Only the four fastest cars from this session were then allowed to the main qualifying session . The slowest cars from the pre-qualifying session were listed in race results as Did Not Pre-Qualify -LRB- DNPQ -RRB- . Pre-qualifying was ended after when many of the small teams left the sport .
As the number of cars entered fell below 26 , a new problem started . All cars entered would automatically qualify for the race . Some cars were much slower than most of the other cars . The 107 % rule was introduced in . If the qualifying time of a car was not within 107 % of the pole time , the car would not qualify for the race . For example , if the pole time was 1m 30s , the slowest a car could go to qualify would be 1m 36s . The race stewards could allow a slow car to race if they thought there was a good reason for it being slow . For example , rain may have slowed down the qualifying session .
The rule was dropped in when the qualifying format was changed . However , the rule will be return for the F1 season .
The race itself is held on Sunday afternoon -LRB- Sunday night at Singapore -RRB- . Thirty minutes before to race time , the cars take to the track . They may run several warm-up laps if they wish . When they are ready , they line up on the starting grid in the order they qualified . At race time , a green turns on to start the formation lap . The formation lap is a slow lap around the curcuit . The cars warm up the engines and tyres , and all systems are checked . The cars return to their assigned grid spot and stop . The start is called a standing start .
The starting light system is a set of five red lights mounted above the start\/finish line . The red lights turn on one at a time , until all five red lights are on . Then there is a short delay of several seconds . Then the red lights turn off the race starts . The delay is different each time to keep the drivers from guessing when the race will start .
The length of the race is at least 305 kilometers . The fewest laps needed to race at least 305 km is determined for each circuit . The one race that is different is Monaco . There , the race is set at 78 laps for 206.5 km .
The time of the race can not exceed two hours . After two hours , the race is ended the next time the lead car passes the finish line . The race can also be stopped short of the full distance for safety reasons if conditions are bad .
Any time the car needs to be serviced , the driver must make a pit stop . The pit lane is next to the main straight with the start\/finish line . The driver must enter the pit lane using the marked entrance road and slow down . Once they car enters the pit lane , the driver must not drive faster than the pit lane speed limit . If they do , they will receive a penalty . The driver stops the car in the team 's pit box . Each team has one pit box to service both of their cars . After the work is done , the driver reenters the pit lane . At the end of the pit lane , they enter pit exit road . Hear they speed up the car to race speed . The driver may not reenter the race circuit until they leave the exit road .

In music , an arpeggio is a group of notes in a chord which are played one after the other , instead of all at the same time . The arpeggio may either go up or go down , but it is more common going up .
The word arpeggio comes from the Italian word arpeggiare , which means `` to play on a harp '' . This is because harps are very good at playing arpeggiated chords .
An arpeggio is a type of broken chord , but there are many different kinds .
Learning many musical instruments include playing scales and arpeggios . They are often played as part of music examinations , especially for piano and the string instruments . This is because these skills are useful for playing a lot of music . For example , Bach 's Prelude in C is made of many different arpeggios . Guitarists sometimes play arpeggios instead of strumming , and banjo players do it a lot .
An `` arpeggiated chord '' means a chord which is `` spread '' . This means the notes do not start exactly at the same time . This is sometimes called arpeggiato , and in modern music is called a rolled chord . An arpeggiated chord is written with a wiggly line going from top to bottom in front of the chord . An arpeggiated chord is spread from the lowest to the highest note . Occasionally composers such as BÃ la BartÃ k ask for them to be played from top to bottom . This is shown by adding an arrow pointing down .

In 2006 , she had a lead role on HBO 's television series Big Love .
Air France Flight 447 was a scheduled commercial flight from Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , to Paris , France . The aircraft used , was an Airbus A330 jet . 216 passengers and 12 crew members were on board , for a total of 228 people board . On June 1 2009 , the A330 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean , three hours and 30 minutes into the flight , killing all 228 people on board . Wreckage and bodies were recovered from the crash site a few weeks later . However , the real cause of the crash remains a mystery as the plane 's flight data recorder , or black boxes , were never found . A search for the black boxes has now resumed in the beginning of April , 2010 . The search will last for 30 days . Air France Flight 447 is currently the deadliest plane crash Air France 's history and the deadliest plane crash in world aviation history since the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 , which occurred on November 12 , 2001 .
Spectroscopy is the study of light as a function of length of the wave that has been emitted , reflected or shone through a solid , liquid , or gas . Many times it is analyzed when the chemical is heated , because it makes a special color of flame . Most chemicals make a different color or spectrum than other chemicals . This can be used to see what chemicals are in a substance . Spectroscopy allows scientists to investigate and explore things that are too small to be seen through a microscope , such as molecules , and the even smaller subatomic particles like protons , neutrons and electrons .
There are special instruments to measure and analyze these light waves . IR spectroscopy measures light in the infrared electromagnetic spectrum . X-ray crystallography can look at the structure of a molecule . UV-Vis use visible and ultraviolet light to look at how much of a chemical is in a liquid . NMR , Nuclear Magnetic Resonance , can look at nuclei .

A Tesseract is a four-dimensional object , much like a cube is a three-dimensional object . A square has two dimensions . You can make a cube from six squares . A cube has three dimensions . The tesseract is made in the same way , but in four dimensions . The tesseract has eight cells ; each cell is a cube . The tesseract is one of the six convex regular 4-polytypes . Unlike three-dimensional objects which rotate on both an axis and a plane -LRB- the plane being of length and width and the axis being of the leftover dimension , height -RRB- , a tesseract rotates on two planes , one made up of length and width , and one made up of height and the fourth dimension .
Saint-Martin-de-Mailloc is a commune . It is found in the region Basse-Normandie in the Calvados department in the northwest of France .
A tribe is a small group of people who live and work together . A tribe can be a collection of families or may have families and individual people living together .
It is necessary to do work to keep people alive , and a tribe usually divides up the jobs that need to be done amongst themselves .
In today 's world people think of tribes as being from a far distant time in the past when people did not live in cities yet and there were no nations . There are still tribal groups in existence all over the world but their numbers are getting smaller and smaller .
The Bundestag is the legislature of Germany . It meets in Berlin , in the Reichstag building , which was specially rebuilt ready for the Bundestag to move from Bonn .
The Bundestag has at least 598 members . Every 4 years the German people vote .
Each party gets seats , if they got at least 5 % of the votes . Every voter has two votes , one for a person and one for a party . 299 members represent a constituency , just like in the British House of Commons or the US House of Representatives .
The other half are elected from a party list in each Land . The total number of seats a party gets depends on the number of the second `` party votes '' it gets .
But if a party wins more constituency seats than its share of the party votes then it keeps those seats . These extra seats , or extra mandates are the reason the Bundestag sometimes has more than 598 members .
Holography is a method that uses the wave character of light , which depicts an exact description that goes beyond the options of the classic photography .
In contrast to photography , holography not only records the intensity of light , but also its difference of phase . All pieces of information reflected by the object , are recorded .
At holography you basically work with two -LRB- rather three -RRB- waves , the so called reference wave and the exposure wave -LRB- object wave -RRB- . With the reference wave it is possible to save the phase information in the form of a light-dark model on a film . The object wave and reference wave must have the same wave length .
The most famous person linked to the history of holography is the physician Dennis GÃ bor , the inventor of the hologram . In fact his discovery in 1947 , which demonstrated the highlight of a long development , was not supposed to display three-dimensional objects , but to improve the resolving capacity of microscopes .
â cents 1947 Dennis GÃ bor developed the principal of holography â cents 1960 Theodor Maiman invented the Laser -LRB- Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation -RRB- â cents 1963 Emmeth Leith and Juris Upatnieks improved the recording technique â cents 1964 Production of the first hologramm by Leith and Upatnieks -LRB- `` Train and Bird '' -RRB- . â cents 1965 Juri Nikolajewitsch Denisjuk invented the white-light-holography â cents 1967 The first hologram of a person â cents 1968 Stephen A. Benton invented the rainbow-transmission holography â cents 1971 Award of the Nobel Prize of physics to Dennis GÃ bor for the invention of holography
For a hologram you need a laser beam , that gets enlarged by a dispersing lens and goes through a semi penetrable mirror . Only a piece of this laser beam goes through the mirror . Then this beam becomes the reference wave which is recorded on the film . The other piece of the laser beam will be reflected on the mirror and runs as the so called exposure wave at the object . The object reflects this wave on the film .
The process of creating a hologram is nearly identical to photography through diverse chemicals . To look at a hologram just recorded , you have to light the film with the reference wave . These waves are reflected on the film -LRB- hologram -RRB- and create -LRB- within the proper angle of sight -RRB- a virtual picture of the recorded object .
Nowadays industries use holograms more often to measure . In the automotive engineering the autobody is measured by holography techniques for bulges and vibration characteristics . An example of this method is the phase-shift-method . First you take a hologram from the ground level state of the object , then overload the object through heat or mechanical pressure . By covering the original hologram and the modified hologram , interference fringes occur . These interference fringes can be evaluated quantitatively and give information about the deformation . So you can measure tiny terminal expansions or vibrations in mechanical systems . Therefore you need two reference waves that are shifted to each other .
There are holographic storages for analog pictures and digital data . Digital information will be affiliated by a two-dimensional bit-pattern .
A Large format lens is a lens that can be used on a large format camera . These cameras usually cover an area of 4x5 inches or more . The picture taken is then recorded on photographic film , or as a digital image .

Sturgeon is common name are some 26 species of fish in the family Acipenseridae .
These `` living fossils '' of fish evolution once ranged widely throughout the Mississippi River , the Great Lakes and the Hudson River . Occasionally , the lake sturgeon 's dark form can be discerned in reedy shallows or near river mouths . The glimpse is as rare as it is startling .
In the last century , this large was often regarded as a nuisance because it became entangled in and ripped commercial fishing nets . Only later did the sturgeon become prized for its meat , eggs -LRB- caviar -RRB- and oil . A gelatin from the inner lining of its air bladder was used to make isinglass -- a substance used as a clarifying agent in jellies , glues and in the isinglass windows of carriages and early cars .

The blues scale is a hexatonic scale with minor pentatonic scale . But , because blues notes -LRB- or blue notes -RRB- have a different form , there can be no one blues scale . As named in contemporary jazz theory , its use is based on the key and not the chord , unlike some chords in jazz . The semitone differences for a blues scale are 3-2-1-1-3-2 for instance - C-Eb-F-F # - G-Bb-C

Cubism was a very important avant-garde art movement which started in 1906 in France .
Cubism is a style of art which aims to show all of the possible viewpoints of a person or an object all at once . It is called Cubism because the items represented in the artworks look like they are made out of cubes and other geometrical shapes . Cubism was first started by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque . Analytical Cubism is the first type of cubism . Most analytical Cubists painted and drew in monochrome -LRB- only one color -RRB- so that the person who was looking at the painting did not pay attention to color , but only to the shapes and the forms that were being shown .
This was changed in 1912 when Picasso first started painting with colors and using collages . Collage is when you glue together different cut-up pieces of paper to make an artwork . This new form of Cubism was called Synthetic Cubism . Picasso invented collage because he was tired of the way he was making his art , and wanted to try out something new . Pablo Picasso created over 20,000 pictures . From 1912 to 1919 was Picasso 's Synthetic Cubism Period .
Picasso and Braque only showed their artworks in privately-owned galleries . Because of this , they are called the Gallery Cubists .
Soon , there was a group of painters who painted in a Cubist style who showed their artworks in public galleries , which in Paris at the time were called Salons . This group of painters were called the Salon Cubists . These artists were interested in showing , in their artworks , mathematical and philosophical ideas that were new at the time .
Many critics now think that the work of the Gallery Cubists is better than that of the Salon Cubists , but some disagree . However , most people agree that the Gallery Cubists had a bigger influence overall and more impact on the rest of 20th century art than the Salon Cubists .
At the time , very few people knew about the Gallery Cubists because they were so secretive and private , but everyone knew about the Salon Cubists . This is the opposite of how we know about Cubism today : Pablo Picasso the Gallery Cubist is very famous , but far fewer people know about the Salon Cubists . Some of the Salon Cubists include :

The bow is the forward part of the hull of a ship or boat , the point that is most forward when the vessel is underway . The bow is designed to reduce the resistance of the hull cutting through water and should be tall enough to prevent water from easily washing over the top of it .
Lamarckism -LRB- also called Lamarckian evolution -RRB- is a theory of evolution . Evolution tries to explain how species change over time . Today , the most accepted theory of evolution was developed by Charles Darwin .
Lamarckism was developed by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck . He based his ideas , to some extent , on those of Erasmus Darwin , the grandfather of Charles Darwin . Lamarckism says that individuals do not only pass on the things they received from their parents , but also all those things that they learned during their lifetime . As an example , he cited giraffes . Giraffes , which have long necks , must have evolved from ancestors with much shorter necks . His idea was that adults needed to stretch their neck to reach leaves from high branches . Therefore , he thought , the children inherited longer necks . This idea is called the inheritance of acquired characteristics .
Although Darwin did not entirely break with these ideas , his characteristic idea of natural selection relates to the individuals 's relative survival and success in reproduction . Better adapted forms leave , on average , more offspring . This changes the proportion of alleles in the population .
Gregor Mendel discovered some basic rules of heredity . These rules of Mendelian inheritance contradict Lamarck 's theories entirely , but are consistent with natural selection . This explains why Lamarck 's ideas are no longer regarded as a sound explanation of evolution . Where Lamarck and Darwin do agree is that evolution did take place .
The identification of `` Lamarckism '' with the inheritance of acquired characteristics alone is regarded by some as an over-simplification , rehashed in textbooks repeatedly . Stephen Jay Gould wrote that late 19th century evolutionists `` re-read Lamarck , cast aside the guts of it ... and elevated one aspect of the mechanics â `` inheritance of acquired characters â `` to a central focus it never had for Lamarck himself '' . He argued that `` the restriction of Lamarckism to this relatively small and non-distinctive corner of Lamarck 's thought must be labeled as more than a misnomer , and truly a discredit to the memory of a man and his much more comprehensive system '' . Gould advocated defining `` Lamarckism '' more broadly , in line with Lamarck 's overall evolutionary theory .
However , as scientist historians such as Michael Ghiselin and Stephen Jay Gould have pointed out , none of these views were original to Lamarck . On the contrary , Lamarck 's contribution was a systematic theoretical framework for understanding evolution . He saw evolution as comprising two processes ;
In essence , a change in the environment brings about a change in needs -LRB- besoins -RRB- , resulting in a change in behavior , bringing change in organ usage and development , bringing change in form over time â '' and thus the gradual transmutation -LRB- change -RRB- of the species .
The modern point of view is that neither of his two ` forces ' exists ; Lamarck can be credited with the first fully worked-out account of evolution . However , his ideas of how it came about are entirely mistaken .

Tularemia -LRB- also called `` Goblin Fever '' , `` deer-fly fever '' , `` Ohara fever '' and `` Francis disease '' -RRB- is a disease . Usually rodents get it . It is caused by a bacterium , Francisella tularensis . There have been cases where the disease spread to humans . The disease can be treated with antibiotics .
Cases of tularemia should be reported to the local health authority . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention thinkF . tularensis could possibly be a bioweapons agent . For this reason , it has been included in the biological warfare programs of the USA , USSR and Japan at various times . A former Soviet biological weapons scientist , Kenneth Alibek , has said that an outbreak of Tularemia among German soldiers shortly before the siege of Stalingrad was due to intentional release of F. tularensis by Soviet forces , but this claim is rejected by others who have studied the outbreak . In the USA , practical research into using Tularemia as a bioweapon took place at Camp Detrick in the 1950s . It was viewed as an attractive agent because :
By the late 1950s the US biological warfare program was focused mostly on tularemia as a biological agent . The Schu S4 strain was standardized as Agent UL for use in the M143 bursting spherical bomblet . It was a lethal biological with an anticipated fatality rate of 40 to 60 percent . The rate-of-action was around three days , with a duration-of-action of 1 to 3 weeks -LRB- treated -RRB- and 2 to 3 months -LRB- untreated -RRB- with frequent relapses . UL was streptomycin resistant . The aerobiological stability of UL was a major concern , being sensitive to sun light , and losing virulence over time after release .
The United States later changed the military symbol for UL to TT -LRB- wet-type -RRB- and ZZ -LRB- dry-type -RRB- in an effort to retain security on the identity of military biologicals . When the 425 strain was standardized as agent JT -LRB- an incapacitant rather than lethal agent -RRB- , the Schu S4 strain 's symbol was changed again to SR.
No vaccine is available to the general public . The best way to prevent tularemia infection is to wear rubber gloves when handling or skinning rodents or lagomorphs -LRB- as rabbits -RRB- , avoid ingesting uncooked wild game and untreated water sources , and wearing long-sleeved clothes and using an insect repellent to prevent tick bites .
In summer 2000 , an outbreak of tularemia in Martha 's Vineyard resulted in one dead person . It brought the interest of the CDC as a potential investigative ground for aerosolized Francisella tularensis . Over the following summers , Martha 's Vineyard was identified as the only place in the world where documented cases of tularemia resulted from lawn mowing . The research may prove valuable in preventing bioterrorism .
An outbreak of tularemia occurred in Kosovo in 1999-2000 .
In 2004 , three researchers at Boston University Medical Center were accidentally infected with F. tularensis , after apparently failing to follow safety procedures .
In 2005 , small amounts of F. tularensis were detected in the Mall area of Washington , DC the morning after an anti-war demonstration on September 24 , 2005 . Biohazard sensors were triggered at six locations surrounding the Mall . To this date , no cases of tularemia infection have been reported as a result .
In 2007 , a lab of Boston University 's Center for Advanced Biomedical Research , where F. tularensis were being kept for research , was evacuated after smoke set off alarms . An investigation has later determined that an electrical problem was the culprit , and no bacterial contamination was found .
In July 2007 , an outbreak was reported in the Spanish autonomous region of Castile and LeÃ n and traced to the plague of voles infesting the region .

Ralph Vaughan Williams -LRB- b. Down Ampney , Gloucestershire , 12 October 1872 ; d. London , 26 August 1958 -RRB- was the most important English composer of his generation .
Vaughan Williams always pronounced his first name â Rafeâ - -LRB- â Vaughanâ rhymes with â bornâ -RRB- . His father was a rector . Ralph was very young when his father died . The family moved to Dorking near London . He went to Charterhouse School and played the viola in the school orchestra . He studied at the University of Cambridge and at the Royal College of Music where Hubert Parry was his teacher .
Vaughan Williams wanted to be a good composer , so he went abroad to study with famous composers like Max Bruch in Berlin and Maurice Ravel in Paris . Yet he knew that he must not simply imitate these composers , so he also studied English folk song . He became good friends with the composer Gustav Holst . The two men always showed one another the music they were writing so that they could help one another by offering criticism .
In 1910 he wrote a work which became one of his best-known pieces of music : the Fantasia on a theme of Thomas Tallis . The piece is for a string orchestra divided into two sections . It uses a theme by the famous 16th century composer Tallis . He also wrote hymn tunes for the English Hymnal . One of his most popular hymn tunes is the one called Sine Nomine sung to the words â For all the saintsâ . Another lovely work is The Lark Ascending . This is a short work for solo violin and orchestra . The violin sounds like a skylark singing in the sky . In 1934 he wrote a short piece for flute , harp and string orchestra called Fantasia on Greensleeves which is based on the famous English Renaissance tune Greensleeves .
During his long life Vaughan Williams wrote nine symphonies , works for the stage , songs , choral music and chamber music . In 1938 he wrote a famous piece called Serenade to Music for 16 solo singers and orchestra . It was one of several works he wrote inspired by Shakespeare . The words were from the play The Merchant of Venice . It was written for the 50th anniversary of Sir Henry Woodâ s career as a conductor . In 1953 he wrote music for Queen Elizabeth IIâ s coronation , including a very short and simple motet O taste and see which has remained very popular with church choirs .
In his old age he became quite deaf . This was because of the noise of gunfire he had been exposed to when he was serving as a stretcher bearer in World War I.
Some of Vaughan Williamsâ s best works are those where he makes his music sound like folk song . He loved the poetry of Housman and used some of the poems in a song cycle called On Wenlock Edge for tenor , piano and string quartet . His music always sounds English . He was born in the 19th century which was a time when people thought English musicians were not very good . Vaughan Williams and Edward Elgar -LRB- who was a little older -RRB- made people realize that it was possible for an Englishman to write beautiful , moving music .

Tritheism is the belief that there are three distinct , powerful gods , who form a triad . Generally three gods are believed to have separate powers and separate supreme beings or spheres of influence but working together . In this respect tritheism differs from dualism , which typically envisages two opposed Divine powers in conflict with one another .
Ironically , there is no group that claims to believe in or teach tritheism ; the term is solely used as an accusation against others , somewhat similar to the usage of the word cult , in accusing a group of holding an alternate or distorted view of the Christian doctrine of Trinity . The main branches consider tritheism heretical .

In chemistry , paraffin is the common name for the alkane hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n +2 . Paraffin wax refers to the solids with n between 20 and 40 , inclusive .
The simplest paraffin molecule is that of methane , CH4 , a gas at room temperature . Heavier members of the series , such as that of octane , C8H18 , and mineral oil appear as liquids at room temperature . The solid forms of paraffin , called paraffin wax , are from the heaviest molecules from C20H42 to C40H82 . Paraffin wax was identified by Carl Reichenbach in 1830 .
Paraffin , or paraffin hydrocarbon , is also the technical name for an alkane in general , but in most cases it refers specifically to a linear , or normal alkane â '' whereas branched , or isoalkanes are also called isoparaffins . It is distinct from the fuel known in Ireland , Britain and South Africa as paraffin oil or just paraffin , which is called kerosene in most of the U.S. , Australia and New Zealand .
The name is derived from the Latin parum -LRB- = barely -RRB- + affinis with the meaning here of `` lacking affinity '' , or `` lacking reactivity '' . This is because alkanes , being non-polar and lacking in functional groups , are very unreactive .

De Wahl 's rule is a rule of word formation , developed by the linguist Edgar de Wahl and applied in a constructed language Occidental -LRB- known also as `` Interlingue '' -RRB- created by him . It is useful to create certain grammatical forms from others -LRB- for example substantives from verbs -RRB- .
Infinitives of verbs in the language Occidental have usually the ending - ar or - er . The root is obtained in the following manner :
and the verbs formed from them with prefixes .
Because the rule composes from three parts , it is often known as `` three de Wahl 's rules '' .
One creates the substantives and adjectives by removing the endings and thus obtaining the root . After adding - r or - er , one obtains an infinitive in a majority of cases : decora\/t\/ion , decora\/t - , decora\/r .
This rule was applied in the language Occidental . After a possible modification one can apply this rule to create new forms of a word especially in Romance languages or in languages which borrowed vocabulary from Romance languages .

Star Wars : Dark Forces is a first-person shooter computer game which takes place in the Star Wars universe . It was made by Lucasarts . It came out in 1995 for MS-DOS and Apple Macintosh , and a version was later made for Sony Playstation .
The player controls Kyle Katarn , who was once a stormtrooper for the Galactic Empire but left the Empire to become a mercenary . In Dark Forces , Katarn works for the Rebellion which fights against the Empire . The game 's story is about Kyle finding and stopping an Imperial weapons program called the Dark Trooper Project .
Everything in the game is set in the Star Wars universe . Many things in the game are taken from the original Star Wars trilogy movies , such as several weapons and most of the game 's enemies , but some things were made just for Dark Forces .
Many of the planets that the levels take place on were created for Dark Forces , but a few of them are from Star Wars books .
Dark Forces is a first person shooter , so the player controls Katarn and sees from Katarn 's eyes . Much of the gameplay is about fighting and shooting enemies , but there are also many puzzles to solve to move through the missions .
The player can run , strafe , jump , crouch , and move through shallow water . The player can also look up and down . The game can be controlled with keys on the keyboard , and also a mouse can be used to run , turn , and shoot .
The game is made up of separate missions . Each mission has certain goals that the player must finish . The missions are all part of the story . Katarn 's pilot drops him off and picks him up , but he goes through the missions alone without any help .
There are many different weapons in the game that the player can use and that enemies also use . Most of the weapons shoot blaster bolts or other projectiles , but the player can also throw thermal detonators like grenades . Some of the weapons have a secondary fire mode which shoots in a different way .
The story is told in two ways . One way is cutscenes , which are animated videos that play between some missions . Also , before each mission the player is given a briefing which talks about what is happening in the story and what the mission goals are .
In the first mission , Katarn steals the Death Star plans so the Rebels can destroy the Death Star . The rest of the game is a different story .
The Rebels find out about a secret Imperial program called the Dark Trooper Project . The Dark Trooper project is a plot to create new robotic Stormtroopers that are very powerful and dangerous .
Kyle searches for clues about the Dark Trooper Project and sets off to stop it .

Oviraptor is a genus of dinosaurs from what is today Mongolia . Oviraptor was a large-brained dinosaur which cared for its eggs . In 1924 , an Oviraptor fossil was found on top of some eggs , and some thought that it had been eating the eggs . Others thought that the fossilized Oviraptor was probably a parent of the eggs in the nest , and not an egg stealer but a nurturer .
Oviraptor lived in the Upper Cretaceous period , about 75 million years ago . Only one definite specimen is known -LRB- with associated eggs -RRB- , from Mongolia , though a possible second specimen -LRB- also with eggs -RRB- comes from the northeast region of Inner Mongolia , China .
Oviraptor is traditionally depicted with a distinctive crest , similar to that of the cassowary . However , re-examination of several oviraptorids show that this well-known , tall-crested species may actually belong to the genus Citipati , a relative of Oviraptor . It is likely that Oviraptor did have a crest , but its exact size and shape are unknown due to crushing in the skull of the only recognized specimen .
Judging by its relatives , Oviraptor probably had feathers . It had a toothless beak , but its feeding habits are unknown . One specimen has the remains of a lizard in its stomach cavity .
In 1976 , Barsbold referred six additional specimens to the genus Oviraptor , but these were later reclassified in the new genus Conchoraptor . Another specimen , IGN 100\/42 , is perhaps the most famous , owing to its well-preserved complete skull and large size . This specimen was referred to the genus Oviraptor by Barsbold in 1981 and came to represent Oviraptor in most popular depictions and in scientific studies of oviraptorids . However , this specimen , with its distinctive tall , cassowary-like crest , was re-examined by the scientists who described the nesting oviraptorids , and found to resemble them more closely than the original specimens of Oviraptor . For this reason , they removed IGN 100\/42 from the genus Oviraptor , provisionally re-classifying it as a species of Citipati .

William -LRB- `` Bill '' -RRB- W. Gothard -LRB- born November 2 , 1934 -RRB- is an American speaker and writer . At the age of 15 , he gave his life to helping teenagers and their parents live their life in Christian principles . Much of his reputation comes from his efforts to finish that goal . He founded the Institute in Basic Life Principles -LRB- IBLP -RRB- in 1961 . He has also spoken at conferences , and has written many books .
Gothard was born the third of six children to be born to William and Carmen Gothard . His father was the manager of an engineering firm . He later served with several ministries . When Gothard was in the 5th grade , he says that God brought made him know of his need for a personal Savior . Shortly after beginning to believe that Jesus was his savior , he and his family joined a fundamentalist church . Gothard received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Bible from Wheaton College . In 1957 he also got his Master of Arts degree , in Christian Education .
He worked with gangs , church youth groups , high school clubs , youth camps , and families that had problems . He later wrote out seven principles of life he believed were not optional . In 1964 , Gothard was given youth work in the LaGrange Bible Church , in suburban Chicago . Also , Gothard 's Alma mater , Wheaton College , let him design and teach a program based on his work with youth . The course was given the name Basic Youth Conflicts ; two hours of upper-division undergraduate and graduate credit were awarded to students completing the course . Forty-six students , youth pastors , and teachers registered for that first class . The next year over one hundred students joined the class .
Gothard started an organization in 1961 called Campus Teams , which in 1974 changed its name to Institute in Basic Youth Conflicts . Later , in 1989 , the name changed again to Institute in Basic Life Principles -LRB- IBLP -RRB- . Gothard is now the president and a board member of this organization . In the 1970 's they started the Basic Youth Conflicts Seminar -LRB- also called Basic Seminars -RRB- across the United States . More people came , averaging between 10,000 and 20,000 people at each seminar . In the early 1980 â s the seminar attendance began to get smaller . Today seminars keep being held around the world and have an alumni base of more than 2.5 million .
In 1984 , under Gothardâ s leadership , a homeschooling program , the Advanced Training Institute of America was founded . He is the author of many books . In 2004 , Gothard received his Ph. D. in Biblical Studies . Gothard is not married , and has no children .
Gothard 's teaching focuses on seven `` life principles '' , 49 character qualities , and 49 commands that Jesus gave . He views the Bible as the word of God and teaches that while there is only one interpretation of scripture . However , Gothard 's use of the Bible has met with criticism . On his website he states `` the goal of my teaching is to provide Biblical principles and concepts of life to guide people in their choices . ''
Gothard tells people not to listen to `` un-Christian '' music , including all popular and contemporary Christian music . He is in favor homeschooling ; IBLP publishes its own homeschooling material . He has discouraged the use of contraceptives or other family planning .
A monsoon is a seasonal wind which lasts for several months . The word was first used in English for the seasonal rains in the Indian subcontinent . These rains blow in from the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area .
Monsoons also occur in other regions such as in North America , Sub-Saharan Africa , Brazil and East Asia .
The mechanism is simple : land heats up faster than water . The temperature difference between the land and sea can be as much as 20 Â C -- land temperatures in India can be hotter than 45 Â C , while the surrounding water in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea remains in the low 20s . The heat absorbed by the land warms the air above it . The hot air rises , and cooler ocean air rushes inland to replace it . As it moves , it carries moisture with it , releasing it over land as the summer monsoon -LRB- also known as southwest monsoon -RRB- .
The hot air over the land tends to rise , creating an area of low pressure . This creates a steady wind blowing toward the land , bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it . rainfall is increased by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains , as with the Tibetan Plateau , and by surface heating .

Isaac Watts -LRB- 17 July 1674 â `` 25 November 1748 -RRB- was an English pastor , preacher , poet , and hymn writer . He is often called the `` Father of English Hymnody '' : he was the first popular English hymn writer . Because of his short height and large head , in all his portraits Isaac Watts wore a large gown . He wrote about 600 hymns including When I Survey the Wondrous Cross , Am I a Soldier of the Cross , and Joy to the World . He is buried today in BunÂ hill Fields CemÂ etery , LonÂ don , EngÂ land .
Isaac Watts was born in 1674 as a small and sickly child . At this time , his father was in prison for being a nonconformist preacher . At that time in England , a man who did not preach the way the leaders of the Church of England thought about God could go to prison . Christians who were dissenters met secretly in fields and barns to hide from people who would report them . Dissenters were fined for preaching anywhere if five or more people were there . Isaac Watts gave much encouragement for people to continue to believe in Christ .
Isaac , even when he was young , was good at and liked rhyming . He was a good student and liked books . Once , when his mother said she would give a farthing -LRB- a coin -RRB- to one of her husband 's students who could make the best rhyme , Isaac tried and made this couplet :
`` I write not this for a farthing , but to try How I your farthing writers can outvieâ . ''
When he was six , he made some verses . When his mother saw them , she could hardly believe he had written them . So Isaac gave his mother a poem he had made with his name :
I am a vile polluted lump of earth S-o I 've continu 'd ever since my birth A-lthough Jehovah grace does daily give me A-ssure this monster Satan will deceive me C-ome , therefore , Lord , from Satan 's claws relieve me .
W-ash me in thy blood , O Christ A-nd grace divine impart T-hen search and try the corners of my heart T-hat I in all things may be fit to do S-ervice to thee , and sing thy praises too .
When he was in his early tewnties , Isaac saw a need in the church . He told his father that the psalms sung in the church were rough and hard . Isaac 's father challenged him to write better songs , and Isaac began writing hymns . Watts produced many hymns for which he is now famous .
Watts also saw that children needed to have hymns that suited their age , hymns that they could sing in their everyday life . Because of this , in 1720 he wrote Divine and Moral Songs , for the Use of Children . These songs were about problems of youth at that time and still today , with titles like Against Evil Company and Against Pride in Clothes .
Watts lived a long and full life preaching about Jesus , teaching , and writing books and hymns . When he died , his papers were given to Yale University .

Twins are two animal -LRB- including human -RRB- offspring that are born from the same pregnancy .
Human twins are two people that shared the uterus during a single pregnancy , and one is normally born quickly after the first . Because of the size of the uterus , multiple pregnancies are less likely to last the full 38 weeks than most single birth pregnancies . On average , they last 35 weeks . This also means about 50 % of twins is born prematurely .
Fraternal twins , also known as `` non-identical twins '' or dizygotic twins : Two separate ova are fertilized , which each becomes a zygote . The two zygotes grow into two genetically different beings .
Identical twins or monozygotic twins : A single ovum is fertilized to form one zygote . This zygote later splits , and each half of the zygote becomes a twin . The twins have the same genes . Semi-identical twins : A single ovum is fertilized by two sperm cells , and splits . The twins have the same genes from their mother 's side , but each twin has different genes from their father 's side .
There are five variations of twinning that occur commonly in the world . The three most common variations are all fraternal , meaning the two twins are not from the same egg : -LRB- 1 -RRB- male-female twins are the most common result , at about 40 % of all twins born ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- female fraternal twins -LRB- sometimes called sororal twins -RRB- , about 20 % ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- male fraternal twins , about 20 % . The last two variations are identical twins , which means they come from one single egg that split later : -LRB- 4 -RRB- female identical twins -LRB- about 10 % -RRB- and -LRB- 5 -RRB- -LRB- least common -RRB- male identical twins -LRB- about 10 % -RRB- .
Twinning is common in many other animals , such as cats , sheep , and ferrets . Twinning occurs in cattle about 1-4 % of the time , and research is underway to improve the odds of twinning , which can be more profitable for the breeder if complications can be sidestepped or managed .
Dysart is a town on the south-east coast of Scotland , between Kirkcaldy and West Wemyss in Fife . A former royal burgh , Dysart is now a suburb of Kirkcaldy . Dysart was once part of a large estate owned by the St Clair or Sinclair family . They were given burgh of barony status for the town at the end of the 15th century .

In the 16th and 17th centuries , they began to trade with the Baltic Countries . Dysart got two nicknames : `` Salt Burgh '' and `` Little Holland '' .
When the coal mine , the Lady Blanche Pit , closed suddenly use of the harbor almost stopped . The town was joined with the royal burgh of Kirkcaldy in 1930 . Large parts of the historic town were pulled down in the 1950 's and 1960 's for new housing . People living in the town were able to protect some areas , most notably the 16th century and the 18th century houses of Pan Ha ' opposite the harbor . These have been repaired and preserved for future generations . Today , Dysart retains an individual character within the boundary borders of neighbouring Kirkcaldy .

Cigars are made of different types of tobacco which are cured in many different way to produce unique flavors and fragrances . Most quality cigars are rolled using a tobacco leaf , though more and more cigars have been rolled using different types of paper to replace the tobacco leaf .

Hand rolled cigars prove to still be the best option , but are more costly . Cuba is known world wide for their cigars . Many other countries also produce cigars , most notably in the central America and Caribbean island areas .
`` Avalon '' is a popular song . It was written by Al Jolson , Buddy DeSylva and Vincent Rose in 1920 . It was first recorded by Jolson and used in the musicals Sinbad and Bombo . Jolson 's version became # 2 on the American singles chart . It is possible that Rose wrote the song alone , and that Jolson 's name was used in the credits because he was a popular artist and helped make the song popular . At first only Rose and Jolson were marked as the writers , and DeSylva 's name was added later .
Many jazz artists have recorded the song , for example Cab Calloway -LRB- 1934 -RRB- , Coleman Hawkins -LRB- 1935 -RRB- and Eddie Durham -LRB- 1936 -RRB- . Benny Goodman played the song in his concert in Carnegie Hall in 1938 . The song was also played in the films The Jolson Story -LRB- 1946 -RRB- and The Benny Goodman Story -LRB- 1956 -RRB- .
The melody at the beginning of the song was taken from Giacomo Puccini 's opera Tosca , and Rose changed it only a little . Because of this , a court later decided that Jolson and Rose had to pay Puccini 's publishers $ 25,000 and all later profits from the song .

Child pornography is material showing children in erotic poses or having sex . It is usually graphic material in the form of drawings , photographs or video , but can be in writing as well . Child pornography that involves real children is a record of child sexual abuse .
Usually , these children are shown or described as being in different stages of undress , with some clothes off , or completely naked .
Child sexual abuse happens in different ways in the making of child pornography , with the most critical way being the actual molestation . Another way is that , when the act is captured with a camera it makes the abuse worse for the child , just knowing that the event is being recorded for possible future abuse - including extortion -LRB- black-mailing -RRB- and sharing , out of the victims control . Linked to that is many of the reasons to why that recording is then - in itself - seen as abuse ; One important part of those reasons , is that the recording makes the abuse possible to go on even longer than the direct damage upon the child , and with the Internet it may very well be seen as permanent . This makes the impact on the child even larger , not knowing - but surely worrying of - how the images might be used .
In both common usage and for the purpose of research -LRB- looking up information -RRB- , the word `` child '' in the phrase `` child pornography '' refers to children before they reach puberty , and does not refer to post-puberty teenagers . For practical reasons , the way the law describes child pornography generally refer to a wider age range , including any pornography involving a minor , according to where the law applies . Most people who own child pornography who are arrested are found to own images of children who have not started puberty ; owners of pornographic images of post-puberty minors are less likely to be prosecuted , even though those images also fall within the laws .
Child pornography is a multi-billion dollar industry and among the fastest growing crime activities on the Internet , according to the USA The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children -LRB- NCMEC -RRB- , the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children -LRB- ICMEC -RRB- and other international sources . According to the NCMEC , almost one fifth of all Internet pornography is child pornography . New technology such as inexpensive digital cameras and sending across the internet , such as File sharing , has made it easier than ever before to produce and pass out child pornography . The people who make child pornography try to avoid prosecution by sending their material across borders with other countries , though this issue is being dealt with more and more with regular arrests of suspects from a number of countries happening over the last few years .
Child pornography is looked at and collected by pedophiles for a number of purposes , ranging from private sexual uses , exchanging with other pedophiles , preparing children for sexual abuse as part of the process known as `` grooming '' , or for bribing victims into making more child pornography or going into child prostitution .

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe 's Faust is the most famous play in all German literature . It was published in two parts . Part One is very dramatic , and tells the main story . Part II is extremely long , and it is meant to be read rather than acted out on stage . It is about Goetheâ s philosophy as well as about history and politics .
` Goetheâ s Faust is a re-telling of the Faust legend which was very famous in Germany . The legend tells of a man called Faust who is tired of studying and wants to have the greatest possible happiness . The devil -LRB- usually called Mephistopheles , as he is in Goetheâ s play -RRB- tells Faust he can help him to do this , but that in the end Faust will have to give him his soul and go with him to hell . Faust makes a pact -LRB- an agreement -RRB- with Mephistopheles who promises him all his soul can wish for : fine living , gold , women and honor . Faust signs the pact with his blood . Faust uses magic in the hope that it will tell him everything about life . However , in the end Mephistopheles wins his bet .
The subject of Faust occupied Goethe all his life . The name of Faust is mentioned in a comedy he wrote in 1769 : â Die Mitschuldigenâ . In 1773 , when he was 24 , he first read the poetry of Hans Sachs , the medieval German poet . He immediately started to imitate the rhythm of Sachsâ s poetry . This rhythm is known as â KnÃ 1\/4 ttelversâ . It had 4 accented syllables in each line and an AABB or ABAB rhyming pattern , e.g.
In 1887 , long after Goetheâ s death , it was discovered that he had made a version of â Faustâ which he never published but later decided to rewrite . This version is known as the â Urfaustâ -LRB- â Urâ means â originalâ , i.e. the â Original Faustâ -RRB- . It was written between 1772 and 1775 . He changed a lot of it and it became â Faust Part Iâ . A fragment -LRB- small part of it -RRB- was published in 1790 . Then he finished it in 1806 , published it in 1808 and changed it for a new edition in 1829 . Part 2 was finished in 1831 , a few months before he died , and was not published until a few months after his death .
Faust Part One starts off in heaven . Mephistopheles makes a bet with God : he says that he can go down to earth and meet Faust and make him do bad things .
We then see Faust in his study . Faust is trying to get to know all possible things . He wants to know about science , humans and religion . He tries to use magic in order to understand everything there is to know , but he thinks he is not managing to do it . For a moment he thinks of killing himself , but then hears people celebrating Easter and decides to go for a walk with Wagner , his assistant . A poodle who has no home follows Faust back to his house .
In Faustâ s study , the poodle changes into the devil -LRB- Mephistopheles -RRB- . Faust makes an arrangement with the devil : the devil will do everything that Faust wants while he is here on earth , In exchange Faust will serve the devil in hell . Faust 's arrangement is that if during the time while Mephistopheles is serving Faust , Faust is so pleased with anything the devil gives him that he wants to stay in that moment forever , he will die that very moment -LRB- in German he says : â Verweile doch , du bist so schÃ nâ â `` â Stay a while , you are so beautifulâ . It is perhaps the most famous quotation in all German literature . -RRB-
Mephistopheles persuades Faust to sign the agreement with his own blood . Faust has a few adventures and then meets Margaret -LRB- also known as Gretchen -RRB- . He loves her , and by offering her jewellery , and with help of a neighbor , Martha , Gretchen lets herself into Faust 's arms . Faust and Gretchen want to sleep together , so Gretchen gives her mother a sleeping potion so that she does not see Faust . Faust and Gretchen sleep together . Gretchenâ s mother dies of the potion . Gretchen discovers she is pregnant . Gretchenâ s brother says Faust is bad and challenges him , but Faust kills him -LRB- with the devilâ s help , of course -RRB- . Gretchen has given birth to a baby , but she drowns it . She is found guilty of murder and is sent to prison . Faust tries to save her from death , but he can not free her from prison . Finding that they can not free her , Faust and the devil run away from the prison cell , while voices from heaven say that Gretchen shall be saved .
Faust Part Two is very different from Part One . It keeps referring to classical literature . The romantic story of the first Faust is forgotten , and Faust wakes in a field of fairies . He has many adventures . The piece is in five acts which each tell of different things . In the end Faust goes to heaven , because he loses only half the bet . Angels , who arrive as messengers of Godâ s mercy , say at the end of Act 5 : `` He who strives on and lives to strive \/ Can earn redemption still '' -LRB- i.e. anyone who tries hard in life can still be saved -RRB- .
Goetheâ s `` Faust '' had an enormous influence on all art in Western countries . In Germany many writers were fascinated by the legend . They often felt that Faust represented the spirit of the German people . Dramas , epic poems and novels were written about Faust . Composers wrote operas about him . Thomas Mann wrote a novel `` Dr Faustus '' which compares Faustâ s pact with the devil to the way the German people supported Hitler . Composers wrote operas about him , or composed orchestral music inspired by the legend .

â Candiru -LRB- candirÃ -LRB- Spanish , also known as canero or toothpick fish -RRB- are parasitic freshwater catfish and a member of the Trichomycteridae family . They can be found in the Amazon River and to the people who live there , they are the most feared fish in its waters , even over the piranha . They are eel-shaped and translucent , making them very difficult to see in the water . Some species have been known to grow to a size of 6 inches -LRB- ~ 15 cm -RRB- in length .
The area that has the most of these fish is at the section between the Amazon River and the Rio Negro , near Brazil 's inland city of Manaus .
Candiru are parasites . Their ability to detect respiratory currents in the water allows them to swim into the gill openings of other aquatic species , where they feed on their prey 's blood .
While the members of the subfamily Vandelliinae feed on blood , members of Stegophilinae may feed on scales , mucus , or carrion .
To hunt for its prey , the CandirÃ lies at the bottom of the river testing and sniffing the water for certain chemicals , such as urea and ammonia from the gills of other fish . Once they have found a fish nearby they rush with a burst of speed to the gill cavity and attaches itself with its spines . Then , it begins to gnaw a hole towards a major blood vessel and stuffs itself for no more than a few minutes , which usually causes the victim to die . It will then release itself and sink back to the river bed in order to digest its food and wait for its next meal .
This fish is also known to attack humans and animals and swim into an open body part like the vagina , anus , or even the penis , going deep into the urethra .
The fish finds human targets when people urinate near the fish .

Screaming Life is the debut EP by the Seattle grunge band Soundgarden , released in October 1987 on Sub Pop Records . Screaming Life was later combined with the band 's next EP , Fopp -LRB- 1988 -RRB- and released as Screaming Life\/Fopp in 1990 .
The EP was recorded in 1987 in Seattle 's Reciprocal Studios with producer Jack Endino , who also produced albums for Nirvana and Mudhoney .
Drummer Matt Cameron described the sound on the EP as `` pretty raw . '' `` Hunted Down '' , Soundgarden 's first single , is representative of the early `` grunge '' sound â '' with its dirty guitar , dissonant atmosphere and lyrics concerning entrapment and escape . `` Nothing to Say '' features drop D tuning , which would become a signature of Soundgarden 's sound on later albums . Guitarist Kim Thayil said he learned about the tuning from the Melvins 's Buzz Osborne . The original version of `` Tears to Forget '' appeared on the 1985 Deep Six compilation album , which featured some of the first recordings by the earliest Seattle grunge bands , including Soundgarden . That version was recorded with drummer Scott Sundquist , but the version on Screaming Life was recorded with Cameron .
Some time prior to recording , producer Jack Endino found old rolls of quarter-inch tape at a garage sale , and some contained recordings of a Christian preacher giving sermons in the early 1950s . Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell had the idea to have the preacher 's voice on `` Hand of God '' . The recording was synched with the eight-track machine , copied to an empty track and by coincidence -LRB- or because , as Endino says , `` God smiled upon us '' -RRB- the tape rolls matched perfectly with the song . Cornell also added his own sarcastic preacher-style vocals , with the lines `` let it be known today that if you 've got two hands you 're supposed to pray ! '' . However , according to Endino , the labels on the rolls of tape were near-illegible and thus the name of the preacher remains unknown .
Cornell said that the EP was met with rave reviews and that `` everybody loved it . '' `` Hunted Down '' was Soundgarden 's first single and also the first song on Sub Pop 's `` hold music '' tape . According to Thayil , `` you would call them up , and when they put you on hold you heard ` Hunted Down ' '' . It was the only single released from the EP . `` Nothing to Say '' was Soundgarden 's first B-side , released on the `` Hunted Down '' single . The song also appeared on the KCMU compilation tape Bands That Will Make Money , which was distributed to record companies . Upon hearing the song , record labels began contacting the band , which eventually led to the band signing with A&M Records .
The cover of Screaming Life was taken by grunge photographer Charles Peterson , and features Cornell singing and Thayil playing guitar in the background . The album cover was an attempt by Sub Pop to capitalize on Cornell 's image . The first 500 copies of the EP were pressed on orange vinyl ; after that , they were released on standard black vinyl .
The title of the EP inspired the title of a book of photography by Peterson , named Screaming Life : A Chronicle of the Seattle Music Scene . Published in 1995 , it is composed mainly of live photos taken by Peterson from the mid 1980s though the mid 1990s . Many of Peterson 's photographs were used as album artwork for grunge bands . The book is accompanied by a CD , with 9 songs selected by Peterson from bands of the era â `` Soundgarden 's `` Entering '' is one of these songs .

The Simputer is a small , cheap device , similar to personal digital assistant -LRB- palmtop -RRB- . The unique feature of this device is a smart-card interface which allows a single Simputer to be used by many users . User 's private datas might be kept on a cheap smart-card . This device was constructed by Indian company - Simputer Trust . The name stands for `` Simple computer '' .
The Simputer project was invented during the organization of the Global Village , an International Seminar on Information Technology for Developing Countries . It was conducted in October 1998 . The discussion was about big need for a low-cost mass access device which will bring local-language IT to the masses . During inventing a name for new established original device , the purpose was to find complex acronym to fit the name Simputer . Thus Simputer is a Simple , Inexpensive , Multi-lingual comPUTER . Later it was expanded to Simple , Inexpensive Multi-lingual People 's compUTER . Now it is also called `` computer for the masses '' .
It is architecturally similar to the Linux Advanced Radio Terminal and the Intel StrongARM reference platform . It has processor Intel StrongARM 200 + MHz , 64MB of RAM , 32MB Flash ROM and may use cheap smart-cards with capacity 8KB .

The crankshaft , sometimes casually called the crank , is the part of an engine which changes the up and down motion of the pistons into rotation . To convert the motion , the crankshaft has one or more offset shafts . The pistons are connected to the crankshaft by these shafts . When the piston moves up and down , it pushes the offset shaft . This in turn rotates the crankshaft .
The pistons cause a pulsing affect in the rotation . A crankshaft usually connects to a flywheel . The flywheel smooths out the rotation . Sometimes there is a torsion or vibration damper on the other end of the crankshaft . This helps reduce vibrations of the crankshaft .
Large engines usually have several cylinders . This helps to reduce pulsations from individual firing strokes . For some engines it is necessary to provide counterweights . The counterweight is used to offset the piston and improve balance . While counterweights add a lot of weight to the crankshaft , it provides a smoother running engine . This allows higher RPMs to be reached and more power produced .

Sir Richard Owen KCB -LRB- Lancaster , 20 July 1804 -- 18 December 1892 -RRB- was an English biologist , comparative anatomist and palaeontologist .
Owen is probably best remembered today for coining the word Dinosauria -LRB- meaning ` Terrible Reptile ' -RRB- , and for his outspoken opposition to Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection .
Owen was the driving force behind the establishment , in 1881 , of the British Museum -LRB- Natural History -RRB- in London .
Owen 's technical descriptions of vertebrates were important . His Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Vertebrates -LRB- 3 vols . London 1866 â `` 1868 -RRB- was a standard reference work for many years .
His career was tainted by accusations that he failed to give credit to the work of others and even tried to appropriate it under his own name .
`` Owen : the most distinguished vertebrate zoologist and palaeontologist ... but a most deceitful and odious man . '' Richard Broke Freeman -LRB- Charles Darwin : a Companion . Dawson 1978 -RRB-
Owen credited himself and Georges Cuvier with the discovery of the Iguanodon , completely excluding any credit for the original discoverer of the dinosaur , Gideon Mantell . This was not the first or last time Owen would deliberately claim a discovery as his own , when in fact it was not . Owen was finally dismissed from the Royal Society 's Zoological Council for plagiarism .
Owen was highly critical of Darwin 's On the Origin of Species , in part because Darwin did not refer much to the previous scientific theories of evolution . Instead , Darwin compared the theory of evolution by natural selection with the unscientific theory in the Bible .
Owen , in Darwin 's opinion , was `` Spiteful , extremely malignant , clever ; the Londoners say he is mad with envy because my book is so talked about '' . `` It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me '' .
`` At the root was Owenâ s feeling that Kew should be subordinate to the British Museum -LRB- and to Owen -RRB- and should not be allowed to develop as an independent scientific institution with the advantage of a great botanic garden . ''
In the first part of his career Owen was regarded rightly as one of the great scientific figures of the age . In the second part of his career his reputation slipped . This was not solely due to his underhanded dealings with colleagues ; it was also due to the serious errors of scientific judgement which were discovered and publicized . A fine example was his decision to classify man in a separate sub-class of the Mammalia -LRB- see Thomas Henry Huxley -RRB- . In this Owen had no supporters at all . Also , his unwillingness to come off the fence concerning evolution became increasingly damaging to his reputation as time went on .
Owen continued working after his official retirement at the age of 79 , but he never recovered the good opinions he had got in his younger days .

The Hiram College Library has provided a welcoming , comfortable , and intellectually stimulating environment for many generations of students , faculty , staff , and community members . But it hasnâ t always been the same place , or even in the same place , through its history . The Library has grown , added and subtracted parts , nearly been destroyed , and moved from one end of the campus to the other in its 100 + year career .
Prior to 1900 , library facilities at Hiram College consisted of the small libraries of each of the student literary societies : Delphic , Hesperian , and Olive Branch . Societies usually limited access to their members , and the only common library was the collegeâ s depository collection of federal government publications -LRB- established in 1874 -RRB- that was stored in the original Hinsdale Hall .
The Teachout-Cooley Library of Hiram College was erected in 1900 with money given by Abram Teachout . Built of brick and wood , it had two stories with a three story tower . In 1923 , a supplemental gift from the Teachout family made possible an addition built to the south of the original building , and joined to it by means of a vestibule . A Greek portico entrance was added , and the size of the Library was essentially doubled . An observatory with its telescope , a gift of Lathrop Cooley , was a prominent feature of the building until 1939 . The observatory was relocated to its present site on Wakefield Road thanks to the generosity of Ella M. Stephens .
The Libraryâ s collections then consisted of those books donated by the literary societies and the depository collection . These were consolidated by the first Librarian of the college , Emma Ryder . While a student at Hiram , she was made the librarian of the Olive Branch Society , and did such an excellent job that she was asked to organized the libraries of the other societies . After she graduated in 1890 , she went on to study at the University of Chicago and Syracuse University , before returning to Hiram in 1896 . She served as the collegeâ s Librarian until 1907 , and introduced the Dewey Decimal System to the Library . She also taught Greek and Latin , was the College Registrar and the House Mother for Miller Hall .
The old building was largely destroyed by fire in February of 1939 . In addition to thousands of books , also lost were a major portion of the files and records of Professor John S. Kenyon and the furnishings of the Vachel Lindsay Reading Room . Kenyon , a linguist , was a prominent scholar of English pronunciation and regional dialects .
But , like a phoenix , the Library rose again , and a newer , more modern building was erected with a main reading room on the lower floor and a browsing room above . The card catalog was saved from fire damage and much of the lost book collection was replaced . The west end of the browsing room was designated the Vachel Lindsay Room , and the east end as the Adelaide Robbins Rhodes Room . In 1962 this area was converted into the Geidlinger Music Room through a gift from Ms. Ella Geidlinger and Mrs. Ruth G. Sheets in memory of their sister , Charlotte Geidlinger .
In 1948 a further addition to the south side of the Library was built , again with funds from the Teachout Foundation . Finally , a fourth addition was necessary by 1963 . This expanded the building westward toward Dean Street and effectively doubled the size of the Library once again . Included were rooms for the newly planned Archives and Special Collections . It was made possible by a substantial gift from Mr. and Mrs. Harley C. Price , and the Library was renamed the Teachout-Price Memorial Library .
During the 1970s the Library came to share space with newer services , the Media Center and the Dray Computer Center , both on the lower level of the building . The Media Center became administratively incorporated into the Library . By the late 1980s the continued growth of the collection , the demand for more study space , and the need to incorporate new technologies led to the decision to plan for a new building . A comprehensive capital campaign by the college featured the construction of a $ 7.1 million facility as its centerpiece . Funding came from hundreds of contributors and friends , prominently the Kresge Foundation , however no single donor contributed enough to confer a name to the building , and so it remains the Hiram College Library . Completed in 1995 , the collections , equipment , and some of the furnishings of the Library were relocated in the new building that summer . Features of the new building included space for a video studio , a redesigned Archives and Special Collections , a Library Instruction Room , group study rooms , and a multi-functional space , the Pritchard Room .
Shortly thereafter , the Library provided access to its new online catalog , and two years later joined the OhioLINK Consortium , thereby expanding the options of our students , faculty , and staff far beyond the walls of the new building . Since then , change has been a nearly continuous process with modifications and improvements to the collections , services , and spaces of the Library becoming a yearly , monthly , and weekly affair . Among the more prominent changes since 1995 include : â cents The movement of the music collections out of the Chamberlain Room , and its replacement by the Childrenâ s Literature and Curriculum Materials Collections . â cents Redesignation of the Media Center as the Center for Educational Technology -LRB- CET -RRB- and its reorganization of the CET under the auspices of the Computer Center â cents Wholesale movement of collections to make room for a new reading area and music recording collections .
At this point in the Libraryâ s history it seems safe to say that the previous paragraph will undergo regular modification as we undergo self-assessment to offer the best collections , services , and facilities possible .

Some think the first people in Finland already spoke a language that is related to Finnish that is spoken today . It is known for sure that an early form of the Finnish language was spoken in Finland in the Iron Age . -LRB- The Iron Age was in Finland 2500-800 years ago -RRB- .
The first residents in Finland hunted animals , instead of farming their food . Those kind of people are called `` hunter-gatherers '' .

Adelheid Emma Wilhelmina Theresia -LRB- Arolsen , 2 August 1858 â `` Den Haag , 20 March 1934 -RRB- , Princess of Orange-Nassau , Princess of Waldeck-Pyrmont , was the second wife of king William III of the Netherlands . She was married to him from 1879 until he died in 1890 . After his death , she became Queen-Regent of the Netherlands because her daughter Wilhelmina was only 10 when her father died , and too young to become queen .
Emma was the fourth of seven children . Her father was George Victor , king of Waldeck and Pyrmont , and her mother was Helena , Princess of Nassau-Weilburg . Her grandmother on her father 's side , Emma of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym , was a grandchild of princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau and Karel Christiaan of Nassau-Weilburg . Her grandfather on her mother 's side , Willem of Nassau-Weilburg , was also their grandchild . This means that Emma was related to the House of Orange-Nassau through two family connections .
The princess grew up in Schloss Arolsen in Germany . Her daughter , the later Queen Wilhelmina wrote in her autobiography that her mother 's home life was very modern and well informed for that time .
The king was married before , to his cousin Sophie of WÃ 1\/4 rttemberg . She died in 1877 . Their marriage was unhappy , they had lived apart since 1855 . William III had a few relationships outside his first marriage . The newspapers even reported on his relationships with the American barmaid Elisa Parker and the opera singer Leonora d'Ambre from Paris .
After Sophie died , and the sons did not marry anyone , William thought it best to re-marry . That way , the family name of Orange would not die out . He met Sophie after going to her house to meet her older sister Pauline . He had also looked into marrying his niece Elisabeth van Saksen-Weimar-Eisenach .
When they were engaged in September 1878 , Emma was 20 years old , and William was 61 . They married on 7 January 1879 , and on 31 August 1880 , Wilhelmina was born .
The first years of the marriage were happy for Queen Emma . She liked to do woodcarving , and spent a lot of time in her workshop in Utrecht . She also spent a lot of time on taking care of her Wimmy . But soon things changed . In 1884 , William 's youngest son Alexander died . He was 32 years old , and was not married . William 's other sons had already died : Maurits in 1850 age 6 , and William in 1879 aged 38 . This meant that princess Wilhelmina would now be next in line to become Queen .
The princess was only three years old . The King was 65 . Because of the age difference , the government voted for Emma to become Regent . This meant that if the king died before Wilhelmina was 18 years old , Emma would do the job of Queen until Wilhelmina was old enough to take over .
The health of the King went downhill fast in 1888 . In May the family moved from The Hague to their palace in the quiet of Apeldoorn . The king could no longer rule the country . The government voted that Queen Emma would be Regent , and she took the oath to rule for her husband on 20 November in The Hague . She only ruled in his place for three days , William died on 23rd November 1890 . He was 73 years old . From that day , at 10 years old , Wilhelmina officially became the Queen . Emma became Queen-regent for her daughter until 1898 .
Emma worked in the same way as her husband . She made sure she would meet all ministers once every fourteen days . Unlike her husband , she opened up for everyone who wanted to speak to her . She also opened a lot of the post that was sent to her personally . In her period as Queen-widow-regent , she had to reshuffle her cabinet three times . She found this a difficult task .

The Nizam ate seven kulchas and the holy man predicted that seven generations of his family would rule the state .
By tradition no Nizam has ever left India , even if there was good a reason .
Hyderabad did not join the first war of Indian Independence of 1857 against the British . Therefore its Royal Family had special , official status of Faithful Ally with Britain .

In physics , the angular momentum of an object rotating about some reference point is the measure of the extent to which the object will continue to rotate about that point when acted upon by an external torque .
In particular , if a point mass rotates about an axis , then the angular momentum with respect to a point on the axis is related to the mass of the object , the velocity and the distance of the mass to the axis .
Angular momentum is important in physics because it is a conserved quantity : a system 's angular momentum stays constant unless an external torque acts on it . Torque is the rate at which angular momentum is transferred in or out of the system . When a rigid body rotates , its resistance to a change in its rotational motion is measured by its moment of inertia .
where , F is the force vector , and r is the vector from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is acting .
Angular momentum is an important concept in both physics and engineering , with numerous applications . For example , the kinetic energy stored in a massive rotating object such as a flywheel is proportional to the square of the angular momentum .
Conservation of angular momentum also explains many phenomena in nature .

In the physical sciences , mass and weight are different . Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in the body while weight is a measure of the force on the object caused by a gravitational field .
This means the mass of an object will remain at wherever it is on the earthâ s surface , but if it is moved from the equator to the North Pole , its weight will grow by 0.5 % because of the increase in the earthâ s gravitational field . Mass to the general means of how â heavyâ something is . However , mass is really an inertial property ; that is , the tendency of an object to remain at constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force . According to Newton 's second law of motion , as expressed in the formula an object with a mass , m , of one kilogram will accelerate , a , at one meter per second per second -LRB- about one-tenth the acceleration due to earthâ s gravity -RRB- when acted upon by a force , F , of one newton .
The Entscheidungsproblem -LRB- German , `` decision problem '' -RRB- is a famous problem of mathematics . David Hilbert formulated the problem in 1928 : Is there an algorithm that will take a formal language , and a logical statement in that language , and that will output `` True '' or `` False '' , depending on the truth value of the statement . The algorithm does not tell how it reaches the answer , orprove it , as long as the answer is always correct .
In 1936 and 1937 , Alonzo Church and Alan Turing showed inedpendently , that there can be no anser to the Entscheidingsproblem . They showed that it is impossible for an algorithm to decide whether statements in arithmetic are true or false . For this reason , there can be no solution for the Entscheidingsproblem .

The Guardian Legend is a video game made by Compile in 1988 . It is played on the Nintendo Entertainment System . The player controls a half-person half-robot woman set to destroy a large alien moon before it gets to Earth . To do this , the player activates ten devices within the moon . Like Metroid , the game stars a female as the character .
The Guardian Legend got mixed reviews from Electronic Gaming Monthly and Nintendo Power . People liked the game for how it looked , sounded , and felt . Other people did not like the game because the play was the same . It also had a very long password . The game was not well-known at first , but it is more known now . It is an example of a game where players do different things .
In The Guardian Legend , the player controls the female guardian of Earth , a `` robot transformer '' ; the Japanese version of the game calls her `` Miria '' . The player is to destroy the alien moon Naju before it gets to Earth . The player needs to turn on the moon 's self-destruct device and escape the moon before it gets to Earth . Five alien tribes who try to control the moon stand in the way of the player . To help players along , messages left by a person help guide them in finding the safety switches to turn on the self-destruct device . These messages also help players get to some other rooms .
The player controls the Guardian in human form while walking on Naju 's surface , called the `` Labyrinth '' . When in Naju , the Guardian turns into a spaceship in which the player can move around . The Guardian has a life meter that drops when hit by alien attacks . Players can pick up items to help fill the Guardian 's life meter again . If the life meter runs out , then the Guardian dies , ending the game . The player can shoot at aliens with different types of weapons by pressing buttons on the gamepad . Players get different and better weapons during play .
Round , colored creatures in the game named `` Landers '' appear in the game to help players . Landers can help fill the Guardian 's life meter and increase the number of times players can fire weapons . Blue Landers may sell weapons to players . They also give out passwords . Passwords let players stop the game and come back to it later .
The player goes through the Labyrinth and find entrances to the Dungeon . The ten safety devices are located in the Dungeon . The Labyrinth is made up of many rooms that are as big as the screen . Players can look at a map to see where they are at . This map can be looked at while the game is paused . Players can either walk from one room to another , or they can go to another room through a `` warp panel '' . Some of these warp panels require the right key to go through . Many rooms contain aliens . Other rooms contain clues , shops , passwords , and entrances to the Dungeon .
The Dungeon contains areas in which the Guardian flies through as a spaceship . The Dungeon has many aliens to destroy . At the end of an area in the Dungeon , there is a boss , a very strong alien that must be destroyed . After destroying the boss , the Guardian flies out of the Dungeon and back into the Labyrinth . The player then gets a power-up . The player may also receive a key for a warp panel . Some entrances to the Dungeon are already open . Other entrances need a certain task completed before going in . Clues in the Labyrinth tell players how to get into these entrances .
The Guardian Legend was made for the Famicom and came out in 1988 in Japan . It came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1989 and in Europe in 1990 . The people who created the game were the same who created Guardic , Zanac , and Puyo Puyo .
Reviewers liked the game for its multiple features . Some have compared the game to other Nintendo games like The Legend of Zelda and Metroid . Mike Engler , who made Retro Game Challenge , said that `` The Guardian Legend is one of the best games ever released '' . The game was nominated by Nintendo Power magazine in 1989 for `` Best Graphics & Sound '' , `` Best Play Control '' , and `` Best Overall '' but did not win any of them . Some of the music of the game were remixed .
The Apicomplexa are a large group of protists which are pathogenic parasitic protozoa .
They have a unique apical complex for penetrating a host 's cell , and an organelle called an apicoplast .
They are unicellular , spore-forming , and exclusively parasites of animals . Motile structures such as flagella or pseudopods are absent except in certain gamete stages .
Apicomplexans have complex life cycles , and there is much variation among different apicomplexan groups . Both asexual and sexual reproduction occur .
This is a diverse group including organisms such as coccidia , gregarines , piroplasms , hemogregarines , and malarias . Diseases caused by apicomplexan organisms include :

Zermatt is a municipality in the district of Visp in the canton of Valais in Switzerland .
It is found to the north of the Matterhorn in the German-speaking and mostly Roman Catholic section of the canton . It is pretty far southeast of Gstaad , and is pretty close to the border with Italy .
Zermatt has a local population of 5,500 people , but the actual population changes through the seasons as tourists come and go .
Zermatt is a famed ski resort and is a tourist destination . Until the mid-1800s , it was mostly a farming community ; its name , as well as that of the Matterhorn itself , derives from the alpine meadows , or matten , in the valley . In the German language , the town is `` Zur Matte '' , or `` in the meadow . ''
The town was `` discovered '' mid-century by British mountaineers , most notably Edward Whymper , whose conquest of the Matterhorn made the village famous worldwide .
Zermatt is a closed village , which means that non-Swiss nationals are not permitted to buy property within the area . May is the worst time to visit this city , as most of the streets are muddy .
Zermatt is a good place to start many hikes into the surrounding mountains , such as the Haute Route that ultimately leads to Chamonix in France . A complex of cable cars and chair lifts carry skiers in the winter and hikers in the summer ; the highest of them leads to the Klein Matterhorn , a small outcropping on the ridge between Breithorn and Matterhorn that offers cool views in all directions . It is possible to cross into Italy via the Cervinia cable car station .
Any automobile that uses an engine is not allowed in Zermatt because of concerns for air pollution . Electric vehicles are allowed for local commerces . The Cantonal police allow some people to park in the northern section of this city . Some emergency vehicles -LRB- firetrucks , ambulance , . . -RRB- are also allowed to use combustion engines .
Most people reach Zermatt by train or cable car . Trains also leave for Zermatt from Visp and Brig .
Zermatt is well known throughout the world for its great skiing , especially Triftji for its moguls . The high altitude results in consistent skiing continuously up until the summer . Skiing in Zermatt is split up into four distinct areas ; Sunnegga , Gornegrat , Klein Matterhorn and Schwarzsee . There is also a connection to Cervinia and Valtournenche in Italy . Trail Map .

Sequence analysis in molecular biology involves identifying the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid , or amino acids in a peptide or protein . Once a sample has been obtained , DNA sequences may be produced automatically by machine and the result displayed on computer . Interpreting those results is still a task for humans .
Information from sequence analysis is used in many fields of biology . It gives information on the relationship between individual organisms , or between groups of organisms . It shows how closely related they are .
A DNA sequence is the sequence of nucleotides in a DNA molecule . It is written as a succession of letters representing the primary structure of a DNA molecule or strand . If functional , such a sequence carries information for the sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule . The possible letters are A , C , G , and T , representing the four nucleotide bases of a DNA strand â '' adenine , cytosine , guanine , thymine . The sequences are printed next to one another , without gaps , as in the sequence AAAGTCTGAC .
The study of RNA and proteins is more complex . The overall structure of DNA is simple and predictable -LRB- double helix -RRB- . The study of RNA and proteins must include a study of their 3-dimensional structure , which is varied , and influences how they work . To some extent this can be assisted by computer , but has to be verified in each case .
Information on sequences is kept in databases . Since the development of fast production of gene and protein sequences during the 1990s , the rate of addition of new sequences to the databases increases all the time .
Complete genome analysis has been done on just over 100 species . The work is done by a machine , the DNA sequencer , which analyses light signals from fluorochromes attached to the nucleotides . This type of work is gradually becoming less expensive .
Charles Augustus Lindbergh -LRB- February 4 , 1902 â `` August 26 , 1974 -RRB- , known as `` Lucky Lindy '' and `` The Lone Eagle '' , was a pioneering United States airplane pilot famous for making the first solo non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927 .
Lindbergh was born in Detroit , Michigan . His parents were Swedish immigrants . He grew up in Little Falls , Minnesota . His father , Charles August Lindbergh , was a lawyer and later a U.S. congressman who was against the United States entering into World War I ; his mother was a teacher . While he was young , he was interested in machines . In 1922 he joined a pilot training program with Nebraska Aircraft , bought his own airplane , and became a stunt pilot . In 1924 , he started training as a pilot with the United States Army Air Corps .
After finishing first in his class , Lindbergh took his first job as pilot of an airmail route in St. Louis . He flew the mail in an airplane .
In April 1923 , while visiting friends in Lake Village , Arkansas , Lindbergh made his first ever flight over Lake Village and Lake Chicot .
Lindbergh gained fame around the world as the first pilot to fly solo -LRB- alone -RRB- and non-stop across the Atlantic Ocean . He flew from Roosevelt Airfield -LRB- Nassau County , Long Island -RRB- , New York , USA to Paris , France on May 20-May 21 , 1927 in his single-engine airplane The Spirit of St. Louis . He needed 33.5 hours for the trip . When he arrived back in the United States , many warships and aircraft escorted him to Washington , D.C. where President Calvin Coolidge gave him the Distinguished Flying Cross .
Lindbergh 's act won him the Orteig Prize , which was 25,000 US dollars . A parade was held for him on 5th Avenue in New York City on June 13 , 1927 . At the end of the year , he was named Times first Man of the Year . His public respect following this flight was such that he became an important voice on behalf of aviation activities until his death . He served on a variety of national and international boards and committees , including the central committee of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in the United States . On March 21 , 1929 he was presented the Medal of Honor for his historic trans-Atlantic flight .
Lindbergh is honored in aviation for mapping out polar air-routes , flying at high altitudes , and decreasing fuel use . These things are the basis of modern air travel .
Lindbergh married Anne Morrow in 1929 . In 1932 he made headlines again , when his baby son , Charles Lindbergh III , was kidnapped and murdered . Bruno Hauptmann was convicted of the crime and later put to death in the electric chair . The Lindberghs later moved to Europe . He died on August 26 , 1974 .
Snorks is an animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions , and created by Belgian comics Freddy Monnickendam .
The Snorks are a race of small , colorful , fictional beings that live happily in the underwater world of Snorkland . They have snorkels on their heads , which are used to propel them swiftly through the water . As evidenced by the cartoon series , when a Snork becomes excited their tube makes a `` snork '' sound . Like the Flintstones or the Smurfs , they have much of the same technology as contemporary humans , adapted to their own aquatic environment . The Snorks use clams as currency , a reference to the slang word `` clam '' , meaning `` dollar . ''
According to the Snork back-story , a few ventured to the surface -LRB- which the Snorks believe is `` outer space '' -RRB- in 1643 , and watched a Royal Navy ship being attacked by pirates . The captain wound up in the water , and that was the first contact between the species when the Snorks saved his life , to which the captain then expressed his gratitude by writing a book about the Snorks , although very few humans believe in the existence of the Snorks . Since then , Snorks have adopted several human habits , such as wearing clothes .
An acute myocardial infarction , also known as a heart attack , is a heart condition where blood can not get to part of the heart . This causes cells in the heart to die and can cause the heart to fail . Most of the time , an artery in the heart is blocked by a blood clot . When this happens for more than about twenty minutes , the heart muscle is damaged .
The most common symptom are strong pains in the chest . The pain may also be present in the shoulders , the belly , and the mandible . In contrast to angina pectoris , a myocardial infarction always damages the heart muscle .
A myocardial infaction is considered a medical emergency . The first few minutes can be essential for the survival of a patient ; within the first hour , there are good chances to reverse some of the damage done .
Signs that a person is having a heart attack become visible over several minutes , and rarely come straight away . Most people having a heart attack experience chest pain . Chest pain can be caused by ischemia -LRB- a lack of blood and oxygen -RRB- of the heart muscle ; this is called angina pectoris . Pain can often also be felt in the left arm , and sometimes in the lower jaw , the neck , the right arm , the back , and in parts of the abdomen .
Many women have different symptoms than men . The most common symptoms include shortness of breath , weakness , and feeling tired . Some women feel tired , do not sleep properly , and experience shortness of breath for up to a month before they have a heart attack .
A heart attack is a medical emergency that needs to be taken care of as quickly as possible . The ultimate goal of the management in the acute phase of the disease is to save as much myocardium as possible and prevent more complications . As time passes , the risk of damage to the heart muscle increases .
The treatments itself may have complications . If medics try to get the blood flowing again after only a few hours , the result is reperfusion injury instead of amelioration . Other treatment modalities may also cause complications ; the use of antithrombotics for example carries an increased risk of bleeding .
When a person starts experiencing symptoms of a myocardial infarction , many people wait three hours , on average , before asking for help when they should seek emergency assistance as soon as they can . Having the person sit in certain positions can help minimize breathing difficulties . A half-sitting position with knees bent is often recommended . The person should also be given access to more oxygen . Aspirin , which reduces the amount of platelets in the blood , can help prevent more blood clots from forming inside the arteries and the heart .

Canton Ticino or Ticino -LRB- -LRB- ti ` tÊ iË no -RRB- ; French and German : Tessin -LRB- te 's É Ì -RRB- and -LRB- te ` si : n -RRB- -RRB- is the southernmost canton of Switzerland . The written language is Italian in almost the entire canton -LRB- except the Walser municipality of Bosco Gurin , where it is German -RRB- . It surrounds the Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia . Together with areas of the canton of GraubÃ 1\/4 nden it makes up the so-called Svizzera Italiana -LRB- Italian Switzerland -RRB- . Lombard dialects -LRB- Ticinese -RRB- are still spoken , especially in the valleys , but they have no official status . It is named after the Ticino river .
The canton of Ticino is located in the south of Switzerland . It is almost entirely surrounded by Italy which lies to its east , west and south . To the north lie the cantons of Valais and Uri , to the northeast the canton of GraubÃ 1\/4 nden .
Its area is 2,812 kmÂ , of which about three quarters are considered productive . Forests cover about a third of the area , but also the lakes Maggiore and Lugano make up a considerable part of the total area . These lakes are known with the above listed names , but are officially named Lake Verbano and Lake Ceresio .
The canton is split geographically in two parts by the Monte Ceneri pass . The northern , more mountainous part , called Sopraceneri , is formed by the two major Swiss valleys around the lake Maggiore : Ticino Valley and Maggia Valley . The southern part , called Sottoceneri , is the region around the Lake Lugano .
The River Ticino is the largest river in the canton . It drains most of the canton , flowing from the northwest through the Bedretto Valley and the Leventina valley to enter Lake Maggiore near Locarno . Its main tributaries are the Brenno in the Blenio Valley and the Moesa in the Mesolcina Valley in GraubÃ 1\/4 nden . The lands of the canton are shaped by the river , which in its mid portion forms a wide valley , commonly known as the Riviera .
The western lands of the canton , however , are drained by the Maggia River . The Verzasca Valley is located between the Ticino river and the Maggia river . There is also a smaller area that drains directly into the Lake Lugano . Most of the land is considered within the Alps , but a small area is part of the plain of the River Po which drains the north of Italy .
In ancient times the area of what is today Ticino was settled by the Lepontii , a Celtic tribe . Later , probably around the rule of Augustus , it became part of the Roman Empire . After the fall of the Western Empire , was ruled by the Ostrogoths , the Lombards and the Franks . Around 1100 CE it was the center of struggle between the free communes of Milan and Como : in the 14th century it was definitively acquired by the Visconti , Dukes of Milan . In the 15th century the Swiss Confederates conquered the valleys south of the Alps in three separate conquests .
The Canton of Uri conquered the Leventina Valley in 1440 . Between 1403 and 1422 some of these lands were already annexed by forces from Uri , but subsequently lost . In a second conquest Uri , Schwyz and Nidwalden gained the town of Bellinzona and the Riviera in 1500 . Some of the land and the town Bellinzona itself were previously annexed by Uri in 1419 but lost again in 1422 . The third conquest was fought by troops from the entire Confederation -LRB- at that time constituted by 12 cantons -RRB- . In 1512 Locarno , the Maggia Valley , Lugano and Mendrisio were annexed . Subsequently , the upper valley of the Ticino River , from the St. Gotthard to the town of Biasca -LRB- Leventina Valley -RRB- was part of Canton Uri . The remaining territory -LRB- Baliaggi Ultramontani , Ennetbergische Vogteien , the Bailiwicks Beyond the Mountains -RRB- was administered by the Twelve Cantons .
The lands of the canton of Ticino are the last lands to be conquered by the Swiss Confederation . -LRB- After the battle of Marignano in 1515 the king of France Francis I defeated the Confederates , and they gave up any further conquests . -RRB- In February 1798 an attempt of annexation by the Cisalpine Republic was repelled by a volunteer militia in Lugano . Between 1798 and 1803 , during the Helvetic Republic , the districts of Bellinzona and Lugano were separate cantons , but in 1803 the two were unified to form the canton of Ticino that joined the Swiss Confederation as a full member in the same year . During the Napoleonic Wars , many Ticinese -LRB- as was the case for other Swiss -RRB- served in Swiss military units allied with the French .
Until 1878 the three largest cities , Bellinzona , Lugano and Locarno , alternated as capital of the canton . In 1878 , however , Bellinzona became the only and permanent capital .
The current constitution dates from 1997 . The previous constitution , heavily modified , dates from 1830 , nearly 20 years before the constitution of actual Swiss Confederation .
The cantonal parliament is the Grand Council -LRB- Italian : Gran Consiglio -RRB- , with 90 members and the government -LRB- Consiglio di Stato -RRB- has 5 members -LRB- Consiglieri di Stato -RRB- . In the both councils the members are elected with the proportional electoral system . The canton sends two deputies to the Swiss Council of States -LRB- upper house -RRB- , and eight deputies to the National Council -LRB- lower house -RRB- . It 's regional capitol is Bellinzona .
The main agricultural production is wine , mostly merlot , a type of red wine . It is followed by horticulture , milk and cheese production .
The hilly slopes of the canton are used extensively for the production of hydroelectricity . The electricity produced is used at home and sold for export . There is cattle breeding in the northern areas . The production of wine is important in the canton and exported to mainly other areas in Switzerland . The vineyards are mostly concentrated in the southern half of the canton where the climate is warmer . Other agricultural produce includes corn -LRB- maize -RRB- , potatoes , tobacco and vegetables .
The weather in the canton is often inverse to that north of the Alps . This , and a warmer climate in general , attracts many tourists from other Swiss cantons . The lakes together with the sunshine are considered attractive . Tourism is the single most important economic factor in the canton .
There is also light industry , mostly concentrated around the three largest towns of Lugano , Locarno and Bellinzona .
The canton is well connected to the rest of Switzerland . There are tunnels underneath the Gotthard massive , both for rail and road . The canton of Grisons -LRB- GraubÃ 1\/4 nden -RRB- is connected with a direct coach link , whereas the canton of Valais is connected by rail through a tunnel at the Simplon Pass . There are good rail links to Milan and Rome in Italy as well as Germany via Basel and ZÃ 1\/4 rich .
Because of the tourist trade there are a number of small railways in scenic areas in the mountains . Winter sports is important , despite being less developed .
There are two major centres of education and research located in the canton of Ticino . The University of Italian speaking Switzerland -LRB- USI , UniversitÃ della Svizzera Italiana -RRB- is the only Swiss university teaching in Italian . The University of Applied Sciences of Italian speaking Switzerland -LRB- SUPSI , Scuola Universitaria Professionale della Svizzera Italiana -RRB- on the other hand is a professional training college focused on a practical method of teaching in the areas of applied art , economy , social work , technology and production science .
Three daily newspapers are published in Ticino : Corriere del Ticino , La Regione , and Giornale del Popolo . These represent the only Italian daily publications in Switzerland .
The official language , and the one used for most written communication , is Italian . In oral communication Western Lombard -LRB- Ticinese -RRB- varieties , although receding in favor of Italian -LRB- especially in the cities of Lugano , Ascona and Locarno and among the younger generations -RRB- , are still well preserved . These are further subdivided into local variations , with the northern valleys speaking a dialect more closely aligned with Romansch , Switzerland 's fourth official language . There is a certain amount of popular literature -LRB- poems , comedies , etc. -RRB- in Ticinese , and the national radio and televisions trasmit regularly program in Ticinese -LRB- mainly comedies -RRB- .
The population is mostly Roman Catholic -LRB- 75 % -RRB- or Protestant -LRB- 7 % -RRB- . About 2 % each are Orthodox or Muslim .
There are 195 municipalities in the canton -LRB- as of February 2006 -RRB- . These municipalities -LRB- comuni -RRB- are grouped in 38 circoli -LRB- circles or sub-districts -RRB- which are in turn grouped into districts -LRB- distretti -RRB- . Since late 1990 there is an ongoing project of group some municipalities together -LRB- as they are small -RRB- .

Anne of Austria -LRB- 22 September 1601 -- 20 January 1666 -RRB- , Anne dâ Autriche in French , was Queen consort of France and Navarre . She also acted as a regent for her son , Louis XIV of France . During her regency -LRB- 1643 -- 1651 -RRB- Cardinal Mazarin served as France 's chief minister .
The birth of Anne of Austria was at Benavente Palace in Valladolid , Spain . She came into the world just five days before her future husband , Louis XIII . She was baptized Ana MarÃ a Mauricia . She was the oldest daughter of Habsburg parents , Philip III of Spain and Margaret of Austria . She was called the Infanta of Spain and of Portugal , Archduchess of Austria , Princess of Burgundy and of the Low Countries . Anne 's mother died early at the Valladolid . She died after giving birth to a third daughter , Marguerite . Anne was 11 years old when she was betrothed to Louis XIII . Her father , Philip , gave her a dowry of 500,000 crowns . He also gave her a great number of beautiful jewels . They had some fears that Louis XIII would die early . Anne 's father said that if this happened , Anne must return to Spain with her dowry , jewels , and wardrobe . Shortly after , on November 1615 , Anne and Louis were married separately , but to one another . This is called a proxy marriage . They were both 14 years old .
Louis 's mother , Marie de ' Medici , continued to be the Queen of France . She did not discuss things with her daughter-in-law . Anne , with her Spanish ladies-in-waiting , continued to live according to Spanish custom . She failed to improve her French .
The duc de Luynes tried to make the queen and king closer . He sent away the Spanish ladies and hired French ones instead . Some of the more famous ones are the princesse de Conti and Marie de Rohan-Montbazon , the duchesse de Chevreuse . She was his wife . He also organized court events that would bring the queen and king together more happily . Anne began to dress in the French manner .
However , a number of ` wretched miscarriages ' again made their relations cold . On 14 March 1622 , while playing with her ladies , Anne fell on the stairs . She suffered her second miscarriage . Louis angrily blamed her . He was also upset with Mme de Luynes for not being careful enough . After this , the King grew to dislike the influence the duchesse de Luynes had over Anne . He disliked the duchesse even more when Luynes died -LRB- December 1621 -RRB- . Anne remained without a child for 16 more years .
Through his life Louis had a cool behavior towards Anne . He was always fearful that his wife `` had a great passion for the interests of Spain '' . In 1625 the English George Villiers , 1st duke of Buckingham , shocked the French court by admitting his passion for Anne . Madame de Motteville said that , `` if a respectable woman could love a man other than her husband , it would have been Buckingham '' .
Surprisingly , while there was such a strain between Anne and Louis at this time , Anne suddenly had a baby . Suspicious people suggested that Cardinal Richelieu was the child 's parent . Another , more likely suggestion , was that there was one night with a storm that stopped Louis from going to Saint-Maur and made him sleep with the queen instead . This was the night of 5 December 1637 . However , the official newspaper , the Gazette de France , does not mention if they slept in the same room .
A royal birthing-bed was made ready . It was three feet wide , and had two long sticks made of wood for Anne to hold while she was giving birth to her baby . On 4 Saturday September , Anne finally went into labor . She gave birth in the sight of the court . This was so that if her child was a boy , it would not be changed for a girl , or a living baby to a dead one . The child was safely delivered . The Gazette de France called it `` a marvel when it was least expected '' , and Anne had a son for the first time in 22 years .
The queen 's joy in Louis was very great . One of her servants said , `` She takes great joy in playing with him ... it is her great pleasure in life . '' There are a great number of suggestions as why she did not show such a great love for Monsieur , her second son .
Almost exactly two years after Louis , Anne had another son , Philippe . He was born on 22 September 1640 . He was known as ` Monsieur ' . This was the official title for the king 's second son .
It is said that Anne of Austria died from breast cancer in a convent . Her lady-in-waiting , Madame de Motteville , wrote the story of the queen 's life in her MÃ moires d'Anne d'Autriche .
A trumpet is a brass instrument used mainly in Classical music and jazz music . The most common type of trumpet is a Bb trumpet , meaning that if the player plays a C , it will sound like a Bb in concert pitch . The trumpet is played by blowing into the mouthpiece and making a `` buzzing '' sound . There are three keys called valves that the player can press to change the pitch .
The trumpet has been around for about 3000 years . An early example of a brass instrument like a trumpet is called a shofar , which is still used in religious ceremonies . Eventually people started making trumpet-like instruments with wood -LRB- for example , the cornetto -RRB- , and later , with brass .
Many years ago , when the use of instrumental music was growing , trumpets became very important . Trumpets were long and without valves . This meant a player had to control the pitch of the sound with only his mouth , which was very difficult . Everyone respected trumpet players because trumpets were just so difficult to play .
The chromatic trumpet was developed in the late 18th century . Later on , valves were developed , and it became easier to play notes on the trumpet . Still , trumpet is a difficult instrument to master .
Classical music is written for solo trumpet , and trumpets are included in orchestras . Trumpets play an important part in Jazz music , and other various popular genres . Sometimes , they also play short parts to emphasize sections in rock songs .
Some famous classical trumpet players are Adolph Herseth , Sergei Nakariakov and Maurice Andre .
Some famous jazz trumpet players are Miles Davis , Louis Armstrong , Arturo Sandoval , Wynton Marsalis , Dizzy Gillepsie , and Maynard Ferguson .
The Green River Formation is a 48 million year old Eocene rock formation . It records sediment from a group of intermountain lakes . Its fine fossils make this a lagerstÃ tte , a place of exceptional preservation .
The sediments are deposited in very fine layers , in pairs . A dark layer from the growing season , and a light-hue inorganic layer in winter .
Each pair of layers is called a varve and represents one year . The sediments of the Green River Formation present a continuous record of six million years . The mean thickness of a varve here is 0.18 mm , with a minimum thickness of 0.014 mm and maximum of 9.8 mm .
The sedimentary layers were formed in a large area named after the present-day Green River , a tributary of the Colorado River . The formation is in three separate basins around the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah :
The formation has many evaporites -- minerals formed by the evaporation of lakes . This suggests that high salinity was one of the causes of the superb fossilisation .
Another factor was the frequent ash falls from nearby volcanoes . Rapid burial also prevents normal decomposition .
Fossils preserved suggest that the region was a low , subtropical , freshwater basin when the sediments accumulated .
The Green River fossils show a transition between the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene . The climate was moist and mild enough to support crocodiles , which do not tolerate frost , and the lakes were surrounded by sycamore forests . As the lake configurations shifted , each Green River location is distinct in character and time . The lake system formed over underlying river deltas and shifted in the flat landscape with slight tectonic movements
The Green River Formation contains the largest oil shale deposits in the world . The 213 billion tons of oil shale contain an estimated 2.38 Ã -- 10 Â Â mÂ -LRB- 1.5 trillion US barrels -RRB- of shale oil . This is a tribute to the high volume of organic material that was buried . The source of the organic material was probably cyanobacteria , which thrive in warm alkaline lake conditions .
The lagerstÃ tten formed in anoxic conditions in the fine carbonate muds that formed in the lakebeds . Lack of oxygen slowed bacterial decomposition and kept scavengers away . Leaves of palms , ferns and sycamores , some showing the insect damage got during their growth , were covered with fine-grained sediment and preserved . Insects were preserved whole , even delicate wing membranes and spider spinnerets .

A sponge is a member of the phylum Porifera . It is a simple animal with no mouth , no muscles , no heart and no brain . It is sessile : it can not move from place to place the way most other animals can . A sponge is an animal that grows in one spot like most plants do . Nevertheless , the phylum is quite successful .
There are more than 10,000 different species of sponge . Most sponges live in the ocean . Some live near the edge of the sea . Others live in deep water . A few sponges live in fresh water . All sponges take in water through pores -LRB- little holes -RRB- in their bodies . The water goes out through a big tube in the center . Most Sponges filter -LRB- take out -RRB- little bits of food from the water going through their bodies . Animals that get food this way are called filter feeders .
Sponges are simple animals , but they do have a few things that make them different from other animals .
There are 3 different kinds of sponges . The difference between these kinds is in how their skeleton is made .
Sponges are sessile , they live in one place , where they are fixed to the ground . A few sponges are capable of changing their position , they can move at speeds of between 1 mm and 4 mm a day . They do this like amoebae . A few species can contract their whole bodies , and many can close their openings\/holes .
A few species live in waters where there is very little food available . They have therefore changed , and became predators . They prey on small crustaceans and other small animals . Most of these sponges belong to the family Cladorhizidae , but a few members of the Guitarridae and Esperiopsidae are also carnivores . In most cases little is known about how they actually capture prey . Some species are thought to use either sticky threads or hooked spicules . Most carnivorous sponges live in deep waters , up to 8840 m , and the development of deep-ocean exploration techniques is expected to lead to the discovery of several more . However one species has been found in Mediterranean caves at depths of 17-23m alongside the more usual filter feeding sponges . The cave-dwelling predators capture crustaceans under 1 m long by entangling them with fine threads , digest them by enveloping them with further threads over the course of a few days , and then return to their normal shape ; there is no evidence that they use venom .
Most known carnivorous sponges have completely lost the water flow system and choanocytes . However the genus Chondrocladia uses a highly modified water flow system to inflate balloon-like structures that are used for capturing prey .
Sponges usually reproduce -LRB- make more of their kind -RRB- when little pieces break off . If such a piece has the right types of cells it can grow to become a new sponge . A few sponges can also use budding . With budding a small sponge grows on the parent ; when it is done growing , it simply falls off . When the conditions are bad , some sponges can also grow lumps of unspecialised cells . These will not develop until the conditions improve again . They can then either make a new sponge , or they can use the skeleton of the parent sponge -LRB- that died -RRB- . Most sponges reproduce sexually . They can make sperm cells that are released into the water . These are either captured by another sponge , and are then transported to the egg cells of the parent . This is known as viviparous . Both cells are joined to form larvae , which can swim off to find a good place to settle .
The other option , known as oviparous is that both sperm cells and egg cells are released into the water . These then combine outside the sponges .
A report in 1997 described how bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay used sponges as tools : A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum -LRB- snoutlike projection -RRB- . It is thought the sponge is used to protect the rostrum when the dolphin is looking for food in the sandy sea bottom but scientists have not confirmed this . The behavior , known as sponging , has only been observed in this bay , and is almost exclusively shown by females . A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters , and that all the sponge-users are closely related . This suggests that it is a fairly recent innovation .
The calcium carbonate or silica spicules of most sponges make them too rough for most uses , but two genera , Hippospongia and Spongia , have soft , entirely fibrous skeletons . Early Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes including padding for helmets , portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters . Until synthetic sponges were invented , they were also used as cleaning tools , for painting , and as contraceptives . In the 20th century overfishing is a problem ; this has caused the animals , as well as the industry behind it to be close to extinction .
Many objects with sponge-like textures are now made of substances that do not come from poriferans . Synthetic `` sponges '' include : personal and household cleaning tools ; breast implants ; contraceptive sponges .
The luffa `` sponge '' , also spelled loofah , which is commonly sold for use in the kitchen or the shower , is not derived from an animal but from the fibrous `` skeleton '' of a gourd -LRB- Cucurbitaceae -RRB- .

Allen Klein -LRB- born December 18 , 1931 - died July 4 , 2009 -RRB- is an American businessman , of Hungarian and Jewish descent . He studied to become an accountant , and made his living as the business manager of many celebrities , musicians in particular . He married a woman named Betty , after he graduated from college .
Klein first became well-known when he helped a singer , Bobby Darin , to recover money owed to him by his record label . Darin received a $ 100,000 check for unpaid royalties , and split it with Klein . Klein was called the `` Robin Hood '' of popular music , liked by artists but hated by the companies they worked for .
Klein bought a struggling record label , Cameo-Parkway , and tried to make it more profitable . When he got into legal trouble for `` talking up '' the value of shares in the company , he changed his plans . He merged Cameo-Parkway with his own accounting firm , creating a company called ABKCO -LRB- for Allen and Betty Klein and Company -RRB- .
Among Klein 's clients were pop singers Connie Francis , Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme , R&B singer Sam Cooke , folk musician Donovan , record producer Phil Spector , and rock bands Herman 's Hermits , The Animals , The Rolling Stones and The Beatles . While he helped his clients with money matters , and to make new contracts that paid them better , not all his business choices were the best for his clients . Klein ended up owning much of the music of the Rolling Stones , the Animals and other artists , which cut into their long-term earnings . The artists also sometimes lost the goodwill of the businesses they dealt with , because of Klein 's work for them .
Klein played a role in the breakup of the Beatles . He impressed John Lennon enough to sign up with him overnight , and Lennon persuaded George Harrison and Ringo Starr to go along . Paul McCartney , though , decided to let his wife Linda 's father Lee Eastman become his manager . Eastman and Klein did not get along , and Eastman treated Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono poorly . Disagreements on what the Beatles should be doing with their company Apple Corps , and their own business interests , helped to tear the band apart .
After the Beatles broke up , Lennon , Harrison and Starr liked the things Klein did for them less and less , and eventually split with him , giving Klein a final payment of about Â # 3.5 million for his services . Later , Klein got into tax trouble , and served a jail sentence for income tax tax evasion .
Klein continued his career , and ABKCO continued to issue records from the old Cameo-Parkway label , and the artists Klein had managed . Nearly all the records were taken off the market for many years , making classic songs like `` 96 Tears '' -LRB- by ? and the Mysterians -RRB- , `` So Much In Love '' by the Tymes , and `` Bristol Stomp '' by the Dovells impossible to buy .
Klein 's son Jody became the controller of ABKCO , when Klein 's health became poor . In 2005 , ABKCO finally began to issue digital remastering compact discs of the music owned by the company . Klein died of complications from Alzheimer 's disease in July 2009 .

The Chondrostei are a sub-class of ray-finned fish , the Actinopterygii . They include the sturgeons , huge fish which provide caviar .
The Chondrostei are mainly cartilaginous fish with some ossification . There are 52 species divided among two orders . The orders are the Acipenseriformes -LRB- sturgeons and paddlefishes -RRB- , and the Polypteriformes -LRB- reedfishes and bichirs -RRB- .
This group has at times been classified with the sharks : the similarities are obvious , not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone , the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish . Both lack scales -LRB- except the Polypteriforms -RRB- . Additional shared features include spiracles and , in sturgeons , a heterocercal tail -LRB- the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin -RRB- . However the fossil record suggests that these fish have more in common with the Teleostei than their external appearance might suggest .
It is thought that the ancestors of the chondrosteans were bony fish but that this characteristic was lost in later evolutionary development , resulting in a lightening of the frame . Elderly chondrosteans show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton which suggests that this process is delayed rather than lost in these fish .
In the early Mesozoic , a number of fish families were beginning to develop adaptations which would make them lighter , faster and more efficient predators . Chondrosteans took a radical approach . Cartilage is lighter than bone , and they delayed the development of bone , so that it only developed in elderly fish . They lost the upper jaw bones completely . Other changes allowed them to shoot the jaw forwards to grab prey .

In some cases , nephrectomy can be partial rather than complete -LRB- some kidney is left behind -RRB- . However , stage IV cases of renal cell carcinoma are more difficult to treat , with current treatments including Interleukin-2 which induces a response in about 5-10 % of cases . Other treatments used include Nexavar , Torisel , Sutent , Interferon , and Bevacizumab . Surgical removal of both the primary tumor and the metastases may be considered in selected cases . Oncophage cancer vaccine may also be effective in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma . Surgery to remove liver metastases in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma involving the liver may be beneficial .

Many civilizations over thousands of years have portrayed the constellation of Leo as a lion . One theory for this is that the Sun was among its stars in Midsummer . This was the time when the lions of the Egyptian desert left their usual home for the banks of the river Nile . There they could find relief from the heat in the water . The Roman writer Pliny the Elder wrote that the Egyptians worshipped the stars of Leo . He says this is because the Nile would overflow with water at the same time as the Sun entering into the constellation .
In Egypt , the Ramesseum -LRB- the memorial temple of Pharaoh Ramesses II -RRB- at Thebes mentions Leo in the inscription on the wall . On the planisphere of Dendera Leo is shown standing on an outstretched serpent .

H.A. Rey has suggested an alternative way to connect the stars , which shows a lion walking . The stars delta Leonis , gamma Leonis , eta Leonis , and theta Leonis form the body of the lion . The stars gamma Leonis , zeta Leonis , mu Leonis , epsilon Leonis , and eta Leonis form the lion 's neck . The stars mu Leonis , kappa Leonis , lambda Leonis , and epsilon Leonis form the head of the lion . Delta Leonis and beta Leonis form the lion 's tail : beta Leonis , also known as Denebola , is the bright tip of the tail with a magnitude of two . The stars theta Leonis , iota Leonis , and sigma Leonis form the left hind leg of the lion , with sigma Leonis being the foot . The stars theta Leonis and rho Leonis form the right hind leg , with rho Leonis being the foot . The stars eta Leonis and alpha Leonis mark the lion 's heart , with alpha Leonis , also known as Regulus , being the bright star of magnitude one . The stars eta Leonis and omicron Leonis form the right front foot of the Lion . -LRB- See English wikipedia for an image . -RRB-

The octal numeral system is a base 8 numeral system . It uses the numerals 0 through 7 . The system is similar to binary -LRB- base 2 -RRB- and hexadecimal -LRB- base 16 -RRB- . Octal numerals are written using the letter o before the numeral , for example , o04 or o1242 .
At one time , the octal system was used mainly for work with computers . It provided an easier way to work with binary numbers . As computers changed from using 24 bit systems to 32 and 64 bit systems , hexadecimal replaced octal for most uses . Certain groups , for example , Native Americans using the Yuki language in California and the Pamean languages in Mexico also use octal numbering system . They do this because when they count , they use the spaces between their fingers instead of counting the actual fingers .
The octal numeral system uses a three bit binary coding . Each digit in an octal numeral is the same as three digits in a binary numeral . The grouping of the binary digits is done from right to left . The first three binary digits from the right are grouped into the last part of the octal numeral then the next three digits form the next to the last part of the numeral .
In the Decimal system -LRB- base 10 -RRB- , each digit in Octal is equal to that digit multiplied by the exponent of 8 that is equal to its location minus one .
Octal is similar to hexadecimal because they are both easily converted to binary . Where Octal is equal to three digit binary , hexadecimal is equal to four digit binary . Where octal numerals start with the letter `` o '' , hexadecimal numeral end with the letter `` h '' . The easiest way to convert from one to the other is to convert to binary and then to the other system .

For example , when people on two different boats want to send a message , they may be too far away from each other to talk , but they can send messages with a flag code . Another code that people use a lot is called Morse Code , which changes letters to dots and dashes , like this :
Computers use codes , by changing letters into 1 's and 0 's . This is called an ASCII code .
Some people write codes as a kind of game . They think it is fun to make codes , and fun to break codes . Breaking a code means taking it apart to understand how it works , and then you can understand messages that are written in that code .
In the United States , there is an organization called the NSA . Their job is to break other people 's codes , and to make codes that the United States government can use , which are hard to break .
The algorithm -LRB- code -RRB- for making a message secret is called the encryption algorithm . To change a secret message back a decryption algorithm is needed .

Use this template when you are referring to a specific page within a cited source . This example sentence shows the formatting produced by , which would be used to refer to a fact on page 23 of reference -LRB- 1 -RRB- . This second sentence is supported by a fact on page 56 of the same reference , which will only appear once in the list of references .
`` Page number -LRB- s -RRB- '' can be a single page number -LRB- 287 -RRB- , several -LRB- xii , 287 , 292 , 418 -RRB- or a range -LRB- 287 â `` 88 -RRB- or any combination thereof .

It can of course also be used for non-numeric pages , for example `` f. 29 '' , `` A7 '' , `` back cover '' , etc. , and can also be used for non-paginated sources , e.g. `` 0:35:12 '' for a video source .
This template -LRB- the name of which stands for `` reference pages '' -RRB- is for appending Harvard referencing-style page numbers to Cite.php-generated inline reference citations . It is a solution for the problem of an article with a source that must be cited many , many times , at numerous different pages . It is an alternative to the more common method of using shortened footnotes , that does not require the reader to follow two links to see the source . The Cite . php and followup 's with the same and simply mentioning all of the pages cited , in the single line generated by could result in at least 100 pages being specifically cited in a single reference citation footnote , rendering it basically unreadable and certainly useless .
The example below shows in use both at a first occurrence , with other references and inline superscript templates present so one can see how it looks when used in series , and at a later occurrence .
This is preferable to something like or , since the cleanup categorization takes place . It is preferable to simply using in articles that make use of , since it preserves the use of the syntax .
This template should not be used unless necessary . In the vast majority of cases , citing page numbers in the code is just fine . This template is only intended for sources that are used many , many times in the same article , to such an extent that normal citation would produce a useless line in or too many individual ones . Overuse of this template will make prose harder to read , and is likely to be reverted by other editors . Used judiciously , however , it is much less interruptive to the visual flow than full Harvard referencing and some other reference citation styles .

B major is a major scale based on B. Its key signature has five sharps .
B major 's relative minor is G-sharp minor , its parallel minor is B minor , and its enharmonic equivalent is C-flat major .
The key signature for B major is the least sharp key signature with three `` lines '' of sharps . In the treble clef , putting the sharp for A where it looks like it should be , next to the sharp for G , would mean that a ledger line would have to be used . In the bass clef it would be possible to do this without a ledger line , but because sight reading is easier when both staves look the same , it is not usually done in piano music . In the alto clef , used in orchestral music , the B major key signature is usually written in just two `` lines '' of sharps .
Although B major is usually thought of as a `` far away '' key because it has many sharps and is quite far from C major in the circle of fifths , FrÃ dÃ ric Chopin thought that it was the easiest scale of all to play , as its black notes fit the natural positions of the fingers well . Because of this , it was often the first scale he taught to beginning piano students , leaving the scale of C major till last because he thought it was the hardest to play .
While B major is not too difficult to play on keyboard instruments and guitar , the key of C-flat major is easier when writing music for the harp , as it is that instrument 's home key .

This process of capturing a photon and transforming it into a physiological response is known as phototransduction .
Five groups of opsins are involved in vision , mediating the conversion of a photon of light into an electrochemical signal , the first step in the visual transduction cascade .
Another opsin found in the mammalian retina , melanopsin , is involved in circadian rhythms and pupillary reflex but not in image-forming .
Dialysis is where a machine is used to replace a kidney after kidney failure . The word dialysis comes from the Greek word dialusis , dia meaning through , and lusis meaning loosening .
Dialysis can be used for people who have become sick and have lost the use of their kidneys for a short time , or for people who no longer have working kidneys . The purpose of the kidney is to keep a balance of water and minerals in the body . These minerals include sodium , potassium , chloride , calcium , phosphorous , magnesium and sulfate . The kidneys also take out hydrogen ions from the blood . Dialysis is able to remove these wastes from the body and help keep the minerals in balance .
However the kidneys are also part of the endocrine system and make erythropoietin ans calcitriol . Dialysis machines are not able to replace this part of the kidney 's function .
Dialyis machines work by using diffusion and ultrafiltration . A very fine material , called a membrane , allows blood and fluid to flow through it . In the machine , the blood flows in one direction , and on the other side of the membrane , a special fluid , dialysate flows in the opposite direction . Dialysate is a fluid that has different chemicals in it , such as potassium and calcium . A doctor would decide what mixture of chemicals would be needed for each patient . The dialysate has bicarbonate in it to lower the higher acid levels that these patients often have . The blood and dialysate mix together . The waste products are removed from the blood and caught up in the fine membrane .

This article is about taking a bow -LRB- rhymes with â nowâ -RRB- . For using a bow -LRB- rhymes with â noâ -RRB- when playing musical instruments , see bow -LRB- music -RRB- .
Bowing means : taking a bow . A bow is when a person bends their body forward from the waist in order to greet someone or show respect for them . A bow is sometimes not much more than a quick nod of the head , but it can be a very deep bow from the waist . The exact way to bow and the situations in which people bow vary enormously between different cultures .
Bowing was originally a gesture -LRB- a movement of the body -RRB- which showed deep respect for someone . In European cultures bowing to someone is now only done in very formal situations , e.g. when meeting the Queen or someone very high and important .
In European history bowing was common at royal courts . Men were expected to `` bow and scrape '' . This meant bowing and at the same time drawing back the right leg so that it scraped the floor . The man would hold his left hand over his waist while doing this . This is why we still talk about `` bowing and scraping '' meaning that someone is trying very hard and hypocritically to be unnecessarily polite . This kind of deep bow , which is never used nowadays , is sometimes called a â reverenceâ -LRB- a word meaning : â deep respectâ -RRB- .
Bowing was only done by men . Women would always curtsey to show respect .
Nowadays bowing in European cultures is mostly seen at performances . When people applaud -LRB- clap their hands -RRB- after a performance such as a concert on in the theater the performer will take a bow . This is like saying â thank youâ to the audience for saying â thank youâ by clapping . Both men and women performers bow -LRB- although female ballet dancers will curtsey -RRB- .
In Christian worship people in churches will bow to the altar to show respect to Jesus .
There are other special occasions in which people bow . In judo and some other martial arts the two contestants -LRB- people who are going to fight -RRB- will bow to one another to show that they respect one another and will obey the rules of the game .
In some Asian cultures bowing is far more common than in the West . It is especially important in Japan . Japanese people â `` both men and women - spend a lot of their time bowing . They bow to greet one another , to say goodbye , to say they are sorry , to say â thank youâ , or to show that they are not as important as the person they are bowing to . There are different degrees of bowing , and it is very important in Japanese culture to know the right way to bow on different occasions . A bow of 15 degrees is very informal , a bow of 45 degrees is very formal . They keep their back -LRB- from the head to the hips -RRB- straight while doing this . The men have their hands by their sides , women have one hand over the other in front of their body . Typically a bow should last a count of eight : three to go down , one for a pause and four for returning to an upright position . If someone bows a little longer than the other person , that other person may bow again , and the other person then also bows again , and this can go on several times . Japanese mothers carry their babies on their backs , so that children learn to bow even before they can speak . Pupils and teachers at school bow to one another . The more important someone is , the deeper the other person has to bow .

Stalagmites may also refer to a type of fungus .
A stalagmite is a form that can be found on the floor of a cave . It rises from the floor of a limestone cave when mineralized solutions drip from the ceiling and deposits of calcium carbonate form columns on the ground . The corresponding formation on the ceiling of a cave is known as a stalactite .
When touring caves with stalactites and stalagmites you might be asked to not touch the rock formations . This is generally because the formation is considered to still be growing and forming . Since the rock buildup is formed by minerals solidifying out of the water solution , skin oils can disturb where the mineral water will cling . So the development of the rock formation will be affected and not natural anymore .
Stalactites and stalagmites can also form on concrete ceilings and floors , but they form much more rapidly there than in the natural cave environment .
MÃ rignac , Gironde is a commune . It is found in the region Aquitaine in the Gironde department in the southwest of France .
According to the Hebrew Bible , the Ten Commandments were rules for life given by God to the People of Israel on Mount Sinai . The rules were written on stone tablets . The book of Exodus speaks about Mout Sinai , the Book of Deuteronomy about `` Horeb '' . The rules are important for Judaism and Christianity .
Sometimes these rules are also called Decalogue -LRB- from Greek , can be translated as ten statements -RRB- . The name decalogue first occurs in the Septuagint . The Jews received the commandments after they had left Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Ramses . There are different texts talking about the commandments . Most of them are in the Bible : The Book of Exodus , Chapter 20 and the book of Deuteronomy , Chapter 5 . The Qu ` ran also talks about them . Both the Bible and the Qu ` ran have been translated many times . For this reason , there are many variations in the way the commandments are written .
The Bible does not number the commandments . Different religious groups have numbered them in different ways . The Jews , followed by Christian Protestants , end the first commandment with `` You are to have no other gods but me . '' as above . Catholics and Lutherans end the first commandment at `` I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws . '' and separate in their last two commandments the desire for a man 's wife from the desire for other things he owns .
These commandments are translated from Ancient Hebrew to Simple English , so the exact words chosen can not mean to us exactly what they meant to the Hebrews . There is a variety of interpretations of these commandments :
To `` put anyone to death without cause '' , called murder , may mean all killing including execution and war , or exclude these .
To `` be false to the married relation '' , called adultery , is when a married person has sex with a person other than his or her spouse . The Bible does not say this includes unmarried people having sex with each other , although some people think so . Some have interpreted Exodus 22:16 to mean that if two unmarried people have sex , they should make a commitment to one another .
To `` give false witness '' called lying , may include all lying , or only include lying in a court , called perjury .
To `` desire ... your neighbor 's house , or his wife , or his servant or his ox '' , implies that wives and servants were owned by a man in Moses ' time , although this is not so today . Some people say that this means trying to get what the person wants , while others say it means even wanting it .
In the New Testament , Jesus talked about who was guilty of breaking these commandments . He said that even if someone was just angry and rude to another person , they might be judged for murder , and if they just looked with desire or lust at a woman , they had committed adultery in their heart .
The commandments passage in Exodus has more than ten imperative statements , there are 14 or 15 in all . While the Bible itself gives the count as `` 10 '' , using the Hebrew phrase Ê '' aseret had ` varimâ '' translated as the 10 words , statements or things , this phrase does not appear in the passages usually presented as being `` the Ten Commandments '' . Various religions divide the commandments differently . The table below shows those differences .
Muslims reject the Bible 's version of the Ten Commandments . Islam teaches that the Bible is a revelation from God but the text used in Judaism and Christianity has been corrupted . The Ten Commandments are not explicitly mentioned in the Qur ` an but each is implied by the following verses in the Quran -LRB- using Jewish numbering -RRB- :
In general , religions other than those mentioned -LRB- Judaism , Christianity , Islam -RRB- do not recognize the Ten Commandments as ethical standards . Many of them -LRB- Buddhism , Hinduism , Jainism , etc. -RRB- have similar laws or principles though . In the atheist Soviet Union the Moral Code of the Builder of Communism was a set of rules that resembled the Ten Commandments .
Most Christians believe that Sunday is a special day of worship and rest . It is there to remember the Resurrection of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar . They say that there is an analogy between the obligation of the Christian day of worship and the Sabbath-day ordinance . These two rules are not literally identical though . They say that this ordinance is no longer valid , because God has replaced his old creation by a new one . For this reason , the obligation to keep the Sabbath is not the same for Christians as for Jews . They say there are examples in the New Testament , and in other writings surviving from the first few centuries .
Some conservative Christians are `` Sabbatarians '' . Most of these follow the Reformed traditions . Sabbatarians think the first day of the week or Lord 's Day is the new Sabbath . This is because the 4th commandment has never been revoked and Sabbath-keeping is in any case a creation ordinance .
Still others believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on the Saturday , reserving Sunday as a day of worship . In reference to Acts 20:7 , the disciples came together on the first day of the week -LRB- Sunday -RRB- to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul . This is not the first time Christians assembled together on a Sunday ; Jesus appeared to the Christians on the `` first day of the week '' while they were in hiding . One can maintain this argument in that Jesus himself maintained the Sabbath , although not within the restrictions that were mandated by Jewish traditions ; the Pharisees often tried Jesus by asking him if certain tasks were acceptable according to the Law -LRB- see : Luke 14:5 -RRB- . This would seem to show that while the Sabbath was still of importance to the Jews , Sunday was a separate day for worship and teaching from Scriptures .
The Seventh-day Adventists and other churches disagree with some of these views . They argue that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in paganism , specifically Sol Invictus and Mithraism -LRB- in which sun-god worship took place on Sunday -RRB- . This is therefore an explicit rejection of the commandment to keep the seventh day holy . Instead , they keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to God 's work of creation believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed . Seventh-day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the 2nd and 3rd century , by most until the 4th and 5th century , and a few thereafter , but because of opposition to Judaism after the Jewish-Roman wars , the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship . The history of these changes is certainly not altogether lost regardless of any belief in a suppression of the facts by a conspiracy of the pagans of the Roman Empire and the clergy of the Catholic Church . See Great Apostasy .
Jews had come to be hated in the Roman Empire after the Jewish-Roman wars . This led to the criminalization of the Jewish Sabbath . Hatred of Jews is apparent in the Council of Laodicea -LRB- 4th Century AD -RRB- where Canon 37 â `` 38 states : `` It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics , nor to feast together with them . '' and `` It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews , nor to be partakers of their impiety . '' In keeping with this rejection of the Jews , this Roman council also criminalized the Jewish Sabbath as can be seen in Canon 29 of the Council Laodicea : `` Christians must not Judaize by resting on the Sabbath , but must work on that day , rather honoring the Lord 's Day ; and , if they can , resting then as Christians . But if any shall be found to be judaizers , let them be anathema -LRB- excommunicated -RRB- from Christ . ''
Various translations exist of the sixth commandment ; the Hebrew words -- are translated either as `` thou shalt not kill '' or `` thou shalt not murder '' . Older Protestant translations of the Bible , those based on the Vulgate and Roman Catholic translations usually translate it `` Thou shalt not kill '' . Jewish and newer Protestant versions tend to use `` You shall not murder '' . There is controversy as to which translation is more faithful , and both forms are quoted in support of ethical standpoints .
The Vulgate -LRB- Latin -RRB- translation has Non occides , i.e. `` Thou shalt not kill '' . English translations using `` kill '' include the King James -LRB- Authorised -RRB- -LRB- 1611 -RRB- -LRB- although note Matthew `` do no murder '' , following the Vulgate non homicidium facies -RRB- , the American Standard -LRB- 1901 -RRB- and Revised Standard -LRB- American Protestant , 1952 -RRB- Versions . Almost all Roman Catholic translations , including the Douay-Rheims Bible -LRB- 1609\/1752 -RRB- , the New American Bible -LRB- 1970 -RRB- , the New Jerusalem Bible -LRB- 1985 -RRB- and the Christian Community Bible -LRB- 1986 -RRB- , have `` kill '' . Martin Luther -LRB- German , 1534 -RRB- also uses tÃ ten -LRB- kill -RRB- .
Protestant translations using `` murder '' include the New International Version -LRB- American , 1978 -RRB- , New American Standard Bible -LRB- American , 1971 -RRB- , New English Bible -LRB- British Protestant , 1970 -RRB- , and the New King James -LRB- American , 1982 -RRB- , New Revised Standard -LRB- American , 1989 -RRB- and English Standard -LRB- American Protestant , 2001 -RRB- Versions . Jewish translations almost all use `` murder '' , including the Jewish Publication Society of America Version -LRB- 1917 -RRB- , the Judaica Press tanach -LRB- 1963 -RRB- and the Living Torah -LRB- 1981 -RRB- . A Jewish exception is the Artscroll or Stone Edition tanach -LRB- 1996 -RRB- .
The many examples in the Old Testament of killing sanctioned by God , are quoted in defense of the view that `` murder '' is more accurate . Furthermore , the Hebrew word for `` kill '' is '' '' ' '' - `` harog '' , while the Hebrew word for `` murder '' is '' -- '' - `` retzach '' , which is found in the Ten Commandments '' -- '' - `` lo tirtzach '' .
Many academic theologians -LRB- such as German Old Testament scholar A. Alt : Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog -LRB- 1953 -RRB- -RRB- suggest that commandment `` you shall not steal '' was originally intended against stealing people â '' against abductions and slavery . This would be the same as the Jewish interpretation of the statement as `` you shall not kidnap '' -LRB- e.g. as stated by Rashi -RRB- .
Many Christians say that a very important element of the commandment not to make `` any image , or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above '' is `` and bow down and worship it '' . One understanding on this comes from Roman Catholicism : they hold that `` likenesses '' may be built and used , as long as the object is not worshipped . As a result , many Roman Catholic churches and services feature images or statues . The Eastern Orthodox Church has a very similar position . As a consequence , icons are venerated in some Eastern Orthodox services . Most Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox understand this practice as fulfilling the observance of the commandment . In their understanding , these images are not being worshipped .
Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that the incarnation of an invisible God as a visible human , Jesus , makes it permissible and necessary to venerate icons .
For Jews and Muslims , veneration violates this commandment . Jews and Muslims read this commandment as prohibiting the use of idols and images in any way .
Some Protestants will allow pictures Jesus in his human form , while refusing to make any image of God or Jesus in Heaven .
Very few Christians oppose the making of any images at all . Some groups have been critical of the use others make of images in worship . -LRB- See iconoclasm . -RRB- In particular , the Orthodox have criticized the Roman Catholic use of decorative statues , Roman Catholics have criticized the Orthodox veneration of icons , and some Protestant groups have criticized the use of stained-glass windows by other denominations . Jehovah 's Witnesses criticize the use of all of the above , as well as the use of the cross . Amish people forbid any sort of graven image , such as photos .
The term `` Ten Commandments '' without a modifier generally applies to the lists mentioned in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 . However , there is a continuous story being told starting in Exodus 31:18 -LRB- where the stones are created -RRB- , Exodus 32:19 -LRB- where the tablets are broken -RRB- and Exodus 34 . This story lists a very different set of commandments . This version is sometimes called `` Ritual Decalogue '' . Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and the people after him who followed the documentary hypothesis , note that Exodus 34:28 seems to refer to these Ten Commandments rather than the traditional ones . These people thought that the commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 show a later set of Ten Commandments , and that the ten listed in Exodus 34 were the original Ten Commandments , now known as the Ritual Decalogue -LRB- as opposed to the better-known `` Ethical Decalogue '' -RRB- . The differences between the two Decalogues highlight the development of sacred texts over a long time and from differing narrative traditions by incorporating two differing sets of Ten Commandments .
The commandments have influenced Jewish ethics and law and , through Judaism and Christianity , Western ethics and law since the Roman Empire .

D. B. Cooper -LRB- also known as Dan Cooper -RRB- is an alias -LRB- false name -RRB- for a man who hijacked an airplane in 1971 . He received the ransom payment of 200,000 Dollars . He jumped from the plane , a Boeing 727 that was traveling in the Pacific Northwest of the United States , possibly over Woodland , Washington . Hundreds of suspects have been named through the years , but no conclusive evidence has surfaced regarding who Cooper was , or where he lived . The FBI believes he did not survive the jump . Several people have tried to explain what happened after the jump . Some of these explanations contradict each other .
Because no one expected he would jump and because little is known of what happened afterwards , people are still interested in the case . The Cooper case -LRB- code-named `` Norjak '' by the FBI -RRB- remains an unsolved mystery .
The case is famous for its enduring lack of evidence . A few significant clues have arisen , nevertheless . In late 1978 , a placard , which contained instructions on how to lower the rear stairs of a 727 was found just a few flying minutes north of Cooper 's projected drop zone .

A quasar -LRB- or Quasi-Stellar Radio Source -RRB- occurs when gas near a black hole goes into the black hole -LRB- at very high speed -RRB- . When the gas gets close to the black hole , the gas heats up because of friction . Therefore , the gas glows very brightly , and this light is visible on the other side of the Universe . It is often brighter than the whole galaxy that quasar is in . The first quasars were discovered with radio telescopes in the late 1950s and are still actively studied by astronomers today .
Astronomers now think that when a galaxy has a quasar , the quasar changes the galaxy . Gas and dust from the galaxy falls onto the quasar , and the bright quasar heats up gas in the galaxy . This stops new stars from forming in the galaxy , so many of the elliptical galaxies we see in the universe now may have once had a quasar in their centers . When the gas and dust stop falling onto the quasar , it stops being so bright and the black hole becomes very hard to see .

In the Euclidean space R3 is called orientable if a two-dimensional figure -LRB- for example , -RRB- can not be moved around the surface and back to where it started so that it looks like its own mirror image . Otherwise the surface is non-orientable . A concept connected to this is chirality . This means that no matter what , a human right hand , can not be rotated in such a way that it becomes a human left hand . The right hand is therefore orientable .

A flagellum -LRB- plural : flagella -RRB- is a long , whip-like projection of a cell composed of microtubules . They help propel cells and organisms in a whip-like motion . The flagellum of eukaryotes usually moves with an â Sâ motion , and is surrounded by cell membrane .
Flagella are structurally almost identical with the much smaller Cilia . So much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the Phylum Undulipodia . Previously , Margulis had proposed that the Ciliates alone should be placed in a Phylum Ciliophora . Admittedly , the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms , but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux -LRB- changing -RRB- , Protista is still a useful term .
Cilia and flagella are cell organelles , specialised units which carry out well-defined functions , like mitochondria and plastids . It is fairly clear now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent prokaryotes -LRB- bacteria or archaea -RRB- , and that the eukaryote cell is a ` community of micro-organisms ' working together in ' a marriage of convenience ' .
Three types of flagella have so far been distinguished ; bacterial , archaeal and eukaryotic . The main differences among these three types are summarized below :

Wikipedia 's goal is to collect all human knowledge . Because of this , Wikipedia contains millions of articles on a wide range of subjects . A few of these subjects are frequently censored by educational , governmental , corporate , parental and other filtering schemes .
Wikipedia 's current policy is to include such content , as long as it does not break any of our policies -LRB- especially Neutral point of view -RRB- nor the laws of the state of Florida in the United States , where Wikipedia is hosted . See a list of controversial issues for some examples of articles that may contain such content . Some of these articles contain warnings , but many do not .
In any case , Wikipedia is a work in progress , and many articles contain errors , bias , duplication , or simply need tender loving care . We encourage readers to help us fix these problems . Most of our articles are written by people who are not subject matter experts , and may lack academic or professional credentials in the area .
Wikipedia contains obscure information that would not be covered in a conventional encyclopedia . Wikipedia 's coverage of subjects is patchy , based on the whims of its volunteer contributors -LRB- in particular , subjects of interest to young technical people are likely , but not certain , to receive heavier coverage than other subjects -RRB- . Readers should not judge the importance of topics based on their coverage in Wikipedia , nor assume that a topic is important merely because it is the subject of a Wikipedia article .

N factorial -LRB- written N ! -RRB- is the number we get when we multiply every number from 1 to N. If N is 0 , N factorial is 1 . N ! is not defined for negative numbers .
It is used to find out how many possibilities there are to arrange objects .
For example , if there are 3 letters -LRB- A , B , and C -RRB- , they can be arranged as ABC , ACB , BAC , BCA , CAB , and CBA . That 's 6 choices because A can be put in 3 different places , B has 2 choices left after A is placed , and C has only one choice left after A and B have been placed . That is 3 Ã -- 2 Ã -- 1 = 6 choices .
More generally , if there are three objects , and we want to find out how many different ways there are to arrange -LRB- or select them -RRB- , than for the first object , there are 3 choices . For the second object , there are only two choices left as the first object has already been chosen . And finally , for the third object , there is only one object left .
Therefore 3 ! is equivalent to 3 Ã -- 2 Ã -- 1 , or 6 .
This function is a good example of recursion -LRB- doing things again and again -RRB- , as 3 ! can be written as 3 Ã -- -LRB- 2 ! -RRB- , which can be written as 3 Ã -- 2 Ã -- -LRB- 1 ! -RRB- and finally 3 Ã -- 2 Ã -- 1 Ã -- -LRB- 0 ! -RRB- . N ! can therefore also be defined as NÃ -- -LRB- N-1 -RRB- ! with 0 ! = 1 .
The factorial function grows very fast . There are 3,628,800 ways to arrange 10 items .

ParanÃ is a state in Southern Brazil , bordering Paraguay and Argentina . Its capital is Curitiba - the largest city in the south of the country - and it is a famous state because of Itaipu Dam and the IguaÃ u Falls .
ParanÃ is bounded on the north by SÃ # o Paulo , on the east by the Atlantic Ocean , on the south by Santa Catarina and the Misiones Province of Argentina , and on the west by Mato Grosso do Sul and the republic of Paraguay , with the ParanÃ River as its western boundary line .
ParanÃ is one of the Brazilian states that shows the most signs of recent European colonization . Most of the population are descendants of European settlers , and is one of the most ethnically diverse . Waves of European immigrants started arriving after 1850 , mainly Germans , Italians , Poles and Ukrainians . The development of the state is closely linked to the arrival of the immigrants . Nowadays , migrants from other Brazilian states -LRB- especially from the SÃ # o Paulo , Santa Catarina , Rio Grande do Sul and the Northeast Region -RRB- come to ParanÃ in search of a better life .
People of Polish descent predominate in the central and south regions , mainly around Curitiba . Italians predominate in the capital , Curitiba , and in the coast . People of Ukrainian descent predominate in a few cities , such as PrudentÃ polis ; many Ukrainians are found throughout the state . Germans predominate in a few cities , such as RolÃ cents ndia .

An aircraft is a flying machine . There are many different kinds of aircraft .
Some aircraft keep in the sky by moving air over their wings . Examples are aeroplanes , helicopters , and gliders . Some aircraft keep in the sky by floating . Examples are balloons and airships .
Most aircraft use engine power . Examples are aeroplanes , helicopters , and airships . A few aircraft use no power . Examples are gliders and balloons . A few aircraft use muscle power .
Big aeroplanes for transporting people are called airliners . Airliners fly at more than 850 km\/h -LRB- 530 mph -RRB- . Less than 100 years ago , the quickest ships needed more than seven days to travel across the Atlantic Ocean because it is 4,800 km -LRB- 3,000 miles -RRB- wide . Now airliners need less than seven hours to travel across the Atlantic Ocean . Airliners are the quickest way to travel . Airliners can fly over mountains and bad weather . Airliners have complex technology to make them fly quickly , safely , and for less money .
Fighting aircraft fly at 3,200 km\/h -LRB- 2,000 mph -RRB- .

A symphonic poem or tone poem is a piece of orchestral music which has a story attached to it or describes something such as poem or a painting or any idea which is not music . A symphonic poem is a kind of program music -LRB- music for instruments which has an idea outside music -RRB- .
Symphonic poems were mostly written in the 19th century at the time known as the Romantic period . They are normally in one movement lasting perhaps between 10 and 20 minutes . Some of the longest ones , such as Ein Heldenleben by Richard Strauss are much longer , like a symphony with four movements which run into one another .
The idea can be seen in Beethovenâ s overtures which tell the story of the opera or play which is about to be performed . Composers such as Felix Mendelssohn then started to write overtures which told a story but were not attached to any opera . Fingal 's Cave -LRB- 1832 -RRB- describes the sea lapping against the rocks of a cave in the Scottish Hebrides .
Franz Liszt was the composer who made the symphonic poem an important musical form . He wrote twelve works which he called Symphonische Dichtung -LRB- Symphonic poem -RRB- because the music developed in the same way as in a symphony . One example is Mazeppa -LRB- 1851 -RRB- which describes the poem by Victor Hugo about a wild horse that carries a man tied to his mane until he is rescued by the Ukrainians and made into their chief .
Other composers who wrote symphonic poems include Sergei Rachmaninoff , Modest Mussorgsky , Camille Saint-Sa Ã `` ns , Claude Debussy , Jean Sibelius , BedÅ ich Smetana , AntonÃ n DvoÅ Ã k , Pyotr Tchaikovsky and CÃ sar Franck .

Dreams are the things that happen in a person 's mind while they are sleeping . They are often similar to real life in some ways , but can also be very strange . Dreams can seem so real while they happen that the person might think that they are awake when actually they are asleep .
Sometimes a person realizes during a dream that they are dreaming , but keeps having the dream . This is called a lucid dream . This happens very little for most people , but for some people it happens often . During lucid dreaming the person will feel like they are controlling the dream , and will usually dream that they are doing fun things that they ca n't do in the real world .
Most people remember their dreams in some way or another , even if it 's only a small part , but children are very likely to remember most of their dream clearly . It 's often easier for people to remember dreams if they write down what happened in the dream just after they wake up . Because of this , many people have dream diaries where they describe each dream they have .
Nightmares are dreams which scare or shock people . Nightmares are usually based around that person 's everyday fears , like spiders or dark places , but even a dream that 's not about those things can feel unpleasant . Nightmares are caused by many different things : being uncomfortable or in pain while sleeping , sickness , stress , or even eating right before sleeping .
There are many different theories about why people dream and what their dreams mean . Every person has different dreams . Some psychologists believe that dreams reflect what is happening in the unconscious mind -LRB- the part of the mind that works by itself -RRB- . Others think that people , places , and objects in dreams are symbols for other things in the dreamer 's real life . Throughout history people have tried to make sense of dreams to learn things from them , and have often used them for divination or fortune-telling . Today there are still many books and websites devoted to making sense of dreams .

This article is about the fictional characters from InuYasha , an anime and manga series written by Rumiko Takahashi .
Inuyasha is the main protagonist of the series . He is a half-demon -LRB- `` han ` yÅ '' in Japanese -RRB- . His father was a great demon general and the ruler of the western lands , his mother was a human princess who went against social standards and bore a demons child . His father died the day he was born , protecting his mother and his mother later dies when he is a small child -LRB- most likely under the age of ten , although it is never really explained -RRB- . He uses a weapon called the Tetsusaiga , which is a sword made from his father 's fang , it can kill a hundred demons in a single swing . On the new moon his demon blood wanes and he becomes human for one night .
Fifty years before the start of the anime , Inuyasha meets a priestess by the name of Kikyo , while searching for the legendary Shikon no Toma . He wants to jewel to become a full demon , so he can become strong . Kikyo is the keeper of the jewel and a fair match for Inuyasha , he is never able to get the jewel from her . The two form a strange relationship with each other because they are both outcasts because of their individual lots in life . They fall in love with each other and Kikyo ask Inuyasha to become a human for two reasons . First , so she and Inuyasha can be together unhindered by social constraints and second because she believes it will purify the Shikon no Toma , ending her obligation to protect the jewel . Inuyasha reluctantly agrees because he wants to live a normal life .
Unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it , a demon named Naraku foils their plan turning them against each other . He first attacks Kikyo , using Inuyasha image and then attacks Inuyasha using Kikyo 's image . Inuyasha , thinking Kikyo has betrayed him , steals the jewel and flees the village . Kikyo , thinking Inuyasha has betrayed her , follows him and pins him to Goshinbock using a sealing arrow . She dies soon after .
Fifty years later , Inuyasha awakens on the tree to the sight of Kagome , Kikyo 's reincarnation . Together they hunt for the Shikon no Toma shards , after Kagome shatters the jewel . At first Inuyasha hates Kagome because of her resemblance to Kikyo but eventually grows to love her very deeply -LRB- some argue more deeply than he ever loved Kikyo -RRB- . Slowly , Kagome teaches him to embrace his heritage and slowly heals the wounds that have been inflicted on his heart by Kikyo , Naraku , and the hardness of his life . At the end of the anime he makes this very clear , when he announces that Kagome was born to heal him and he was born to protect Kagome .
At the end of the anime Inuyasha is shown to have grown into a very wise character . He is no longer angry and jealous but instead wise and understanding because of all that Kagome has taught him . This is especially seen when he decides to let Kagome go back to her own time , instead of staying with him because he knows that Kagome 's family needs her more than he does , although this decision seems to greatly depress him .
Three years later after graduating from high school , Kagome 's longing to be with Inuyasha causes the well to open once again and she is allowed to return to the past permanently -LRB- much to Inuyasha 's great relief -RRB- . In the last scene of the anime , it is implied , that her and Inuyasha marry when she calls Sesshoumaru -LRB- Inuyasha 's brother -RRB- her brother-in-law .
Kagome Higurashi is the narrator and the second protagonist of the series . She is often believed to be the protagonist because she is the narrator throughout most episodes and in the movies . Kagome is a fifteen year old middle school student , who lives in the Sunset shrine in 20th century Tokyo , Japan .
On her fifteenth liquid fart , Kagome is dragged down her families well by a demon -LRB- Mistress Centipede in English -RRB- after attempting to rescue the family cat . She arrives in 15th century Japan soon after . At this time she sees Inuyasha for the first time , pinned to Goshinbock -LRB- The God 's Tree in the English version -RRB- . Upon seeing him , she ` tweaks ' his ears , only to find herself surrounded by angry villagers who are scared by her strange ` modern ' clothes . They take her to Kaede the village Miko -LRB- priestess -RRB- . Kaede , upon seeing Kagome , realizes that Kagome is the reincarnation of her older sister , Kikyo , the original protector of the Shikon no Toma . Shortly after , Mistress Centipede attacks the village . Kagome knows that the demon is after her and decides to flea so the demon will leave the innocent villagers alone . She ends up at Goshinbock where Inuyasha -LRB- for reasons never explained -RRB- has awakened .
At this time , one of the most iconic moments of the anime happens . Inuyasha , who does not realize he has been on the tree for fifty years calls Kagome , Kikyo and insults her . Kagome retaliates by yelling at him and explaining that her name is KA-GO-ME . Mistress Centipede reaches them and grabs Kagome at the hip , ripping the Shikon no Toma from her side before she wraps herself around the tree , crushing Kagome to Inuyasha . Inuyasha convinces Kagome to remove the arrow from his chest so he can kill the demon . Kagome obeys and he is freed . He kills the demon and then turns on Kagome , wanting the jewel for himself . Kaede seeing the problem , decides to put a rosary around Inuyasha 's neck . She farts that sends to rosary out and it goes around Inuyasha neck permanently . She then tells Kagome to say a command word , the only word Kagome can think of it ` sit ' because he looks like a dog . Upon saying the word , Inuyasha is slammed into the ground and the greatest love hate relationship ever is born .
Kagome learns that Inuyasha wants the jewel to become a full demon . Unfortunantly , Kagome in her clumsy nature shatters the jewel only an episode later and it is decided that she and Inuyasha will team up to find the Shikon Shards for two reasons . First , because she is the only one who can ` see ' them and second because she needs someone strong to protect her during the process . This causes Kagome to lead a double life , Shard detector in the past and middle school student in the present .
Throughout the anime Inuyasha and Kagome met many people , demon , half demon -LRB- hanyou -RRB- , and human . They make many friends and learn much in the process , getting closer with each episode . By the end of the anime Inuyasha and Kagome are very much in love with one another despite many road blocks such as Kikyo , Kagome 's incarnation and Inuyasha 's first love , being brought back to ` life ' . Kikyo eventually returns to the after life and Inuyasha is free to love Kagome completely .
At the end of the liqud fart Inuyasha and Kagome are separated after Naraku is defeated , Inuyasha staying in the past and Kagome returning to her own time . Three years pass in which Kagome attends and graduates from High School . After her graduation , she returns to the well in her families shrine and wishes to see Inuyasha again . The well opens and with her mother 's blessing she returns to the past and she returns to Inuyasha , permanently .
Although it is not officially said , it is implied that Inuyasha and Kagome are married in the very last scene of the anime , when Kagome looks at Sesshoumaru -LRB- Inuyasha 's brother -RRB- and plainly calls him her brother-in-law .
Miroku is the second character to join Inuyasha and Kagome in the quest to defeat Naraku and purify the Shikon no Tama . He is a monk who has an unhealthy habit of groping women , especially Sango , another predominant character in the anime . Miroku carries on a curse that was originally placed on his grandfather by the demon , Naraku . The curse itself looks like a black void located in the palm of his hand . In the English version it is called the Wind Tunnel or Air Void -LRB- Kazana in the Japanese version -RRB- and can suck anything inside of it , making it Miroku 's greatest weapon but also his greatest threat . One day the Wind Tunnel will suck Miroku into it as well as it did to his father and his grandfather .
Because of this Miroku needs a male heir to carry on his family name should he die . Therefore , he is always asking women to `` bear his child , '' in hopes of gaining this male heir . This becomes a chronic joke in the anime , almost always ending with Miroku groping a girl -LRB- mainly Sango -RRB- , asking said girl -LRB- mainly Sango -RRB- to bear his child , and then getting slapped hard in the face by said girl -LRB- mainly Sango -RRB- . As the anime progresses Miroku becomes a much deeper character and is shown to be a man longing for love and a family , which he eventually finds in Sango after the defeat of Naraku . At this time Miroku and Sango marry and have three children , twin girls and a boy .
Sango is the third and last character to join Inuyasha and Kagome in the quest to defeat Naraku and purify the Shikon no Toma . She is a demon slayer or a yokai tajiya as she is dubbed in the Japanese version of the anime . At one time she lived with her father and brother in a demon exterminator village . This particular village is also the location of the Shikon no Toma 's birth and it is suggested that Sango 's Grandfather was the one who entrusted the jewel to Kikyo fifty years ago .
In episode 24 , Sango first encounters Naraku on a mission to exterminate a demon at a near by Castle . Her brother , Kohaku , is sent to help her defeat the demon -LRB- it is his first demon exterminating job -RRB- . Naraku disguised as the Castle 's Lord , takes control of the young and vulnerable Kohaku and uses him to kill all of the demon exterminators and his sister , Sango . He nearly succeeds but comes back to his senses . Naraku then orders the Castle guards to kill the pair . They are both shot in the back with arrows . Sango manages to live but is badly hurt and under the impression that her brother has died as well as her whole family . Meanwhile , Naraku destroys Sango 's village and disguised as the Lord of the Castle tells her that Inuyasha was the one who attacked it and killed her family . Even though she is badly injuried Sango wants revenge and decides to go after Inuyasha , just as Naraku had planed she would .
Upon fighting Inuyasha , however , Sango learns that he is not bad just because he is a demon and that he did not in fact kill the people of her village . Inuyasha , in his blunt and rash way , helps her to heal and convinces her to live to defeat Naraku . She then swears revenge on Naraku and decides to join the group , along with her pet cat demon , Kirara . Eventually , she finds out Kohaku is alive but under the control of Naraku . She vows to get her brother back and spends the majority of the anime trying to save him , often not succeeding but living with the support of the group -LRB- especially with Miroku 's support -RRB- .
By the end , she saves Kohaku and marries Miroku , her love interest throughout the anime . They have three children , twin girls and a boy .
Shippo is the first character to join Inuyasha and Kagome in the quest to defeat Naraku and purify the Shikon no Toma . He is an adolescent fox demon or kitsune youkai as he is refereed to in the Japanese version of the anime . Although Shippo 's age is never mentioned he appears approximately five years old .
He meets Kagome and Inuyasha when he attempts to steal their Shikon Shards with a fox illusion that Inuyasha easily sees through . Shippo explains to them that his mother and father are dead , his father having been very recently killed by the Thunder Brothers , Hiten and Manten . Hiten , the older of the Thunder Brothers possesses Shikon shards . Therefore , Shippo believes that in order to get revenge he needs Shikon Shards of his own , so he can be strong . Eventually , Shippo succeeds in stealing the Shikon shards by tricking Inuyasha . Inadvertently , this causes Kagome to be kidnapped soon after by the Thunder Brothers , which in turn causes Inuyasha to come save them . Inuyasha eventually beats the Thunder Brothers , gaining their Shikon Shards in the process , and begrudgingly allows Shippo into the group .
Kagome treats him with motherly affection , and often brings him crayons and candy from her time as well as allowing him to bath with her and sleep with her . Inuyasha treats him badly most of the time , claiming the small child annoying . Many fans see this as a sign of jealousy because Inuyasha does not like the attention Kagome pays to Shippo instead of himself . The other central characters all seem to treat Shippo as a son or younger brother , often teaching him life lessons or coddling him .
Kirara is Sango 's pet cat demon or neko yokai as she is refered to in the Japanese version . She appears to be a small , almost kitten sized cat the majority of the time but when provoked or ready for battle she transforms into a very large , lion sized cat . She is a very loyal demon , who was originally owned by Midoriko , the creator of the Shikon no Toma .
She is exceptionally clever and is much more intelligent than a simple cat . She is an asset in battle because of her ability to fly . It is sometimes implied that Inuyasha can understand Kirara to a degree , although the creator of the anime does not seem to spend much time explaining demon 's ability to connect with animals . Although it is shown that Sesshoumaru , Inuyasha 's older brother , can in fact talk to dogs and Kouga , a wolf demon in the series , can in fact talk to wolves , their respective animal counterparts .
Kirara and Shippo seem to have a strong connection , perhaps because they are of a very similar size . Often times , the two are shown together and when Shippo is not sleeping with Kagome , he is usually seen with Kirara .
Naraku is the main antagonist of the series . He is an evil demon made by Onigumo , who loved Kikyo . When Onigumo became jealous of Inuyasha , he made many demons , led by a spider demon , come to him with his impure -LRB- bad -RRB- mind of jealousy . This is because demons like bad minds . The spider demon tells Onigumo that if Onigumo wants revenge on Inuyasha , he has to let the demons eat his soul and join with him to fight off Inuyasha . When Onigumo agrees , Naraku is created . Naraku has a heart made out of Onigumo 's soul , which still loves Kikyo . But Naraku is evil because many demons joined him , just like the demons made by Midoriko 's lover , and kills Kikyo while pretending to be Inuyasha . This is so that Kikyo would think the real Inuyasha killed her . Naraku did this to get the shikon no tama for himself , and did not want Kikyo to hand it to Inuyasha .
Kikyo seals Inuyasha because of this , when Inuyasha runs away with the shikon no tama because Naraku also turned into Kikyo to say things to hurt Inuyasha , who thought it was the real Kikyo . Thinking that Kikyo would n't give him the shikon no tama as promised , he steals it . Kikyo thinks then that Inuyasha is betraying her so she shoots an arrow at him .
Nobody knows about Naraku until episode 15 , where Miroku tells Inuyasha and Kagome about a demon who gave a curse called Wind Tunnel on him . Naraku really gave the curse to Miroku 's grandfather , who thought Naraku was a real woman since Naraku turned into a woman to fool the grandfather . The curse has to go on until they win against Naraku . This is how Miroku joins in .
Naraku also tells the other demons in episode 24 to attack a village where no demon slayer are left , because Naraku controlled Kohaku , a demon slayer , to kill the rest of the slayers . Sango , Kohaku 's sister , who is still alive tries to kill Naraku who attacked her village . This is how Sango joins in .
Basically , Naraku is the reason why everyone met each other ... they are also planning to kill him as well as finding the shikon no tama that broke into pieces . Naraku is also trying to gather the pieces so that he can become a full demon , because he 's a half-demon and half-human since with Onigumo , a human , joined with demons .
As well as being able to change into different people , Naraku can also make parts of his body come apart -LRB- detach -RRB- from him . They are usually called his detachments or incarnations . He made many of them including Kagura , Hakudoshi , Akago and Musou . Akago and Musou were to make himself not like Kikyo anymore because of Onigumo .
Kaede is Kikyo 's stubborn -LRB- she never changes her mind -RRB- sister , who lived for 50 years after Kikyo died and meets Kagome . She is the one who found out that Kagome was her sister Kikyo 's reincarnation , and tells Inuyasha and Kagome to work together , because Kagome also has the priestess powers that Kikyo once had . She tells both of them that Kagome can see the Shikon no Tama unlike other people , and because Inuyasha can not see the jewel but is strong enough to fight for it , they can work together . She loves her sister more than anything . She wishes that Kikyo 's soul would rest in peace , from the day when Kikyo came alive again as a doll , because of Urasue .
Kikyo was a girl priest , also called priestess or miko . She was cursed to die if she loved someone . She did not think she was a normal person because of her priestess powers -LRB- spiritiual powers -RRB- . She thought that she did not belong anywhere normal . InuYasha , a half-demon , and half-human also did not belong on any side and wanted to become a full demon , just like Kikyo wanting to become normal . This is why Kikyo felt the same as Inuyasha . Because of this they came to love each other . After they both loved each other , Kikyo promises to Inuyasha that she will give him shikon no tama , which she has to look after -LRB- which she also is a priestess for -RRB- , if Inuyasha uses it to become a full human instead of a full demon . This would make Kikyo normal again , because she 's not a priestess any more and Inuyasha is also normal , human husband .
Naraku , an evil demon made by Onigumo , loved Kikyo and was jealous of InuYasha . Naraku could change his shape into different people . He wanted the jewel that Kikyo had , the Shikon no Tama . The jewel would free him from Onigumo 's orders -LRB- heart -RRB- telling him not to kill Kikyo . In the beginning of story , Naraku turned into Inuyasha and talked to Kikyo . Next , he turned Kikyo and talked to InuYasha . He said things that hurt them . He did this to make them hate each other . Kikyo nearly died because Naraku turned into Inuyasha and attacked her .
Urasue , a doll-maker , made a clay doll that looked just like Kikyo . She made it to give Kikyo half the soul of Kagome , Kikyo 's reincarnation . Kikyo and the doll are the same people so the doll-Kikyo would have the same soul . Kikyo killed Urasue and ran away from Kagome . She had found out that Kagome would control the soul inside her so that it might go back inside Kagome . She hates Inuyasha too , because before she died , she hated him . She became jealous of Kagome because of Inuyasha liking both her and Kikyo but she got over it soon . Kagome was still jealous of Kikyo - even though they are the same person .
Only in the manga , Kikyo dies because she did not go well on destroying Naraku . She tried to kill him by using her arrows to purify -LRB- make it good -RRB- the finished , whole Shikon no Tama when it was with Naraku , because Naraku could not win over pure -LRB- good -RRB- things and the jewel , when it was complete , would be make the purity even more powerful with its own power . Kikyo hoped that the side of Naraku 's soul would win over the evil , demons ' souls inside the jewel , but Naraku was too strong for the goodness . He attacked Kikyo with his badness , because he did not have a heart that loved her any more and Kikyo 's messed up goodness of her heart made her spiritual powers go away . This is why she died .
This episode ends with Kikyo dying after Inuyasha kisses her . She wishes that Kagome would not cry , because she is happy since her soul can rest from living a doll-like life . But Kagome does cry . Sango is also sad because she knew that Kikyo cared for Kohaku , her brother , and would do anything if she could not kill him .
Kohaku is Sango 's brother . He was a boy who used to never like fighting , but when he finally becomes a demon slayer , he is controlled by a spider demon , to kill his own family . Kohaku also dies because of the castle lord 's soldiers attacking him for madness . Only his sister Sango did not die , and tries to revenge on Naraku for planning this to happen .
Kohaku is alive even so , because Naraku uses a piece from the Shikon no Tama on his back . The jewel 's power made him alive again . But all his memories are gone , and he can only listen to whatever Naraku tells him to do . He also does not remember Sango , who is happy to see that he is alive . But Sango is sad to find his brother killing more people because of Naraku ordering him to . Sango 's new aim is to also save Kohaku from Naraku 's control .
Midoriko was a priestess who was so strong that she was the same as 100 of Japanese soldiers called Samurais . She had 4 pure -LRB- good -RRB- souls inside her : Aramitama -LRB- Courage -RRB- , Nigimitama -LRB- Friendship -RRB- , Kushimitama -LRB- Wisdom -RRB- and Sakimitama -LRB- Love -RRB- . The souls could make a person very powerful which was why she was so .
One day , a human who loved her was jealous , just like Onigumo . He made demons eat his soul so that they could all join together . But the number of demons were so much that the human lost his love and the demons were able to fight Midoriko without any struggle . Because there were so many of them joined together , with so much impurity -LRB- bad powers -RRB- , even with Midoriko 's own power of goodness and purity , they could easily win over Midoriko . But when they were about to eat her , she tore out her own 4 pure -LRB- good -RRB- souls and joined it with the demon 's bad soul . This made the demons die and made the Shikon no Tama . But Midoriko also died because of this , together with the demons .
There was a statue of her in a cave in Sango 's village where Shako , Sango 's grandfather found the Shikon no Tama for the first time and gave it to Kikyo to look after .
Kirara is Sango 's pet demon . She was also Shako 's pet . In the anime , Kirara is also known to be Midoriko 's pet . Kirara was not Midoriko 's pet in the manga .
Onigumo is a human who was once a thief . He got beaten and was nearly killed when Kikyo came to save him in a cave . This is how Onigumo comes to love Kikyo , but he is soon jealous . He is the maker of Naraku and because his soul is still inside Naraku , Naraku can not kill Kikyo with the love for her by Onigumo still inside him . Naraku does not want to love Kikyo , so he tries to tear onigumo apart . Naraku 's trying is shown by Musou , his detachment , who failed . But he finally manges it by tearing his heart , as a little child called Akago and nearly kills her with tentacles , but Kikyo gets help from the soils from Onigumo 's cave , where he once used to get treated by Kikyo .
Shako is Sango 's grandfather who used to own Kirara . He could also use Hiraikotsu , which is given to Sango when she is born . He found the Shikon no Tama messed up with impureness -LRB- badness -RRB- because of the bad Mistress Centipede having it . Shako kills Mistress Centipede with his boomerang and puts her bones into the Bone-eater 's well , where bones of dead demons are put inside . This is why Mistress Centipede became alive from her bones and grabbed Kagome inside the well . Shako then gives the jewel to Kikyo , because her goodness will not mess up the jewel any more . But that is why Kikyo has to be a priestess forever , because she has to protect the jewel forever . She did not want to stay being a priestess and wanted to be normal . This is why she agreed to meet Inuyasha and give the jewel to him .
Shako finds the jewel on front of Midoriko 's cave , where there is a barrier . He finds out that only people who has goodness in their hearts and feel sorry for dead soldiers can go inside the cave .
The Thunder Brothers are two brothers , called Hiten and Manten . They killed Shippo 's father to get a piece of the jewel shard . They made themselves a sash with the father 's hide -LRB- a belt to remember killing the father -RRB- . Shippo tries to get revenge on them by getting more power from the Shikon no tama , and tries to steals it from Inuyasha and Kagome , but soon works together with them to kill the Thunder Brothers .

Australopithecus is a genus of extinct hominids closely related to humans .
The first Australopithecus described was the Taung Child , discovered by Raymond Dart , and described in 1925 .
Their remains are mostly found in East Africa , and the first fossil is from 3.9 million years ago -LRB- mya -RRB- . The split from other apes would have taken place earlier , perhaps about 5 mya .
It is widely believed that the group of which they are part gave rise to the genus Homo , and hence to human beings .
The genus Australopithecus originally included two rather different forms . One form was lightweight : the gracile australopithecines . The other form was bulkier , the robust australopithecines .
It is still under discussion whether they should be put in separate genera . Here we treat the gracile forms ; the robust forms are described elsewhere as Paranthropus .
Gracile australopithecines shared several traits with modern apes and humans . They were widespread throughout Eastern and Northern Africa 3.9 to 3 million years ago .
The brains of most species of Australopithecus were roughly 35 % of the size of that of a modern human brain . This is not much more than the brain of a chimpanzee . Brain size in hominins does not increase significantly until the arrival of the genus Homo .
The Taung specimen had short canine teeth , and the position of the foramen magnum was evidence of bipedal locomotion .
Most species of Australopithecus were diminutive and gracile , usually standing between 1.2 to 1.4 m tall -LRB- approx . 4 to 4.5 feet -RRB- . There is a considerable degree of sexual dimorphism . Modern hominids do not show sexual dimorphism to the same degree â '' particularly , modern humans display a low degree of sexual dimorphism , with males being only 15 % larger -LRB- taller , heavier -RRB- than females , on average .
In Australopithecus , however , males can be up to 50 % larger than females , though usually less pronounced than this .
The skeleton , the fossil footprints found at Laetoli , Tanzania , the canine teeth and the foramen magnum all show that these apes had achieved bipedalism .
Australopithecus africanus used to be regarded as ancestral to the genus Homo -LRB- in particular Homo erectus -RRB- .
However , fossils assigned to the genus Homo have been found that are older than A. africanus . Thus , the genus Homo either split off from the genus Australopithecus at an earlier date -LRB- the latest common ancestor being A. afarensis or an even earlier form , possibly Kenyanthropus platyops -RRB- , or both developed from a yet possibly unknown common ancestor independently .
According to the Chimpanzee Genome Project , both human -LRB- Ardipithecus , Australopithecus and Homo -RRB- and chimpanzee -LRB- Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus -RRB- lineages diverged from a common ancestor about 5 to 6 million years ago , if we assume a constant rate of evolution .
However , hominins discovered more recently are somewhat older than the molecular clock would theorize . Sahelanthropus tchadensis , commonly called `` Toumai '' is about 7 million years old and Orrorin tugenensis lived at least 6 million years ago . Since little is known of them , they remain controversial because the molecular clock in humans has determined that humans and chimpanzees had an evolutionary split at least a million years later .
One theory suggests that the human and chimpanzee lineages diverged somewhat at first , then some populations interbred around one million years after diverging . More likely , the assumptions behind molecular clocks do not hold exactly . The key assumption behind the technique is that , in the long run , changes in molecular structure happen at a steady rate . Researchers such as Ayala have challenged this assumption .
A joystick is an input device consisting of a stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is controlling . Joysticks are often used to control video games , and usually have one or more push-buttons whose state can also be read by the computer . A popular variation of the joystick used on modern video game consoles is the analog stick .
The joystick has been the principal flight control in the cockpit of many aircraft , particularly military fast jets , where center stick or side-stick location may be employed .
Joysticks are also used for controlling machines such as cranes , trucks , underwater unmanned vehicles and zero turning radius lawn mowers . Miniature finger-operated joysticks have been adopted as input devices for smaller electronic equipment such as mobile phones .
Paranthropus aethiopicus is an extinct species of hominid . The finding discovered in 1985 in Turkana , Kenya , KNM WT 17000 -LRB- known as the `` Black Skull '' due to the dark coloration of the bone , caused by high levels of manganese -RRB- , is one of the earliest examples of robust hominids from Pliocene . The skull is dated to 2.5 million years ago , older than the later forms of robust australopithecines . Anthropologists suggest that P. aethiopicus lived between 2.7 and 2.5 million years ago .

Hunger is the feeling of wanting to eat . The opposite of hunger is called satiety or fullness . The feeling is started in the hypothalamus , and hormones are released from the liver . People who have eaten can survive weeks without eating , but they will start to feel hungry after they have not eaten for a few hours . Hunger is generally considered quite uncomfortable . People who have eaten food usually will feel less hungry , or not hungry at all . People can live longer without food than without water .
Hunger is also used to refer to people who generally have little to eat , and are therefore often hungry .

Die Hard with a Vengeance is a 1995 action movie starring Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson . It is the third movie in the Die Hard series .
Simon Gruber is the older brother of the villain from the first movie , Hans Gruber . Simon destroys a building in New York City . He says that he will destroy another one unless the police do what he tells them to do . His first task is to have John McClane to go Harlem and stand around for 15 minutes with a sign that says `` I hate niggers '' with his gun taped to his back so that he can not reach it . A group of black men attack McClane . A shopkeeper named Zeus Carver saves McClane by grabbing the gun and getting into a taxicab .
The next task that Gruber has them do is to reach a pay phone . He then gives them a riddle and has them call back within 30 seconds to the right phone number -LRB- the answer to the riddle is the last four digits -RRB- or else the trash can full of explosives will be detonated . They call back with the right phone number but it is past 30 seconds . Carver and McClane duck out of the way as Gruber laughs .
The third task that Gruber sets for them is to reach the Wall Street subway station by 10:20 a.m. or else the station will be blown up . McClane and Carver steal a taxicab and cut through the park to reach the station in time . McClane stops at an earlier station and gets on the train . He then searches the train for the bomb and finds it . He throws it out of the cab car . Carver gets to the Wall Street station and picks up the phone , but because McClane is not there , Gruber says they did not follow his rules . The train rolls over the detonator and sets it off . The bomb explodes and destroys a large part of the station . McClane is injured but is alive .
The FBI come in and tell him that the man 's name is Simon Gruber and that he is Hans ' brother . Simon calls in again and tells him that he has placed a bomb inside one of the schools in New York City . Any attempt to get the children out will result in the bomb being blown up . He tells McClane and Carver to head to a park . The entire police force goes out and starts to search every school to find the bomb .
With the police gone , Simon Gruber and a bunch of dump trucks come in . They kill the security guards and begin to steal the gold from the vault in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . McClane and Carver arrive at the park and find another bomb . They use a five-gallon and three-gallon jug to make four gallons and put it on the weight to disable it . McClane catches a kid stealing something ; the kid says that there 's not a cop for miles around . McClane then goes to the Federal Reserve building and walks in . As Gruber 's men escort him down , he asks them about lotto numbers and realizes that they 're not the real cops and kills them .
McClane then drives a car out to intercept Gruber and his men . He has Carver go out to Yankee Stadium since that 's what Gruber originally told them to do . Gruber drives into a aqueduct . McClane follows them in , but they flood it , causing a ton of water to rush out . McClane grabs a ladder and is sent flying into the air . Meanwhile , Carver went to Yankee Stadium and did not find anybody . Two of Gruber 's men with sniper rifles are there to kill him , but decide to follow Carver instead since McClane is not with him . Carver is driving on a highway and sees McClane as he is thrown into the air . A car chase and gunfight take place as Gruber 's men show up to try to kill them .
McClane and Carver find Gruber loading the gold onto a cargo boat in New York Harbor . After getting in , a few battles take place and Carver and McClane are captured by Gruber 's men . They are then tied up and Gruber sets the fuse to blow the boat up . Before leaving , Gruber tosses McClane a bottle of aspirin . Gruber claims he is blowing up $ 100 billion of gold bullion but there is nothing inside ; he is trying to make the value of gold higher by `` destroying '' the supply . McClane and Carver work their way out of the cuffs and jump to safety as the ship blows up .
They are rescued by the police . On the ship , McClane takes a quarter to call his wife . As he is being connected , he takes an aspirin , looks at the bottom , and realizes that Gruber is heading to Canada . They intercept him and fly a helicopter over his ship . In the ensuring fight , Gruber gets in his own helicopter and shoots and hits their helicopter , forcing them to land . McClane starts running to make Gruber shoot at him . He notices a bunch of power lines and shoots them . The lines fall on Gruber 's helicopter and kill him .

Multan Division -LRB- Urdu : Ø Ù Ø Ù Ú Ù Ù Ø Ø Ù -RRB- was an administrative division of the Punjab of Pakistan , until the reforms of 2000 abolished the third tier of government .
Multan Division was created during British Rule in the subcontinent . The division lay between 28 Â 25 ' and 33 Â 13 N and 69 Â 19 ' and 73 Â 39 E , the Sutlej divided it from Bahawalpur on the south-east , while the Indus flowed partly through the Division and partly along its border to the west . The headquarters of the Commissioner were at Multan , or , in the hot season , at . Fort Munro . The Division was abolished in 1884 , but reconstituted in 1901 . According to the 1881 census of India the population of the area now included was 2,036,956 , in 1891 it had risen to 2,277,605 , and in 1901 to 3,014,675 . The total area was 29,520 square miles , the division was composed of the following districts :

It then continues northward from the International border at Nogales past the Tumacacori National Historical Park , Tubac , Green Valley , Sahuarita , San Xavier del Bac , and Tucson to the Santa Cruz Flats just to the south of Casa Grande and the Gila River .
Meiosis is a special type of cell division . Unlike mitosis , the way normal body cells divide , meiosis results in cells that only have half the usual number of chromosomes , one from each pair . For that reason , meiosis is often called reduction division . In the long run , meiosis increases genetic variation , in a way which will be explained later .
Sexual reproduction takes place when a sperm fertilizes an egg . The eggs and sperm are special cells called gametes , or sex cells . Gametes are haploid ; they have only half the number of chromosomes as a normal body cell -LRB- called a somatic cell -RRB- . Fertilization restores the chromosomes in body cells to the diploid number .
The basic number of chromosomes in the body cells of a species is called the somatic number and is designated 2n . Thus , in humans 2n = 46 . We have 46 chromosomes . In the sex cells the chromosome number is n -LRB- humans : n = 23 -RRB- . So , in normal diploid organisms , chromosomes are present in two copies , one from each parent -LRB- 23x2 = 46 -RRB- . The only exception are the sex chomosomes . In mammals , the female has two X chromosomes , and the male one X and one Y chromosome .
A karyotype is the characteristic chromosome number of a eukaryote species . The preparation and study of karyotypes is part of cytogenetics , the genetics of cells .
All eukaryotes that reproduce sexually use meiosis . This also includes single-celled organisms . Meiosis does not occur in archaea or bacteria , which reproduce via asexual processes such as binary fission .
The offspring gets a set of chromosomes from each parent so that , overall , half of its heredity comes from each parent . But the two sets of chromosomes are not identical with the parental chromosomes . This is because they are changed during the reduction division by a process called crossing-over .
1 . First , to reduce the chromosomes in each egg or sperm to one set only . 2 . To allow crossing-over to take place between each pair of parental chromosomes . Although the gametes have only one set of chromosomes , that set is a mixture of genetic material from both parents . Every single egg or sperm has a different selection from the parental chromosomes . The basic reason is that at any particular locus on the chromosomes there may be different alleles -LRB- forms of the gene -RRB- on the two chromosomes . Thus crossing-over changes some of the alleles on a particular chromosome . Take two deck of cards . Keep spades and hearts from each pack ; discard the rest . Take the two suits from pack 1 . Now select one ace , one king , one queen -LRB- etc -RRB- at random from one or other of the two suits , until 13 cards have been selected . You now have 13 cards from ace to deuce , but taken from two suits . Now do the same thing with the two suits from the second pack . Then you have another 13 cards . When you put the two sets together -LRB- fertilization -RRB- you have 26 cards drawn from the two suits , and yet they are not the same 26 cards you started with . Sometimes you will have genes from both parents -LRB- color of suits -RRB- ; sometimes from the same parent.Crossing-over between chromosomes takes place in meiosis , and it is called recombination . It means that every sperm and every egg is a bit different in its genes . That is why offspring of two parents look similar , but not identical .
As with shuffling a deck of cards , many different combinations of genes can be produced without a change -LRB- mutation -RRB- in any individual gene . This greatly increases the variety of the offspring , and the variety gives at least some of the offspring a better chance of surviving in difficult times . `` It is not difficult to think of reasons why sexual populations should have long-term advantages over asexual ones . They can evolve more rapidly to meet changing circumstances ... '' The recombination -LRB- crossing-over -RRB- which takes place in meiosis may be the reason why sexual reproduction exists at all .
Several quite large taxa -LRB- groups of organisms -RRB- use cyclical parthenogenesis . This is when several generations are born by virgin birth , and then a generation occurs with normal sexual reproduction . Examples include aphids , and cladocerans -LRB- small crustacea called water fleas -RRB- . Aphids usually operate as follows : when the weather is good , and their plant hosts are at their best , they use parthenogenesis . At the end of the season , when the weather gets worse , they use sexual reproduction . This system of reproduction is called apogamy .
In parthenogenesis , the eggs contain only the mother 's genetic material , and they are not fertilized . The egg cells may be produced either by meiosis or mitosis . When meiosis occurs , crossing-over produces a genetic fingerprint which differs somewhat from the mother 's . So , the parthenogenetic greenfly offspring are not identical , and do show some genetic variation : some chromosome segments differ because of meiosis . Mitosis would produce identical offspring .
Amongst these parthenogenetic taxa are a number of species which have entirely abandoned sex .
A few eukaryote organisms have completely lost the ability for sexual reproduction , and so do not have meiosis . These include the Bdelloid rotifers , which only reproduce by parthenogenesis .
Meiosis can be divided into Meiosis I and Meiosis II .
The function of the first division is to permit crossing over . Just like Mitosis , meiosis includes Prophase , Metaphase , Anaphase and Telophase .
Prophase I : The chromosomes become visible , the nuclear envelope disappears and the centrioles -LRB- located at the top and bottom of the nucleus -RRB- begin forming spindle fibers that envelope the chromosomes .
At this stage each chromosome is split into two sister chromatids , held together by the centromeres . The paired chromosomes now have four chromatids -LRB- 2 sets of ` sisters ' -RRB- pressed together . Crossing over takes place between two of the non-sister chromatids ; the other two remain uncrossed . The crossover results in the exchange of segments of each of the participating chromatids , DNA and associated chromatin protein . Genetically , the process is called recombination .
Metaphase I : The chromosomes line up along the equatorial -LRB- the central line -RRB- of the spindle fibers in homologous pairs .
Anaphase I : The chromosomes are divided so that there are equal amounts on either side of the cell . As there are 46 chromosomes in a human cell , 23 end up on either side .
-LRB- Cytokinesis , the division of cells into two , takes place . The cell divides . -RRB-
Telophase I : The two daughter cells are completely divided , a nucleic envelope forms and the chromosomes become less visible . There are 23 chromosomes in each of these cells .
The two cells prepare to divide again in a stage known as Interkinesis or Interphase II . Both of these cells will go through meiosis II .
Prophase II : The chromosomes become visible , the nuclear envelope disappears and the centrioles form the spindle fibers .
Anaphase II : The chromosomes get split into its two chromatids . Chromatids are the two strands of DNA -LRB- deoxyribo-nucleic acid -RRB- that make up the chromosome . They are joined by a mid-way connection called a centromere .
-LRB- Cytokinesis takes place . The cell divides . -RRB-
Telophase II : The cells are completely divided . The nucleic envelope reforms and four new cells with different DNA are created .
In males , all four cells become sperm . In females , only one becomes a mature egg , while the remaining three become re-absorbed into the body .
In humans , there are certain conditions that are caused by a meiosis gone wrong . Examples are :
Ocimum tenuiflorum -LRB- also known as Ocimum sanctum , Tulsi , TulasÄ `` -LRB- à à à à à â -RRB- in Sanskrit and Hindi , -LRB- à à à à à -RRB- in Malayalam , -LRB- à à à à à -RRB- in Tamil , -LRB- à à à à à -RRB- in Kannada , Maduruthala in Sinhalese -RRB- is an plant in the family Lamiaceae . It is also called Holy Basil .
Digital Divide is the name of the gap , in a branch of technology , between parts of the world where technologies as internet , mobile phones , computers , wi-fi there are , and the parts of the world where there are not .
A Digital Divide can born for many reasons like socioeconomic problems -LRB- few people are rich and lots are poor -RRB- , racial problems -LRB- there is a majority or a minority that control the other -RRB- , or geographical problems -LRB- in the cities there are technologies but there are not in rural areas -RRB- .
An example of Digital Divide we can see if we think about countries as Canada , the United States , Japan , South Korea , Western Europe and North Europe and Australasia , where there are big internet connection developments , or where technologies are cheaps , and after we think about Latin America , Africa , and Southeast Asia , where there are many social problems and where technologies has a long way before to get interest in those countries , for problems as , price of technology , and sometimes because there is not resources for help it . The Digital Divide is a big problem for the world , because it help others problems , and probability the richer parts of the world will be always be the richest , and the poorer parts , will always be the poorest .
In some parts of world there is a large Digital divide . Sometimes it is just in half of a country , or just a region , for example Africa . There are big cities where technologies are really cheap and there are lots of villages and rural communities where there is no technology . In this case the Digital Divide creates others problems . Because a part of the country is rich and another part is poor there are often problems with trading and connections .
Many rich countries -LRB- for example , Canada , United States , Japan , Italy , France , United Kingdom -RRB- send old computers or make charity projects by no-profit associations or communities or projects for the school in poor countries , as One Laptop Per Child , to fight the digital divide and to make a culture involving internet and other technologies .

The Australian dollar -LRB- AUD -RRB- is the official currency of the Commonwealth of Australia . It has been in use since February 14 , 1966 . The Australian dollar is also used on Christmas Island , Cocos -LRB- Keeling -RRB- Islands , Norfolk Island , and the independent Pacific Islands of Kiribati , Nauru and Tuvalu . In Australia the dollar symbol $ is usually used . The signs A$ or AU$ are often used to show that it is the Australian dollar . It is subdivided into 100 cents .
In 2007 the Australian dollar was the sixth-most-traded currency in world . The most traded currencies were the Euro , US dollar , the yen , the pound sterling , and the Swiss franc .
The Australian dollar is liked by people who trade in currencies . This is because Australia has high interest rates and little government control on currency trading . Australia 's economy and political systems are also seen to be stable .
The dollar was introduced on 14 February 1966 , replacing the Australian pound .
From 1966 , coins were made in amounts of 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 cents . One-dollar coins were made from 1984 . Two-dollar coins in were made from 1988 . The one - and two-cent coins were not made after 1991 and are no longer used . Cash sales are made to the nearest five cents . All coins have the image of the head of state , Queen Elizabeth II on the back . They are made by the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra .
Australia has often made special 50-cent coins . The first was in 1970 , to honor Captain Cook 's finding the east coast of Australia . In 1977 a coin was made for Queen Elizabeth II 's Silver Jubilee . In 1981 a coin was made for the wedding of Charles and Diana . The Brisbane Commonwealth Games had a special coin in 1982 . Another one was made for the Australian Bicentenary in 1988 . There have been many more special coins made since the 1990s . They are popular with people who collect coins . Australia has also made special 20-cent and one-dollar coins .
Australia has made special five-dollar coins , of aluminium\/bronze and bi-metal , and many silver and gold bullion coins in bigger values . These are not normally used , although they are legal tender .
Current Australian 5 - , 10 - and 20-cent coins are the same size as the old Australian , New Zealand and British sixpenny , shilling and two shilling -LRB- florin -RRB- coins . In 1990 . the UK replaced these coins with smaller versions , as did New Zealand in 2006 - at the same time discontinuing the five-cent coin . The Australian 50-cent coin is a large coin . It weighs 15.55 grams and is 31.51 mm across .
The first paper banknotes in Australian dollars were printed in 1966 . The one , two , ten and 20-dollars notes matched the old pound banknotes . The five-dollar note was printed in 1967 , after the public were used to decimal currency .
The one-dollar note was replaced by a coin in 1984 . The two-dollar note was replaced by a coin in 1988 . The 50-dollar note was first printed in 1973 . In 1984 Australia printed the 100-dollar note .
Notes are different sizes depending on their value . This is to help people are visually impaired -LRB- unable to see properly -RRB- . They are the same height but different lengths . The $ 5 is the smallest , $ 100 the largest . Notes are also color coded : $ 5 pink -LRB- there are two designs -RRB- ; $ 10 blue ; $ 20 red ; $ 50 yellow ; and $ 100 green .
In 1988 , the Reserve Bank of Australia gave out plastic , -LRB- polypropylene -RRB- polymer banknotes -LRB- produced by Note Printing Australia -RRB- , to celebrate 200 years of European settlement in Australia . All Australian notes are now made of polymer .
To make it hard to copy these notes , they have see through windows with a picture image of Captain James Cook . Every note also has a seven-pointed star which has only half the printing on each side . Australian banknotes were the first in the world to use such features .
Manche is a department found in the west of France in the Basse-Normandie region . Its prefecture is Saint-L Ã and its population is about 486,000 -LRB- 2006 estimation -RRB- . It is one of the 83 first French departments made during the French revolution .
Coventry is a city and metropolitan borough in the West Midlands county in England . It was badly bombed in World War II .
The Revised Julian calendar is a variation of the Julian calendar . It is mainly used by Eastern Orthodox churches . Some Eastern Orthodox churches introduced it in 1923 .
Until the year 2800 , this calendar will be in sync with the Gregorian calendar ; From 2800 to 2900 , the Gregorian calendar will be 1 day off .
A megabyte is a large number used when talking about hard drives or computer memory . One megabyte is 1 million bytes .
Until December 1998 , when the International Electrotechnical Commission -LRB- IEC -RRB- first defined a mebibyte as 220 , or 1,048,576 bytes , megabyte also meant either 1,048,576 bytes , or 1,024,000 bytes . It is also equal to 1,024 kilobytes . Casual computer users still often use megabyte to mean one of these numbers .
The Celtic Sea is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland . To the east of it are the Saint George 's Channel , the Bristol Channel , the English Channel , and the Bay of Biscay , as well as adjacent portions of Wales , Cornwall , Devon , and Brittany . The southern and western boundaries are based on the continental shelf .
The Exponential distribution is a probability distribution . It is only used on the positive real numbers . Its main use is to assess the duration of random time intervals . Examples where it can be used :
Alexander I of Russia -LRB- , Aleksandr I Pavlovich -RRB- -LRB- â `` -RRB- , also known as Alexander the Blessed -LRB- , Aleksandr Blagoslovennyi -RRB- was Emperor of Russia from 23 March 1801 to 1 December 1825 and the first Russian King of Poland from 1815 to 1825 . He was also the first Russian Grand Duke of Finland and Lithuania .
He was born in Saint Petersburg to Grand Duke Paul Petrovich , later Emperor Paul I , and Maria Feodorovna , daughter of the Duke of WÃ 1\/4 rttemberg . He succeeded to the throne after his father was murdered , and ruled Russia during the Napoleonic Wars .
His sudden death in Taganrog , under allegedly suspicious circumstances , caused the spread of the rumors that Alexander did not die in 1825 , but disappeared to live the rest of his life in anonymity .
On 9 October 1793 , Alexander married Louise of Baden , known as Elisabeth Alexeyevna after her conversion to the Orthodox Church . He later told his friend Frederick William III that the marriage , a political match devised by his grandmother , Catherine the Great , regrettably proved to be a misfortune for him and his wife . Their two children of the marriage died young .
Alexander had nine illegitimate children .
Tsar Alexander I became increasingly suspicious of those around him , especially after an attempt was made to kidnap him when he was on his way to the conference in Aachen , Germany .
In the autumn of 1825 the Emperor sailed to the south of Russia due to the increasing illness of his wife . During his trip he caught a cold which developed into typhus from which he died in the southern city of Taganrog on 19 November -LRB- O.S. -RRB- \/ 1 December 1825 . His wife died a few months later as the emperor 's body was transported to Saint Petersburg for the funeral . He was interred at the Sts . Peter and Paul Cathedral of the Peter and Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg on 13 March 1826 .
The unexpected death of the Emperor of Russia far from the capital caused rumors that his death and funeral were staged so he could spend the rest of his life in solitude . Some say the former emperor became a monk in either Pochaev Lavra or Kievo-Pecherskaya Lavra or elsewhere . Many people , including some historians , have theorized that a mysterious hermit , Feodor Kuzmich , -LRB- or Kozmich -RRB- who emerged in Siberia in 1836 , died in the vicinity of Tomsk in 1864 and was eventually glorified as a saint of the Orthodox Church , was Alexander I under an assumed identity . While there are testimonies that `` Feodor Kozmich '' in his earlier life might have belonged to a higher level of society , claims that he was Alexander I were never established beyond reasonable doubt .
Alexander I was the godfather of future Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom who was christened Alexandrina Victoria in honor of the tsar .
Alexander I was the namesake for the Alexanderplatz in Berlin , Germany , and of the Alexandertorte .

The Great Seal of the State of Alabama is the state seal of the U.S. state of Alabama . It was designed in 1817 by William Wyatt Bibb , the governor of the `` Alabama Territory '' and the subsequent first governor of the state . When Alabama became a state in 1819 , the state legislature got the design as the official state seal . The seal prominently has a map showing one of the state 's most valuable resourcesâ '' its major rivers . Bibb 's design served as the official seal until 1868 , when it was replaced by a controversial design having on it an eagle holding in its beak a banner that read `` Here We Rest . '' The legislature and Governor Frank M. Dixon restored Bibb 's original design in 1939 , and it has remained unchanged since .

A nuclear weapon is a weapon that suddenly releases the energy in the nucleus of certain types of atoms . When triggered , these devices release a huge amount of energy in the form of an explosion . Nuclear weapons are also known as `` atomic bombs '' , `` atom bombs '' , or `` A-bombs '' . Nuclear weapons are very powerful , and one nuclear weapon can destroy a city . They get their energy by changing some of their matter into energy . This is called a nuclear explosion . Nuclear explosions are difficult to ignite and control , and require uranium or plutonium that has been enriched for reactive isotopes . These isotopes are not concentrated enough in natural uranium to cause explosions .
The first nuclear weapons were created by the United States during World War II and used against the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan . This is the only time in history when nuclear weapons have been used in combat . This development was called the Manhattan Project . The Manhattan Project took place in Los Alamos , New Mexico . The first atomic bomb was tested at the Trinity site at White Sands in southern New Mexico .
Nuclear weapons are made from the elements uranium or plutonium . Certain forms of these elements can be made to undergo nuclear fission and have a nuclear chain reaction . This produces a very large amount of energy and radiation , and will kill any people or animals within several kilometers . Much of the radiation is X-rays , which heats air to produce a huge nuclear fireball . The rapid expansion of the fireball produces a dangerous shock wave that destroys houses or buildings even several kilometers away . It will eventually kill people farther away than several kilometers depending on how much radiation the person received . The mutations in the DNA cause cancer and radiation poisoning . Nuclear bombs release fallout , which is nuclear material and dust that has been irradiated and became radioactive . This poisonous dust is blown by the winds for tens or hundreds of kilometers , and can remain dangerous for several years .
A hydrogen bomb , or fusion bomb , is a nuclear weapon which utilizes hydrogen isotopes -LRB- deuterium and tritium -RRB- as another type of fuel . Hydrogen bombs can be many hundreds of times more powerful than fission bombs . Despite the name , in hydrogen bombs in use , the hydrogen is only there to produce enough neutrons to also detonate a casing made of natural uranium . The fuel in hydrogen bombs is thus mostly unrefined uranium .
The delivery of the nuclear weapon to its target is as complex as making one . A nuclear explosive device can be placed in a bomb , or into a missile , which is called a nuclear missile . Nuclear bombs can be carried by aircraft . Nuclear missiles can be carried by aircraft , submarines , or trucks , or they can be placed into underground missile silos . Strategic bomber aircraft like the B-36 Peacemaker , B-52 Stratofortress and B-2 Spirit are used to carry nuclear weapons . They are also carried by missiles , such as intercontinental ballistic missiles -LRB- ICBM -RRB- , or submarine-launched ballistic missiles -LRB- SLBM 's -RRB- . Some missiles travel to the border of space , and then launch a number of separate nuclear weapons back toward the ground , and each one can travel to a different target . This is called a MIRV Warhead , or Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles . Very large nuclear bombs have been produced , by in practice a MIRV can produce as much damage from several smaller explosions .
Nuclear weapons cost a lot of money to make , because the materials they are made of are very rare and it takes many scientists to make them . But many countries have managed to create nuclear weapons . Many countries in the world possess nuclear weapons today . In the order that they first made nuclear weapons , they are : United States -LRB- 1945 -RRB- , Russia -LRB- 1949 -RRB- , United Kingdom -LRB- 1952 -RRB- , France -LRB- 1960 -RRB- , China -LRB- 1964 -RRB- , India -LRB- 1974 -RRB- , and Pakistan -LRB- 1998 -RRB- . Israel is thought to also have nuclear weapons , but the government says they do not . Many people said that North Korea had nuclear weapons , and they have said that they do but now they say that they will not make any more . In -LRB- 2006 -RRB- , North Korea held their first official nuclear test . South Africa once had nuclear weapons , but now says that it has destroyed them all . Iran is believed to be making nuclear weapons , but they say they are just making nuclear energy . When countries get or try to get nuclear weapons , it is called nuclear proliferation .

Tropical Storm Gabrielle was a tropical storm that moved over eastern North Carolina before turning out to the sea . It was the seventh named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season . Gabrielle formed as a subtropical cyclone on September 8 about 385 miles -LRB- 625 km -RRB- southeast of Cape Lookout , North Carolina . Wind shear affected the storm for much of its existence , although a brief decrease in the shear allowed the system to strengthen into a tropical storm . On September 9 , Gabrielle made landfall on the coast of North Carolina . Turning to the northeast , the storm quickly weakened and died out on September 11 . The storm dropped heavy rainfall near its actual landfall location but little precipitation in other areas . Total damage was minor , and there were no reported deaths .
A dying cold front moved off the coast of Georgia on September 2 , leaving an area of clouds and showers that slowly moved eastward . This area began to organize , and by late on September 4 , the thunderstorms had built up to the east of the system 's center . On September 5 , a Hurricane Hunters aircraft reported that the system had not yet become a tropical or subtropical cyclone . A trough caused some wind shear , which stopped the storm from gaining any strength . However , the area soon became more favorable for the storm to strengthen .
Because of this , the storm started to develop , about halfway between North Carolina and Bermuda . The storm began to turn slowly toward the west-northwest . On September 7 , its center became slightly stronger . On September 8 , the storm was named Subtropical Storm Gabrielle by the National Hurricane Center . At this time , Gabrielle was about 385 miles -LRB- 625 km -RRB- southeast of Cape Lookout , North Carolina .
After becoming a subtropical cyclone , Gabrielle was found to be in an area with cooler air to the north , dry air to the south and west , some wind shear , and cooler water temperatures along the storm 's path . These conditions made it so the storm could not strengthen much . However , a curved band of thunderstorms formed in the storm 's northern and western sections , and the circulation became better organized . Later , the rainbands died out , leaving the center of the low pressure system far away from the area of thunderstorms . To be a strong tropical cyclone , the center and the thunderstorms need to be located over each other . Soon , the storm began to gain more strength , and it was re-named to Tropical Storm Gabrielle on September 7 while located about 185 miles -LRB- 300 km -RRB- southeast of Cape Lookout , North Carolina .
Wind shear slowly went down as the storm passed over the Gulf Stream , allowing strong thunderstorms to quickly form near the center , and at about 15:45 UTC , Tropical Storm Gabrielle hit the coast of North Carolina . It had winds possibly as strong as 60 mph -LRB- 95 km\/h -RRB- at time . The storm turned to the north and north-northeast , and re-entered the ocean on September 10 . Gabrielle weakened to a tropical depression , and still kept scattered thunderstorms near it as it tracked along the northern part of the Gulf Stream . By midday on September 11 , Gabrielle died out to the south of Canada . By early the next day , the remnants of Gabrielle were absorbed by another cold front .
When Gabrielle became a subtropical storm , the National Hurricane Center sent out a tropical storm watch from Edisto Beach , South Carolina to Oregon Inlet in North Carolina , including the Pamlico Sound . As the storm came close to land , the storm watch for areas south of Cape Fear , North Carolina was taken away . At the same time , a tropical storm warning was declared from Surf City , North Carolina to the North Carolina â `` Virginia state border . A tropical storm watch was also issued for parts of the Delmarva Peninsula and Chesapeake Bay .
Before the storm arrived , the National Park Service closed visitor centers and campgrounds along the Outer Banks . For about 12 hours , the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was closed down . The governor of North Carolina put rescue teams on standby . Some people were told to tighten down loose objects , and to stay inside when the storm passed over . Because the tropical storm was expected to be minor , no evacuations were ordered . On Ocracoke Island , boats were taken out to prepare for Gabrielle . The threat of the storm made it so a fishing contest was canceled at Atlantic Beach .
At first , forecasters , or weather men , were not sure where Gabrielle would go . They said it was possible for the storm to hit areas as far north as New York . Big waves and rip currents were predicted , so the Coast Guard helped to prepare for the storm in the Northeastern United States . On Cape Cod , Massachusetts , a jet airplane flew along the coastline , giving storm advisories to offshore boats . A Coast Guard patrol boat was sent offshore for search and rescue . Sailors were told to be very careful in the storm . However , the storm passed well to the south with little effect .
Large waves from Gabrielle along the coast of Florida caused a surfer to drown . Around 200 others had to be rescued from the rough seas . People at New Smyrna Beach , Florida said waves reached 6 t.
By September 9 , the outer rainbands of the cyclone began hitting southeastern North Carolina . Constant high winds occurred along coast , reaching 44 miles per hour -LRB- 71 km\/h -RRB- at Frisco . Wind gusts were sometimes stronger ; a gust of 61 miles per hour -LRB- 98 km\/h -RRB- was recorded at Ocracoke . Along the coast of North Carolina , waves were 10 t high . Rip currents caused many swimmers to be rescued by lifeguards . There was not much rain from the storm in most areas , but near the storm 's center , 9.03 inches -LRB- 229 mm -RRB- of rain fell .
A taxicab number is the name given by mathematicians to a series of special numbers : 2 , 1729 etc. . A taxicab number is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes in n distinct ways . It has nothing to do with taxis , but the name comes from a well-known conversation that took place between two famous mathematicians : Godfrey Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan .
Godfrey Hardy was a professor of mathematics at Cambridge University . One day he went to visit a friend , the brilliant young Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan , who was ill. . Because both men were mathematicians they were always thinking about numbers .
When Ramanujan heard that Hardy had come in a taxi he asked him what the number of the taxi was . Hardy said that it was just a boring number : 1729 . Ramanujan replied that 1729 was not a boring number at all : it was a very interesting one . He explained that it was the smallest number that could be expressed by the sum of two cubes in two different ways .
This story is very famous among mathematicians . 1729 is sometimes called the â Hardy-Ramanujan numberâ .
There are two ways to say that 1729 is the sum of two cubes . 1x1x1 = 1 ; 12x12x12 = 1728 . So 1 +1728 = 1729 But also : 9x9x9 = 729 ; 10x10x10 = 1000 . So 729 +1000 = 1729 There are other numbers that can be shown to be the sum of two cubes in more than one way , but 1729 is the smallest of them .
Ramanujan did not actually discover this fact . It was known in 1657 by a French mathematician Bernard FrÃ nicle de Bessy .
Since the famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan , mathematicians have tried to find other interesting numbers that are the smallest number that can be expressed by the sum of two cubes in three\/four\/five etc different ways . These numbers are very , very big , and have been found by computers .

A shock wave is when lots of energy comes from a very small spot . The shockwave can be so powerful that it can knock things over ! Bombs create shockwaves . A shockwave happens because the energy pushes air really fast , and then the air can hit things . Bombs are made more dangerous because of shockwaves .
A Shockwave can move through any material . An earthquake is a shockwave traveling through the ground . Shockwaves are affected by the materials they travel through .
A sound wave is a collection of shockwaves . The frequency of a sound is how frequently those shockwaves hit your ear . The amplitude is the strength or size of the shockwaves .

The Governor-General of Pakistan was the resident representative of King George VI in Pakistan from 1947 to 1952 and then Queen Elizabeth II -LRB- `` Queen of Pakistan '' -RRB- from 1952 until 1956 when Pakistan was proclaimed a republic .
When Pakistan became an independent , self-governing nation in 1947 , it , like post-independent India , provisionally continued to use the Government of India Act 1935 , as its written constitution until a post-independence constitution could be drafted ; by default this contemplated the continuation of the constitutional monarchy as a Commonwealth realm dominion .
The monarch appointed a Governor-General , upon the advice of the Prime Minister of Pakistan to serve as de facto Head of State .
Muhammad Ali Jinnah , considered Quaid-e-Azam -LRB- `` Great Leader '' -RRB- , informed Lord Mountbatten : `` when I am Governor-General the Prime Minister will do what I tell him to '' -- however Jinnah 's rapidly declining health made the issue moot .
After Jinnah 's death the Governor-General of Pakistan continued to serve a larger role than the India Act prescribed , dismissing multiple Prime Ministers and consolidating power .
The office of Governor-General was replaced by the office of President of Pakistan when Pakistan became a republic in 1956 . The then Governor-General , Iskander Mirza , became Pakistan 's first president .
The chloralkali process is a process used to create sodium hydroxide , chlorine , and hydrogen from sodium chloride and water . It is normally conducted in a tank separated by a membrane , although there are other methods , such as using mercury . If potassium chloride or calcium chloride is used instead , potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide are produced . When the membrane is not in place , hypochlorites are formed . If it is heated , chlorates are formed .
The process is fueled by electrolysis . It can be done in the laboratory .

Captain Jack Harkness is a fictional character in the British television series Doctor Who and Torchwood . He is played by actor John Barrowman . He was first in Doctor Who in the 2005 episode `` The Empty Child '' and is in the show throughout the rest of the 2005 series as a companion of the Ninth Doctor . Jack later becomes the main character in Torchwood , an adult-themed spin-off of Doctor Who . He comes back into Doctor Who in the 2007 series and he meets the Tenth Doctor , and returned again for the 2008 series .
Jack is a time traveller and former con man from the 51st century . A bisexual . In contrast to the wiser and older Doctor , Jack prefers a hands-on solution to the problem at hand . As a consequence of his death and being brought back in the last episode of the 2005 series of Doctor Who , the character becomes immortal , which does not change during both Doctor Who and Torchwood .
In naming the character , executive producer and head writer Russell T Davies got inspiration from the Marvel Comics character Agatha Harkness , Jack 's original appearances in Doctor Who were thought of with the intention of forming a character arc in which Jack is changed from a coward to a hero , and John Barrowman consciously minded this in his portrayal of the character . Following on that arc , the character 's debut episode would leave his morality as ambiguous , publicity materials asking , `` Is he a force for good or ill ? ''
The character is described as both `` lethally charming ... good looking and utterly captivating '' , as well as `` flirtatious , cunning , clever and a bit of an action man '' . Within Doctor Who , Jack 's personality is light-hearted , although this changes in Torchwoods first series , where he becomes a darker character . In Torchwood Series 1 , Jack has been shaped by his ongoing search for the Doctor and also by his role as a leader , in which he is predominantly more aloof . During The second series of Torchwood , Jack became a much more light-hearted character once again , after appearances in Doctor Who where he was reunited with the Doctor .
From the Torchwood onwards , Harkness wears period military clothes from the second World War , including braces and an officer 's wool greatcoat in every appearance . Costume designer Ray Holman comments that `` We always wanted to keep the World War Two hero look for him , so all his outfits have a 1940s flavor . We knew he 'd be running around a lot , so I redesigned his RAF Group Captain 's greatcoat from Doctor Who to make it more fluid , because the real things are very weighty ... The rest of Jack 's costumes are loosely wartime based , so he has big wartime trousers which are getting more and more styled to suit his figure . There are actually five Captain Jack coats used on the show - one hero version which is used for most scenes , one wetcoat made with a pre-shrunk fabric , a running coat which is slightly shorter so John 's heels do not catch when he runs and two stunt coats - which were ` hero coats ' back in Series 1 . ''
Discussing whether his character could ever find a soulmate , John Barrowman refutes that Jack `` likes everybody , and his love for each person is different '' . He believes that Jack does harbor romantic feelings toward the Doctor , but `` would never take that beyond infatuation '' and `` would never let the Doctor know '' . Barrowman describes Jack 's love for Ianto as `` lustful '' , and if he ever were to settle down with him , he would `` let Ianto know that he -LRB- Jack -RRB- has to play around on the side '' . John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack 's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack 's empathy , and helped to ground him . In contrast , if he settled down with Gwen , `` he 'd have to commit completely '' to her ; this is why he does not act on his feelings for her , because even though she would let him flirt with other people , he could `` never afford to do anything more Eve Myles , who portrays Gwen , describes theirs as a `` palpable love '' and opines that `` with Jack and Gwen , itâ s the real thing and theyâ re going to make you wait for that . '' Torchwood Series Two sees Jack promise both Gwen and Ianto that they were the reason he returned to Cardiff . Barrowman claims that Jack also `` fancies '' fellow companion Martha Jones , admiring her `` tenacity '' and willingness to `` spat with him '' , and describes Jack 's love for Toshiko and Owen as `` fatherly '' , stating `` He was guiding them . That 's why it was so devastating for him to lose them . '' Offering reasons why Jack could never find `` The One '' , Barrowman brings up the character 's immortality . `` He always loses them . He outlives them . They die . He watches them get old . That bothered him in Series One -LRB- of Torchwood -RRB- , but now he 's come to terms with that , I think ... so now he just sleeps around !

The orchestra started in 1842 , when Otto Nicolai formed the Philharmonische Academie . The members of this orchestra made all the decisions about how the orchestra should be organized , and the orchestra still works in this way today .
When Nicolai left in 1847 , the orchestra nearly came to an end . They did not play very much until 1860 , when Karl Anton Eckert joined as conductor . Since then , the orchestra has given concerts all the time .
From 1875 to 1898 Hans Richter was principal conductor , except for the season 1882-1883 when he had an argument with the orchestral committee . During the time Richter was conductor the orchestra gave the first performances of several very famous works , including Symphonies no 2 and 3 by Brahms and Symphony no 8 by Anton Bruckner .

The Praetorian Guard was a force of bodyguards used by Roman Emperors . The title was first used for the guards of generals in the Roman Republic . Their commander , the Praetorian Prefect , was often an important figure in the political scheming in Rome . The Guard was dissolved by Emperor Constantine I in the fourth century AD .
The term Praetorian derived from the tent of the commanding general or praetor of a Roman army in the field -- the praetorium . It was a habit of many Roman generals to choose from the ranks a private force of soldiers to act as guards of their person . This elite group of Roman citizens consisted of both infantry and cavalry . In time , this cohort came to be known as the cohors praetoria , and various notable figures possessed one , including Julius Caesar , Mark Antony and Augustus -LRB- Octavian -RRB- .
As Caesar discovered with the 10th Legion Equestris , a powerful mounted unit was desirable in the field . When Augustus became the first ruler of the Roman Empire in 27 BC , he decided such a formation was useful not only on the battlefield but in politics also . Thus , from the ranks of the legions throughout the provinces , Augustus recruited the Praetorian Guard .
Through the cunning of their ambitious prefect , Sejanus , the Guard was brought from their Italian barracks into Rome itself . In 23 , Sejanus convinced Tiberius to have the Praetorian fort built just outside Rome . One of the cohorts held the daily guard at the imperial palace . Henceforth the entire Guard was at the disposal of the emperors , but the rulers were now equally at the mercy of the Praetorians . The reality of this was seen in 31 when Tiberius was forced to rely upon his own cohors praetoria against partisans of Sejanus . Although the Praetorian Guard proved faithful to the aging Tiberius , their potential political power had been made clear .
While campaigning , the Praetorians were the equal of any formation in the Roman Army . Seldom used in the early reigns , they were quite active by 69 . Under Domitian and Trajan , the guard took part in wars from Dacia to Mesopotamia , while with Marcus Aurelius , years were spent on the Danube frontier . Throughout the 3rd century , the Praetorians assisted the emperors in various campaigns .
The relationship between the Guard and their Emperor was always sensitive . Bribing the Guard is a common theme in Imperial history . Sejanus almost took over the running of the Empire , before Tiberius overcame , and later executed him . A number of Emperors were murdered or otherwise deposed by the Guard , or with their knowledge . The first was Caligula .

Oceanic crust is the part of Earth 's lithosphere that is under the ocean basins .
Oceanic crust is primarily composed of mafic rocks , or sima . It is thinner than continental crust , or sial , generally less than 10 kilometers thick , however it is more dense , having a mean density of about 3.3 g\/cm3 .
Oceanic crust generally does not last longer than 200 million years . It is continuously being created at oceanic ridges . At these ridges , hot magma rises into the crust and cools , pushing the crust apart at the ridge . The continuous formation of new oceanic crust pushes the older crust away from the mid-ocean ridge . As it moves away from the ridge , the crust becomes cooler and denser , while the sediment may build on top of it .

Bluetooth is a protocol for Wireless communication . Devices such as mobile phones , laptops , PCs , printers , digital cameras , and video game console can connect to each other , and exchange information . This is done using radio waves . It can be done securely . Originally , Bluetooth was developed to reduce the number of cables needed to connect such devices to a PC . Bluetooth is only used for relatively short distances , like a few metres .
There are different standards . Data rates vary . Currently , they are at 1-3 MBit per second . Typical bluetooth applications are to connect a headset to a mobile phone , or to connect a computer mouse , keyboard or printer .
Bluetooth devices use the ISM Band around 2.4 GHz . This can be used worldwide , without the need to pay license fees , but many other devices , like DECT telephones -LRB- wireless phones -RRB- , smart tags with RFID , baby phones use it too . Bluetooth uses the same bands as some WLANs , but the modulation technique is different . Bluetooth uses Frequency-hopping spread spectrum .
There are many situations today where either Bluetooth or Wireless LANs can be used . Examples include setting up networks , printing or transferring files and data from a PDA to a computer . Both are versions of unlicensed wireless technology . WLANs can span bigger distances and offer higher throughput . Bluetooth does not require expensive hardware . It also needs less power to operate .
Both use the same frequency range , but their modulation techniques are different . Both have been developed to replace cabling . Bluetooth wanted to get rid of the printer cable , WLANs wanted to get rid of the cables needed to set up a LAN .
Bluetooth exists in many products , such as telephones , the Wii or PlayStation 3 . It has recently been built into some high definition watches , modems and headsets . The technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other in low-bandwidth situations . Bluetooth is commonly used to transfer sound data with telephones -LRB- i.e. with a Bluetooth headset -RRB- or byte data with hand-held computers -LRB- transferring files -RRB- .
Bluetooth uses protocols that make it easy to discover devices that are nearby , and to set up a connection between these devices . Bluetooth devices can advertise all the services they offer . Using services becomes easier , a lot of the setup related to security , networking or permissions is automatic .
WLANs are more like traditional LANs . More configuration is needed to setup the network , and to make resources accessible by other devices in the network . WLAN devices also consume more power than Bluetooth ones . Sometimes WLANs are called wireless Ethernet . WLAN needs more resources to be set up , but it also offers faster transfer speeds . The security is also better than that offered by Bluetooth .

Libya is a country that lies between the countries of Egypt , Sudan , Chad , Algeria , Niger , and Tunisia . To its north is the Mediterranean Sea . The capital of Libya is Tripoli , which is a port on the sea .
The population of Libya is about 5.5 million . This is not a large number for a country that has a large area , so the population density of Libya is low . This is because much of Libya is in the Sahara Desert . People from Libya are called Libyans . Most of them live near the coast .
Libya gets nearly all of its money from producing oil . Its economy is growing fast .
The money of Libya is called the Libyan dinar .
Libyans are mostly Arabs , though many are of a people called Berbers . Most Libyans are Sunni Muslims .
The full official name of Libya is `` Al Jumahiriyah al Arabiyah al Libiyah ash Shabiyah al Ishtirakiyah al Uzma '' .

The system is a combination of socialism and Islam derived in part from tribal practices and is supposed to be implemented by the Libyan people themselves in a unique form of `` direct democracy . '' -LRB- See details below . -RRB-
Qadhafi used oil funds during the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology outside Libya , supporting subversives and terrorists abroad to hasten the end of Marxism and capitalism . Beginning in 1973 , he also engaged in military operations in northern Chad 's Aozou Strip to gain access to minerals and to create a base of influence in Chadian politics ; he was forced to retreat in 1987 .
UN sanctions in 1992 isolated Qadhafi politically following his downing of Pan AM Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland . Libyan support for terrorism decreased after the sanctions .

UN sanctions were suspended in April 1999 and permanently lifted in September 2003 after Libya resolved the Lockerbie matter .
In December 2003 , Qadhafi announced that he had agreed to reveal and end its programs to develop weapons of mass destruction , and has made thereafter significant strides in normalizing relations with western nations . He has received various Western European leaders as well as many working-level and commercial delegations , and made his first trip to Western Europe in 15 years when he traveled to Brussels in April 2004 . In 2004 Qadhafi resolved several outstanding cases against his government for terrorist activities in the 1980s by compensating the families of victims of the UTA and La Belle disco bombings .
In the early 1970s , Qadhafi began to synthesize and expand his ideas of Arab unity , independence , economic egalitarianism , and cultural authenticity into the Third Universal Theory . The importance of this new theory to the regime was shown by the creation of the Higher Council for National Guidance on September 10 , 1972 . The council comprised the RCC chairman ; the ASU secretary general ; the minister of education ; the minister of information and culture ; the minister of youth and social affairs ; the minister of planning , the University of Libya 's president ; the administrative chairmen of religious endowments ; the Muslim Call Society chairman , and the ASU secretary of thought and culture .
The Higher Council for National Guidance was created to disseminate and implement Qadhafi 's Third Universal Theory -LRB- also seen as the Third International Theory or simply the Third Theory -RRB- . The Third Universal Theory was predicated on the belief that the two dominant socio-politico-economic ideologies -- capitalism and communism -- had been proved invalid . According to the theory , capitalism placed the good of a few individuals ahead of that of the community as a whole ; communism so emphasized the community that individual development was stifled . Nations constituting what is commonly referred to as the Third World were caught between proponents of the two ideologies : the United States and the Soviet Union , both of which , according to Qadhafi , were `` imperialist states which seek to achieve their ambitions by extending their zones of influence . ''
Qadhafi proclaimed that the Third Universal Theory , because it was based on the Quran , predated capitalism and communism . Furthermore , it offered an alternative . It rejected the class exploitation of capitalism and the class warfare of communism , finding that , in practice at least , systems based on both ideologies were dominated by a small elite . According to the Third Universal Theory , classes were an artificial colonial import . Far from building a system that rested on some form of class relations , the theory sought to eliminate class differences . It embodied the Islamic principle of consultation -LRB- shura -RRB- , by which community or even national affairs would be conducted through mutual consultation in which the views of all citizens were exchanged . This principle was manifested later in Libya in the creation of people 's committees and popular congresses .
The Third Universal Theory was an attempt to establish a philosophical grounding , based on Islam , for positive neutrality on the part of Third World nations . Under the theory , Third World states could coexist with the United States and the Soviet Union , and they could enter into agreements with them for their own purposes . But Third World states in general and Arab states in particular should not fall under the dominance of either of the two ideological , imperialist superpowers . In dividing the world between the two superpowers and their supposed prey , the Third Universaal Theory anticipated much of what has come to be called the North-South interpretation of international relations , whereby the world is divided into natural-resource-consuming nations -LRB- the industrialized North -RRB- and the natural-resource-producing nations -LRB- the underdeveloped South -RRB- . Indeed , Qadhafi has championed this interpretation of international relations . Guided by this viewpoint , Libya has been a strong supporter of national liberation movements against colonial regimes , even though the terrorist tactics used by some groups have tarnished Libya 's international reputation and led to economic sanctions and to military attacks in mid-1986 .
Central to the Third Universal Theory are the concepts of religion and nationalism as embodied in Islam . Qadhafi believes that religion and nationalism have been the `` two paramount drives that moved forward the evolutionary process . They constitute man 's history as they have formed nations , peoples , wars . '' In short , Qadhafi believes that religion determines human actions and interactions .
The perceived atheism of the communists is another reason Qadhafi finds their ideology invalid . According to Qadhafi , communists can not be trusted because they fear no ultimate judgment and thus may break their word if they consider it beneficial in any particular case .
According to Qadhafi , if religion is basic to the individual , nationalism is basic to the society . The Quran refers to tribes and nations that are inherent in the universe . A person belongs to a nationality upon birth . Only later does he or she become a conscious member of a religion . Thus , Qadhafi faults those who deny the validity of nationality . His concept of nationality , therefore , relates to his concept of Arab unity .
In this regard , Qadhafi adheres to the traditional , secularly based view of Arab nationalism propounded by such thinkers as Michel Aflaq , a founder and key political philosopher of the Baath Party , and Nasser . For Qadhafi , nationalism takes precedence over religion . In a wide-ranging speech before the GPC meeting in Sabha on March 2 , 1987 , Qadhafi denounced Islamic fundamentalism as `` nonsense '' and stated that `` no banner should be hoisted over the Arab homeland except the banner of pan-Arabism .

Oregon is a state in the United States . Salem is the capital -LRB- where most of the state government works -RRB- , and Portland is the city with the most people . Oregon was the 33rd state to join the United States , in 1859 .
The state of Washington is to the north of Oregon , and California and Nevada are to its south . The state of Idaho is to the east , and the Pacific Ocean is to the west .
The Columbia River flows along most of the border with Washington . The Snake River flows along much of the border with Idaho . The highest mountain is Mount Hood -LRB- 11,237 feet , or 3,426 metres -RRB- , part of the Cascade Range of mountains . Another famous Cascade Mountain in Oregon is Mount Mazama , better known as Crater Lake .
Oregon was a long way from the United States of America , which was east of the Mississippi in the 1830s and 1840s . To get to Oregon , many settlers had to cross the Great Plains , which were empty except for a few forts and Indians . Most people thought that it was impossible to farm there . They called it the `` Great American Desert '' , because crossing it was long and dangerous ; however , thousands did , anyway .
Mountain men had found a pass way over the Rocky Mountains , and they named it the South Past . This path helped many wagons to reach the west coast . In 1836 a missionary named Marcus Whitman crossed through the pass with his wife to Oregon . This made proof that it was possible for others with women and families to go too , and because of this , suddenly Oregon became the place pioneers wanted to make a trip to .
Most of the settlers that came by the Oregon Trail had a very difficult trip . The Trail began in Missouri , and they went in covered wagons . They could only travel 100 miles in one week , and so the whole trip would take half a year . But still , lots of pioneers traveled so much that it is still available to see the wagon ruts in some places today .
Life on the trail was very hard for the pioneers . Every day , they would break up and camp , travel all day , and set up camp again . Food was usually beans and coffee , for every single days . The travelers always searched for water , wood for fires , and something to catch and eat fresh . But these were hard to find , and so sometimes they got mad at each other and fought with fists and guns .
The Trail was also dangerous . Rivers would flood , washing away people and other things . Indians may attack , oxen or horses could die , and diseases and injuries would strike .
By 1840 , due to all the hard work of the pioneers , there were thousands of Americans in Oregon . Towns and farms had been set up . But the British , however , only had a few hundred settlers in Oregon . Because of this , the Americans began to plan to take over the whole land .
Many Americans wanted this as well . They made up the slogan , `` Fifty-four Forty or Fight ! '' and wanted all of Oregon up to latitude 54 celcius forty or they would go to war with Britain to get it . They were so eager to have Oregon all for themselves , they supported James Polk as president because he claimed to have similar thoughts with them as well .
However , after President Polk was elected , he began to be more sensible . He did not want to wage war with Britain , if it could be avoided . The British also realized that the Americans would soon have enough settlers in Oregon to easily drive out the British defenders . In 1846 the British offered to divide Oregon by giving most of the border between the USA and Canada . President Polk accepted this , and so now the Americans had power over Oregon as well as the other countries .
There are a number of colleges and universities in Oregon . The four-year universities with the most students are Portland State University , Oregon State University , and the University of Oregon .

Guarana or GuaranÃ -LRB- , -LRB- guÌ a. É 3\/4 a. ` na -RRB- or -LRB- guÌ a. É a. ` na -RRB- -RRB- , Paullinia cupana -LRB- syn . P. crysan , P. sorbilis -RRB- , is a shrub or small tree in the Sapindaceae family . It is native to Venezuela and northern Brazil . The seed of the GuaranÃ fruit is a stimulant with thermogenic and diuretic properties .
The guaranÃ fruit 's color ranges from orange to red and contain black seeds which are partly covered by white arils . The color contrast when the fruit has been split open has been likened to eyeballs ; this has formed the basis of a myth -LRB- see below -RRB- .
GuaranÃ plays an important role in Tupi and GuaranÃ Brazilian culture . The name ` guaranÃ ' is derived from the Tupi-Guarani word wara ` nÃ . These tribes believed , it was magical , a cure for bowel complaints and a way to regain strength . They also tell the myth of a ` Divine Child ' that was killed by a serpent and whose eyes gave birth to this plant .
GuaranÃ is mainly used as an ingredient in soft drinks and energy drinks . It is also used as a dietary supplement , generally to promote weight loss . In addition , it may be an ingredient in other foods .
In addition to other chemicals , the guaranÃ plant contains caffeine -LRB- sometimes called `` guaranine '' -RRB- , theophylline , and theobromine . Water extracts of the guarana plant are central nervous system stimulants due to the content of these alkaloids . Energy drink manufacturers typically add synthetic caffeine or caffeine derived from coffee decaffeination , though many advertise `` natural '' caffeine from the seeds of guaranÃ .
Brazil produces several brands of soft drink from guaranÃ extract that contain no added caffeine . Each differs greatly in flavor ; some have only a slight guaranÃ fruit taste . In Brazil , sales of guaranÃ drinks are even greater than that of cola drinks . They are typically fizzy and sweet , with a very fruity aftertaste . Most guaranÃ drinks are produced in Brazil and consumed locally or in nearby countries , such as Paraguay . Major brands include GuaranÃ Antarctica , GuaranÃ Schin from Schincariol and GuaranÃ Brahma from AmBev , Kuat , and GuaranÃ Jesus , a local Brazilian brand named for the druggist that formulated it . Many local producers also create drinks not for export .
Studies involving guaranÃ show benefits to cognitive function . They have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration -LRB- FDA -RRB- or any similar government agencies . In the United States , guaranÃ holds a GRAS-status , i.e. generally regarded as safe and must be labeled as not intended to diagnose , treat , cure or prevent any disease .
The Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics published a study in June 2001 . This study shows an average 11.2 pound weight loss in a group taking a mixture of yerba mate , guaranÃ and damiana , compared to an average 1 pound loss in a placebo group after 45 days .
A university study in Brazil of guaranÃ extract showed a platelet aggregation decrease of up to 37 % of control values and a decrease of platelet thromboxane formation from arachidonic acid of up to 78 % of control values . This study may be significant to stroke and heart attack risk reduction because when excess thromboxane formation occurs , an arterial blood clot can develop , resulting in a heart attack or ischemic stroke .
A separate 1997 study of guaranÃ 's effects on the physical activity of rats showed increased memory retention and physical endurance when compared with a placebo .
Although side-effects of guaranÃ are rare , drugs.com recommends , `` When considering the use of herbal supplements , consultation with a primary health care professional is advisable . Additionally , consultation with a practitioner trained in the uses of herbal\/health supplements may be beneficial , and coordination of treatment among all health care providers involved may be advantageous '' . Drugs.com also advises not to mix guaranÃ with ephedrine .
GuaranÃ seeds consist of mostly reddish vegetable fiber and resin with a small amount of oil and water . Guarana contains different amounts of caffeine , theobromine , theophylline and other alkaloids , compared to coffee , tea , mate , or cocoa .

In physics , work is the amount of energy transferred by a force .
Like energy , it is a scalar quantity , with SI units of joules . Heat conduction is not considered to be a form of work , since there is no macroscopically measurable force , only microscopic forces occurring in atomic collisions . The term work was created in the 1830s by the French mathematician Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis .
where m is the mass of the object and v is the object 's velocity .
If the force and the displacement are in the same direction , the work is positive . If the force and the displacement are in opposite directions the work is negative .
The Little Ice Age -LRB- LIA -RRB- was a period of cooling after a warmer era that is known as the Medieval Warm Period .
Climatologists and historians find it difficult to agree on either the start or end dates of this period . Some confine the Little Ice Age to approximately the 16th century to the mid 19th century . It is generally agreed that there were three minima , beginning about 1650 , about 1770 , and 1850 , each separated by slight warming intervals . It was initially believed that the LIA was a global phenomenon ; it is now less clear if this is true .
During the period 1645 â `` 1715 , in the middle of the Little Ice Age , there was a period of low solar activity known as the Maunder Minimum . The physical link between low sunspot activity and cooling temperatures has not been established , but the coincidence of the Maunder Minimum with the deepest trough of the Little Ice Age is suggestive of such a connection . The SpÃ rer Minimum has also been identified with a significant cooling period near the beginning of the Little Ice Age . Other indicators of low solar activity during this period are levels of the isotopes carbon-14 and beryllium-10 .
Throughout the Little Ice Age , the world also experienced heightened volcanic activity . When a volcano erupts , its ash reaches high into the atmosphere and can spread to cover the whole of Earth . This ash cloud blocks out some of the incoming solar radiation , leading to worldwide cooling that can last up to two years after an eruption .
Another possibility is that there was a shutdown or slowing of Thermohaline circulation , also known as the `` great ocean conveyor '' or `` meridional overturning circulation '' . The Gulf Stream could have been interrupted by the introduction of a large amount of fresh water to the North Atlantic , possibly caused by a period of warming before the little ice age . There is some concern that shutdown of thermohaline circulation could happen again as a result of global warming .
Beginning around 1850 , the climate began warming and the Little Ice Age ended . Some global warming critics believe that Earth 's climate is still recovering from the Little Ice Age and that human activity is not the decisive factor in present temperature trends , but this idea is not widely accepted .

WWE SmackDown is a professional wrestling television program for WWE . Currently it is the only television broadcast for the SmackDown ! brand . From its launch in 1999 , SmackDown ! was shown on Thursday nights , but as of September 9 2005 , the show moved to Friday nights . To reflect this change , the show is now known to as Friday Night SmackDown ! . The SmackDown ! brand is currently one of WWE 's two brands , the other being Raw .
Its currently shown in the United States on MyNetworkTV , in Canada on The Score Network and on E ! 
SmackDown ! was first seen on April 29 , 1999 as a single television special on UPN . On August 26 , 1999 , SmackDown ! officially started on UPN , in Kansas City , Missouri . Like WCW Thunder , SmackDown ! was recorded on Tuesdays and then broadcast on Thursdays . The new WWF show was so popular that WCW moved Thunder to Wednesdays in the hope of holding on to fans rather than losing them to WWF . SmackDown ! , like Thunder , made heavy use of the color blue , earning it the nickname `` The Blue Show '' amongst wrestling fans .
The first SmackDown ! set was different as it had an oval-shaped TitanTron -LRB- which was dubbed the `` OvalTron '' -RRB- , entrance and stage which made it stand out from the RAW set and its rectangular TitanTrons . An added feature to the first set was the ability for the OvalTron to be moved to either the left or right of the stage . Throughout the show 's early existence , top WWF superstar The Rock routinely called SmackDown ! `` his '' show , in reference to the fact that the name was derived from one of his catchphrases , `` Laying the smackdown . '' In August 2001 , as part of celebrating SmackDown ! s second anniversary , the show got a new logo and set . The last SmackDown ! to use the previous television set saw Alliance member Rhyno Gore WWF member Chris Jericho through the center screen , destroying part of the set .
In early to mid-2002 , WWE had a process they called the `` Brand Extension '' . WWE divided itself into two `` de facto '' wrestling promotions with separate rosters , storylines and authority figures . RAW and SmackDown ! would host each division , give its name to the division and essentially compete against each other . The split was a result of WWF purchasing their two biggest competitors , WCW and ECW . The brand extension was publicly announced during a telecast of WWF RAW on March 25 2002 , and became official the next day .
Wrestlers now would become show-exclusive , wrestling for their specific show only . At the time this excluded the WWE Undisputed Championship and WWE Women 's Championship , as those WWE titles would be defended on both shows . In August 2002 , WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar refused to defend the title on RAW , in effect causing his title to become exclusive to SmackDown ! The following week on RAW , General Manager Eric Bischoff awarded a newly instated World Heavyweight Championship to RAW 's designated # 1 contender , Triple H. Due to the fact that since the WWE Undisputed Championship was now SmackDown ! exclusive it was no longer seen as `` Undisputed '' . Following this , the WWE Women 's Championship soon became RAW-exclusive as well . As a result of the Brand Extension , an annual `` draft lottery '' was instituted to exchange members of each roster and generally refresh the lineups .
On June 6 2005 , WWE Champion John Cena switched brands from SmackDown ! to RAW as part of the month-long Draft Lottery . This effectively left SmackDown ! without a World Title . During this time , United States Champion Orlando Jordan was billed as the top champion on the show . On June 23 2005 , in Tucson , SmackDown ! General Manager Theodore Long announced a six-man elimination match between John `` Bradshaw '' Layfield , Booker T , Chris Benoit , The Undertaker , Christian -LRB- replacing The Big Show , who was picked by RAW in the lottery -RRB- , and Muhammad Hassan to crown the first SmackDown ! Champion . On the June 30 episode of SmackDown ! , JBL won the match . Long appeared afterward and stated that even though JBL had won the match , SmackDown ! did not need a Championship anymore . Batista , the World Heavyweight Champion , entered the ring as SmackDown ! 's final draft lottery pick . Long also showm that JBL was the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship .
It was possible that WWE 's `` lame duck '' status with Viacom on Spike TV is what prompted its moving SmackDown ! to the Friday night death slot for the Fall 2005 season . However , it worked out for both parties involved , as the show did better in the ratings than it had on Thursdays , while UPN got much better ratings on Fridays than it did before , with its movie night . Also , UPN had been able to hold on to the ratings from Thursday nights , most notably with comedian Chris Rock 's Wonder Years-like sitcom Everybody Hates Chris . In January 2006 , prior to the announcement of the CW Network , it was announced that UPN had renewed SmackDown ! for two more years .
Following the cancellation of Star Trek : Enterprise , SmackDown ! was renamed Friday Night SmackDown ! and moved into Enterprises old timeslot in the United States . WWE promoted this move with the tagline `` TV that 's changing Friday nights . '' Friday Night SmackDown ! made its start on September 9 2005 . The program still aired on Thursdays in Canada on the Score . In the United Kingdom and Australia , their stations Sky Sports and FOX8 air SmackDown ! on Fridays before the United States due to the time difference . This is the first time a major weekly WWE show airs internationally before it hits screens in the U.S.
The events of Hurricane Katrina affected the first version of Friday Night SmackDown ! in the U.S. due to a special fundraising concert -LRB- see Shelter From the Storm : A Concert for the Gulf Coast -RRB- that was shown on UPN at the same time that the first version would have been shown , resulting in only the second hour of the show being shown on UPN . The first hour was instead streamed from WWE 's website . Other countries , including Canada , United Kingdom , Australia and the Philippines received the full two-hour show . WWOR-TV -LRB- My 9 , New York , New York -RRB- also aired both hours of the show on tape delay on Saturday , due to a previous commitment to broadcast the New York Yankees on Friday nights .
At the SmackDown ! taping on January 10 2006 , Batista had to forfeit the World Heavyweight Championship because of a triceps injury . Theodore Long made a Battle Royal for the vacant title . The winner was at the time RAW superstar Kurt Angle , who later switched to the SmackDown ! brand . In a break from their traditional role of acting as if SmackDown ! is not pre-recorded , WWE.com had a photograph of Angle holding his new title on the main page . WWE also did this when Edge cashed in his Money in the Bank contract to win the World Heavyweight Championship from The Undertaker and when The Great Khali won a battle royal after Edge 's injury .
On the April 7 2006 version of SmackDown ! , general manager Theodore Long said that the King of the Ring tournament would return after a four year hiatus as a SmackDown ! - exclusive tournament . The tournament ended at Judgment Day 2006 with Booker T as the winner , defeating Bobby Lashley in the final .
On June 9 2006 , Tazz left the SmackDown ! brand to join the new ECW brand , leaving the color commentator position on SmackDown ! vacant . However , on June 11 at One Night Stand 2006 , JBL revealed that he would be the new color commentator for SmackDown ! He stayed in that position until December 2007 when he left SmackDown ! to become an in-ring competitor on RAW . Jonathan Coachman replaced him afterwards .
On September 22 2006 , Friday Night SmackDown ! was started on the The CW Television Network , a joint venture between CBS Corporation , owner of UPN , and Warner Bros. . Entertainment , a subsidiary of Time Warner , majority owner of The WB .
For four weeks before the official start -LRB- and in preparation for the impending removal of UPN in several markets by the start of MyNetworkTV on September 5 2006 -RRB- of Friday Night SmackDown ! on the CW on September 22 2006 , Tribune Broadcasting television stations in six major markets -LRB- including WPIX in New York City and KTLA in Los Angeles -RRB- aired WWE 's Friday Night SmackDown ! early in September 2006 . Two other future affiliates of The CW , WCWJ in Jacksonville , Florida and WIWB in Green Bay , Wisconsin , also aired SmackDown ! in early September as well .
The transition to the CW caused an interruption in the broadcast of SmackDown ! in the state of Utah beginning in June when KPNZ in Salt Lake City stopped airing all UPN programs early . The show is now seen on KUCW . In Hawaii , SmackDown ! returned in late 2006 , airing on a CW digital subchannel of Honolulu 's FOX affiliate KHON -LRB- Channel 2 -RRB- , which has received statewide carriage over Oceanic Time Warner Cable . Since the move to the CW Network , Friday Night SmackDown ! has shown a major increase in ratings now averaging a 3.0 national rating . In addition , SmackDown ! has become the second highest watched program on The CW .
On April 20 2007 , SmackDown ! celebrated its 400th episode . Ratings success soon followed . On June 8 2007 , Friday Night SmackDown ! made CW history by making a three-way tie with CBS and ABC in the key ad demographic , adults 18-49 by drawing a 1.5 rating each . On June 22 2007 , Friday Night SmackDown ! again made CW history by tying the network for first place in the key ad demographic , adults 18-49 , and being the second most watched network program at 9 p.m. for the night . The CW had not performed as well at any time slot since America 's Next Top Model in March 2007 . The next week on June 29 2007 , Friday Night SmackDown ! helped The CW claim the top spot in the key demographic , Adults 18-49 for Friday . CBS got the overall lead but The CW got top spot for the Adults 18-49 by registering a 1.4 rating followed by CBS and NBC at 1.3 , ABC at 1.2 , and FOX at 0.9 . Then on Friday , July 13 2007 , Friday Night SmackDown ! made network history by placing first in the 18-49 demographic and becoming the most watched show at the 9 p.m. hour on network television . This is the first time anything has placed this well on The CW . SmackDown ! became a hit show on Friday nights winning the demographics for young males , and ranking second on the demographics -LRB- 18-49 -RRB- for Friday nights .
On October 16 2007 it was said that the SmackDown ! and ECW brands would begin a `` talent exchange '' , allowing their respective talent to appear and compete on either brand .
On February 8 2008 it was reported that World Wrestling Entertainment and The CW had ended agreements to keep Friday Night SmackDown ! on the network . WWE stated that agreements with other networks has begun and that Friday Night SmackDown ! would continue to air on The CW through the end of the 2007-2008 broadcast season . On February 26 WWE issued a press release saying Friday Night SmackDown ! s move to MyNetworkTV .

Wolfgang Wagner -LRB- born 30 August 1919 - 21 March 2010 -RRB- was a German opera director . He was the grandson of the opera composer Richard Wagner and great-grandson of the composer Franz Liszt . For 42 years he was director of the Bayreuth Festival , which was created by Richard Wagner for the performances of his operas . At first he was director together with his brother Wieland . After Wieland died he continued to be director until he retired in 2008 . He tried to get rid of the festivalâ s Nazi past , and put on productions which were very symbolic : using lighting effects instead of complicated scenery and heavy costumes .
Wagner was born in Bayreuth . His mother , Winifred Wagner -LRB- born Williams-Klindworth -RRB- , was English . She married Richard Wagnerâ s son Siegfried , who was much older than she was . Although Siegfried was gay they had two sons -LRB- Wieland and Wolfgang -RRB- and two daughters .
When Siegfried died in 1930 Winifred took over the running of the festival . She was friends with Adolf Hitler who often came to the performances . Hitler became a family friend . The children called him â Uncle Adolfâ or â Uncle Wolfâ -LRB- his nickname -RRB- . When World War II started , Wieland did not have to fight in the army because Hitler said he was too important for German culture . However , Wolfgang had to fight , and he was wounded in Poland , but got better . He started to produce operas in Berlin . Hitler liked him , but he never joined the Nazi party .
During the war a lot of Bayreuth buildings were damaged , but not the theater . The Americans used it for religious services . After the war Winifred was not allowed to run the opera house because of her Nazi past , but Wieland became director and Wolfgang looked after the money . The two brothers started the festival again in 1951 . They formed the orchestra again , and invited Hans Knappertsbusch and Herbert von Karajan to conduct . They deliberately avoided using lots of scenery and made use of symbolic ideas , especially lighting .
When Wieland died in 1966 Wolfgang was the only director . He continued the modern ideas of his brother , using very simple staging techniques . The production of Wagnerâ s Ring Cycle in 1976 by the opera director Patrice ChÃ reau was particularly important . Many people loved it , others disagreed with it . The production of the Ring Cycle in 1983 by Peter Hall , conducted by Georg Solti celebrated the 100th birthday of Richard Wagner . People argued about this production , too . Since then , many famous people have visited the festival , including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the German President Horst KÃ hler . In 1982 Grace Bumbry was the first black person to sing at the festival -LRB- she sang the part of Venus in TannhÃ user . Some of the audience thought this was shocking , but she sang so beautifully that everyone applauded for 30 minutes . She had to take 42 curtain calls .
Wolfgang married twice . His first wife was Ellen Drexel . He had two children by this marriage . He argued with them . His son did not like the familyâ s past Nazi connections , and the daughter Eva argued about the control of the festival . Wolfgang later married Gudrun Mack , with whom he had a daughter Katharina . Eva and Katharina now run the festival .
Wolfgang died aged 90 in Bayreuth in 2010 .

The Isle of Youth -LRB- Spanish : Isla de la Juventud -RRB- is the largest Cuban island after Cuba itself . It is the sixth-largest island in the West Indies . The island has an area 3056 kmÂ -LRB- 1180 square miles -RRB- and is 100 km to the southwest of mainland Cuba . It lies across the Gulf of BatabanÃ . The island lies almost directly south of Havana and Pinar del RÃ o. Because of its superficial extension , population and for its economic characteristics , it is considered to be a Special Municipality . It is therefore not a part of any province . The Isle of Youth is administered directly by the central government of Cuba .
The island is the largest of the 350 in the Canarreos Archipelago -LRB- ArchipiÃ lago de los Canarreos -RRB- . It has an estimated population of 100,000 . The capital and largest city is Nueva Gerona in the north . The second-largest and oldest city is Santa Fe in the interior . Other communities are Columbia , Mac Kinley , Santa BÃ rbara , Cuchilla Alta , Punta del Este , Sierra de Caballos and Sierra de Casas . The island was called the Isle of Pines -LRB- Isla de Pinos -RRB- before 1978 .
Little is known of the pre-Columbian history of the island , though a cave complex near the Punta del Este beach preserves 235 ancient drawings made by the native population . The island first became known to Europeans during Christopher Columbus 's third voyage to the New World in 1494 . Columbus named the island La Evangelista and claimed it for Spain ; the island would also come to be known Isla de Cotorras -LRB- `` Isle of Parrots '' -RRB- and Isla de Tesoros -LRB- `` Treasure Island '' -RRB- at various points in its history .
Pirate activity in and around the area left its trace in English literature . Both Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson and Peter Pan by James Matthew Barrie are rooted in part on accounts of the island and its native and pirate inhabitants , as well as long dugout canoes -LRB- which were often used by pirates as well as indigenous peoples -RRB- and the great American crocodile -LRB- Crocodylus acutus -RRB- on the island .
Following the victory of the United States in the Spanish-American War , Spain dropped all claims to Cuba under the terms of the 1898 Treaty of Paris . The Isla de la Juventud was not mentioned in the Platt Amendment , which defined Cuba 's boundaries , and this led to competing claims to the island by the United States and the now-independent Cuba . In 1907 , the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the island did not belong to the United States . A treaty was signed between the U.S. and Cuba in 1925 , recognizing Cuban ownership .
Much of the island is covered with pine forests . These are the source of the island 's large lumber industry . The northern region of the island has low ridges from which marble is quarried . The southern region is an elevated plain . Agriculture and fishing are the island 's main industries , with citrus fruit and vegetables being grown . A black sand beach was formed by volcanic activity .
The island has a mild climate , but is known for frequent hurricanes . It is a popular tourist destination , with many beaches and resorts , including Bibijagua Beach . Until the Cuban government expropriated all foreign-owned property in the early 1960s , much land was owned by Americans .
The main transportation to the island is by boat or aircraft . Hydrofoils -LRB- kometas -RRB- and motorized catamarans will make the trip in between two and three hours . A much slower and larger cargo ferry takes around six hours to make the crossing , but is cheaper . The province has only one municipality , also named Isla de la Juventud .
From 1953 to 1955 , Cuban leader Fidel Castro was imprisoned in the Presidio Modelo on the Isla de la Juventud by the regime of Fulgencio Batista after leading the failed July 1953 attack on the Moncada Barracks in the Oriente Province . Later , Castro used the same facility to imprison counterrevolutionaries and dissidents , such as Huber Matos -LRB- once a comandante of rebel troops supporting the Cuban Revolution but later came into conflict with Cuban government -RRB- , who claims to have been tortured there , and Armando F. Valladares .
Presidio Modelo is now closed , and turned into a museum . It is replaced by more modern prisons . These include -LRB- MAS = maximum security prison ; COR = correctional -RRB- :
Genki Nakayama -LRB- born 15 September 1981 -RRB- is a Japanese football player . He plays for Shonan Bellmare .
The nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products makes people dependent . When they quit , they will get withdrawal symptoms . Nicotine replacement therapy -LRB- NRT -RRB- is there to reduce the dependency symptoms . This is usually done by delivering nicotine -LRB- or a substance very similar to it -RRB- in other ways . Common methods include nicotine patches and chewing gums with nicotine in them .
Cigarettes are responsible for the deaths of about 5 million people each year . These people are not killed by the nicotine in the cigarette , but by other substances in tobacco smoke such as Carbon Monoxide and tars .
NRT delivers nicotine to the smoker 's brain in a much slower way than cigarettes do . It helps to damp down the urges to smoke that most smokers have in the early days and weeks after quitting , rather than remove them totally . It gives the smoker the chance to break smoking cues in their daily lives , and might provide a more comfortable exit from the smoking habit . NRT however is best used with some form of support , ideally from someone who knows something about smoking cessation .
In 2005 the Committee on the Safety of Medicines recommended that NRT be given to pregnant smokers and also to adolescent smokers .
Findings from a recent Cochrane review of controlled trials testing NRT products -LRB- Stead et al . 2008 -RRB- indicated that smokers using NRT were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to be abstinent from smoking at followup than those in the placebo or control treatment condition .
Nicotine is the addictive drug in tobacco products , so there is a chance when using NRT products , to become addicted to those products in place of the tobacco habit . Generally it is argued that NRT products are safer then smoking tobacco . NRT products are generally expensive , sometimes even more so then cigarettes , so a minority of people may become addicted to the NRT product and turn back to tobacco products to save money .
An electronic cigarette -LRB- also called e-cigarette and e-cig -RRB- , is an electronic item used instead of cigarettes . It gives a little nicotine when you breathe through it .

Schinz was also curator of the Natural History Society of Zurich . He also wrote a lot of important zoological books between 1824 and 1852 . These included Das Thierreich -LRB- 1821-4 -RRB- , Naturgeschichte und Abbildungen der Reptilien -LRB- 1833-4 -RRB- , and EuropÃ sche Fauna -LRB- 1840 -RRB- .

The guitar is a string instrument which is played by plucking the strings . The main parts of a guitar are the body , the fretboard , the headstock and the strings . Guitars are usually made from wood or plastic . Their strings are made of steel or nylon . The guitar strings are plucked with the fingers of the right hand -LRB- or left hand , for left handed players -RRB- , or a small pick made of thin plastic . This type of pick is called a `` plectrum '' or guitar pick . The left hand holds the neck of the guitar while the fingers press the strings to the fretboard . Different finger positions on the fretboard make different notes .
Guitar-like plucked string instruments have been used for many years . In many countries and at many different time periods , guitars and other plucked string instruments have been very popular , because they are light to carry from place to place , they are easier to learn to play than many other instruments . Guitars are used for many types of music , from Classical to Rock . Most pieces of popular music that have been written since the 1950s are written with guitars .
There are many different types of guitars , classified on how they are made and the type of music they are used for . All traditional types of guitar have a body which is hollow . This makes the sound of the strings louder , and gives the guitar its quality . This type of guitar is called `` acoustic '' . -LRB- An acoustic instrument is one that makes its own dynamics . -RRB-
From the 1930s , people started making and playing guitars that used electricity and amplifiers to control the loudness . These guitars , which are often used in popular music , are called electric guitars . They do not need to have a hollow body . This is because they do not use acoustics to amplify the sound .
Most guitars have six strings , but there are also guitars with four , seven , eight , ten , or twelve strings . More strings make the instrument sound fuller . The neck of a guitar has bars or marks called frets . Frets help a guitarist know where to put his or her fingers to get the right pitch when playing .
The word guitar was adopted into English from Spanish word guitarra in the 1600s . In the Middle ages the word gitter or gittern was used in England . Both guitarra and gitter came from the Latin word cithara . The word cithara came from the earlier Greek word kithara . Kithara could have come from the Persian word sehtÄ r. seh meaning `` three '' and tÄ r meaning `` string '' . There is also a similar but two-stringed Persian instrument named dotÄ r. do means `` two '' in persian . The Indian sitar instrument was named after the Persian sehtÄ r. . The sihtar itself is related to the Indian instrument , the sitar .
A person who plays a guitar is called a guitarist . A person who makes or fixes guitars is a luthier , which comes from the word `` lute '' . The word `` lute '' , comes from the Arabic `` Al-Uud '' , a stringed instrument from the Middle East . The guitar appears to be derived from earlier instruments known in ancient central Asia as the Sitara . Instruments very similar to the guitar appear in ancient carvings and statues recovered from the old Iranian capitol of Susa . The modern word , guitar , was adopted into English from the Spanish word guitarra , which came from the older Greek word kithara . Possible sources for various names of musical instruments that guitar could be derived from appear to be a combination of two Indo-European roots : guit - , similar to Sanskrit sangeet meaning `` music '' , and - tar a widely found root meaning `` cord '' or `` string '' . The word guitar is a word that the Iberian Arabic language took from the Persian language . The word qitara is an Arabic name for various members of the lute family that preceded the Western guitar . The word guitarra was introduced into Spanish when such instruments were brought into Iberia by the Moors after the 10th century .
There have been instruments like the guitar for at least 5,000 years . The guitar may have come from older instruments known as the sitara from ancient India and central Asia . The oldest known picture of a guitar-like instrument is a 3300 year old stone carving of a Hittite bard . The oldest guitar-like instrument that is still complete is the `` Warwick Gittern '' in the British Museum . It belonged to Elizabeth I of England and probably to her father Henry VIII before it was given to her . It is about 500 years old .
The design of the modern guitar began with the Roman cithara . The cithara was brought by the Romans to Hispania -LRB- Spain -RRB- around 40 AD . In the 8th century the Moors brought the four-stringed oud into Spain . The introduction to the oud caused changes to the design of the cithara . AD . In other parts of Europe , the six-string Scandinavian lut -LRB- lute -RRB- became popular wherever the Vikings had been . By 1200 AD , there were two types of the four string `` guitar '' : the guitarra morisca -LRB- Moorish guitar -RRB- from Spain which had a rounded back , wide fingerboard and several soundholes , and the guitarra latina -LRB- Latin guitar -RRB- which was more like the modern guitar with one sound hole and a narrower neck .
The Spanish vihuela , of the 16th century , was another instrument similar to the guitar . It had lute-style tuning and a body that was like a guitar . The vihuela was only popular for a short amount of time . It is not known whether it was simply a design that combined features of the oud and lute or a transition from the Renaissance instrument to the modern guitar .
The Vinaccia family from Naples , Italy were famous mandolin makers . It is thought that they also made the oldest six-string guitar that still exists . There is a guitar built that was signed and dated 1779 on the label by Gaetano Vinaccia -LRB- 1759 - after 1831 -RRB- Although there are many fakes that have dates on them from that time , this guitar is believed by experts to be genuine -LRB- real -RRB- .
The guitar 's design was improved -LRB- made better -RRB- by the famous Spanish luthier , Antonio Torres Jurado -LRB- 1817-1892 -RRB- and by Louis Panormo of London .
The electric guitar was made by George Beauchamp in 1936 . Beauchamp co-founded a company called Rickenbacher to make guitars . However , Danelectro was the first to produce electric guitars for the public to use .
A guitar was described by Dr. Michael Kasha as an instrument that had `` a long , fretted neck , flat wooden soundboard , ribs , and a flat back , most often with incurved sides '' .
Modern guitars come in four main types . The classical guitar is used for classical music . The term acoustic guitar is generally used for a guitar used for popular music , even though a classical guitar is also an acoustic instrument . There are many other different types of acoustic guitars from different parts of the world .
A electric guitar can be flat , hollow , or semi-hollow -LRB- solid with hollow pockets on the sides -RRB- , and produces sound through its pickups , which are wire-wound magnets that are screwed onto the guitar . Some guitars combine the hollow acoustic body with amplified sound . Bass guitars are designed to make a low bass rhythm .
A special electric folding travel guitar called the Foldaxe -LRB- briefly manufactured by Hoyer in 1977 -RRB- was invented for Chet Atkins -LRB- in Atkins ' book `` Me and My Guitars '' -RRB- by inventor and guitarist Roger Field , featuring a built-in way to keep the string tension and tuning the same even when folded , and ready to play when unfolded . Atkins demonstrated his several times on US television , and also on The Today Show with Les Paul , who was with him as a guest .

Parlour -LRB- or parlor -RRB- , comes from the French word parloir , from parler , which means `` to speak '' . The parlor is a room in a house where people could meet . In Turkey it is called a kiosk . The Bible -LRB- Judges 3:20 -RRB- , talks about the `` summer parlor '' , a small room built on the roof of the house , with open windows to catch the breeze .

In medieval Christian usage , the parlor was one of two rooms in a monastery . The ` outer parlor ' was the room where the monks or nuns could meet a visitor and do business with people from outside the monastery . It was generally in the west range of the buildings of the cloister , close to the main entrance . The ` inner parlor ' was found off the cloister , next to the chapter house in the east range of the monastery . Most religious orders wanted silence in the cloister , which was the place where the monks studied . The inner parlor was a place where the monks could talk without disturbing the others in the cloister .
In modern use , the parlor is a formal sitting room in a large house or mansion . In the late 19th century , it was often a formal room used only on Sundays or special occasions , and closed during the week . The family kept their best furniture , works of art and other things on display in the parlor . The body of someone who died would be put on show in the parlor while funeral was being organized . During the 20th century , architects and decorators have changed the use of the room . In most homes the parlor has been replaced by the living room .

A demon or daemon is a bad or powerful being in many world religions . The word is also used for a type of computer program that does useful things in the background of a computer , but this use is not related to the religious meaning .
A demon is usually thought to be a supernatural creature that is a bad spirit . Demons are often described as being called by someone , and then working in a bad way . `` To demonize '' means to make someone appear evil .
In a few writings , there are also good demons , for example in stories by James Clerk Maxwell , Hesiod and Shakespeare . In Indo-European mythology and traditions of Iranian Avestan and Vedic , the idea of `` demons '' was there for many years . Ancient Egyptians thought of demons as `` monsters '' that ate souls of people when they went to the afterlife . In ancient Greek mythology , there are also daemons but they were thought to be invisible protectors that they believed protect them . In the book Northern Lights by Philip Pullman , a daemon is said to be a creature that everyone has as part of the body . So if it is far away from someone , that person would feel hurt .
In the Greek New Testament and Hebrew Old Testament , demons are said to be bad . In Hebrew , demons are called se ` irim . In other Hebrew writings , they do not come from heaven , but came from another world and made much troubles . They gave diseases too . And they have a prince who is not God , but a demon .

`` Monotheistic '' religions -LRB- that say there is one God -RRB- usually teach that demons are rebels and under God 's authority at all times . The English poet John Milton describes Satan as rebelling against God but losing , and being allowed to survive only by God 's grace . In some `` polytheistic '' religions , demons are equal to gods . In Hinduism , the demon-goddess Kali represents destruction and thus from a human standpoint is `` bad '' .
The grimoire -LRB- medieval book about magical beliefs -RRB- called Ars Goetia , writes about 72 demons that a king has called and put in a bronze container sealed by magical symbols . The demons had to do whatever the king said . This book is all about spirits and demons , good and evil , that were called by magic . The word ` demon ' has different meanings all over the world , but often there is the idea that they are spirits that lived in a place , or went with a person .
Christians believe that demons were bad angels that went to bad ways instead of good ways . Angels were like humans , God asked them if they wanted to stay with him , or to go away from him . Those angels who became demons because they wanted to go away , fought against God , who won the battle with Michael . God sent the bad demons into a prison called Hell and they could not see God now for the punishment . Those demons are called the fallen angels .
Some say that the demons go back to heaven after asking forgiveness of their bad doings . But others say they stay in that prison forever . The demons go into the prison also because of marrying a human woman , when they are not supposed to . The fictional Inuyasha has some demons marrying a human as well .
In InuYasha , a fictional manga , yokais -LRB- Japanese for supernatural creatures and translated demon in English -RRB- can not die easily , but humans do , and yokais get old more slowly than humans . They are also creatures that have supernatural powers and most of them are evil . A half-demon is a child made by human and a demon married together - so it 's half-demon and half-human .
A daemon is a type of program found in computers running operating systems based on Unix like Linux , BSD , and Mac OS X. -LRB- In Windows these programs are usually called `` services '' instead . -RRB- It usually starts when the computer starts , and does useful things . Some daemons start other programs after waiting until a certain time of day , or wait for you to ask for a file from another computer . The term is a reference to Maxwell 's Demon , not religion .

Jerry Fodor -LRB- born 1935 -RRB- is a philosopher . He mostly works on the philosophy of mind and cognitive science , both of which are concerned with how the mind works .
His studies have concerned themselves with the idea of whether thought is expressed in language or whether it is absurd to think so . Fodor also attempted to tie in the design of the brain to the thoughts held within - this is described by many as a return to the 19th century practice of phrenology , although Fodor offers more science to back his version up than phrenologists . It is these views which led other philosophers , such as Jared Cole and Daniel Dennett to describe Fodor 's claims as absurd and out of date - Fodor famously clashed with Dennett when Dennett claimed Fodor had `` bats in his attic '' .
Fodor currently lives in New York City with his wife , Janet . He has two children and several cats . Outside philosophy he enjoys opera and writes for the London Review of Books .

Indo-Canadians are Canadians whose family can trace back to India . The names `` East Indian '' and `` South Asian '' are used on people who originate from India , from the First Nations peoples of Canada who are often called to Indian , and from the people of the Caribbean , who are sometimes called West Indian . Most Indo-Canadians call themselves as , `` Indian '' , instead than `` East Indian '' . This is because Christopher Columbus thought the Americas were India , and that Native Americans were Indian .
Most Indo-Canadians come from India , but some come from the Caribbean , South America , Africa , and the Middle East , an usually live in cities like Toronto , Montreal , Ottawa , Calgary , and Vancouver . They are one of the fastest growing races in Canada , because of immigration .
A city is a place where many people live together . A city has many buildings and streets . It has houses or apartments for many people to live , shops where they may buy things , places for people to work and a government organization to run the city , and to keep law and order in the city . Many people live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do the things they want there . A city usually has a `` city center '' where government and business take place , and places called suburbs where people live around the outside of the center .
There is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called `` city '' and other places are called `` town '' .
In American English , people often call all places cities . -LRB- See below : Size of cities -RRB-
The sizes of cities can be very different . This depends on the type of city that it is . Cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much , are very much smaller than modern cities . There are two main reasons . One reason is that old cities often have a city wall , and most of the city is inside it . Another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow . If the city got too big , it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the market place . People in cities need food , and the food always has to come from outside the city . Cities that were on a river like London could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like Siena in Italy , because the river made a transport route for carrying food and other goods , as well as for transporting people . London has been changing continually for hundreds of years , while Siena , which was a very important city in the 1300s has changed very little in 700 years . Modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large , because the streets are wide enough for cars , buses and trucks , and there are often railway lines as well .
In the US , the word city is often used for towns that are not very big . When the first European people went to America , they gave the name `` city '' to new places . They hoped the places would be great cities in the future . For example , Salt Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people . When they started building the town they made street plans and called it Great Salt Lake City -LRB- for the nearby Great Salt Lake -RRB- . Now , 150 years later , it really is a big city .
In modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger . The whole area is often called a `` metropolis '' and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages . The metropolis of London includes the City of London , the City of Westminster and many old villages such as Notting Hill , Southwark , Richmond , Greenwich and etc. . The part that is officially known as the `` City of London '' only takes up one square mile . The rest is known as `` Greater London '' . Many other cities have grown in the same way .
These giant cities can be exciting places to live , and many people can find good jobs there , but modern cities also have many problems . Many people can not find jobs in the cities and have to get money by begging or by crime . Cars , factories , and garbage create a lot of pollution that makes people sick .
Urban History is history of civilization . The first cities were made in ancient times , as soon as people began to create civilization . Famous ancient cities which fell to ruins included Babylon , Troy , Mycenae and Mohenjo Daro .
Benares in northern India is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more 3000 years . Other cities that have existed since ancient times are Athens in Greece , Rome and Volterra in Italy , Alexandria in Egypt and York in England .
In Europe , in the Middle Ages , being a city was a special privilege , granted by nobility . Cities that fall into this category , usually had -LRB- or still have -RRB- city walls . The people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not . Medieval cities that still have walls include Carcassonne in France , Tehran in Iran , Toledo in Spain and Canterbury in England .
In the United Kingdom , a city is a town which people have always called a city , or which has got the name `` city '' status by royal charter -LRB- a special paper from the king or queen -RRB- . Cities usually get this because they have a special number of people or are important . In the past , cities got that name if they had a cathedral or a university . Some cathedral cities , for example St David 's , are small , and people do not normally think of them as cities . Cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges . The university cities of Oxford and Cambridge are famous throughout the world .
In modern Europe , any town with at least 10,000 people in it can call itself city . Many cities that have their status from the Middle Ages are actually smaller than 10,000 people .
Middlesex is one of the historic counties of England and the second smallest by area . The county once contained the wealthy and politically independent City of London on its southern boundary . The county was affected by the expansion of London in the 18th and 19th centuries . From 1855 the south east was administered as part of London . When county councils were initially introduced in England in 1889 around 20 % of the area of Middlesex , and a third of its population , was transferred to the County of London .
In the interwar years urban London further expanded , with the expansion of public transport , and the setting up of new industries outside inner London .
After a Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London , Middlesex was absorbed by an enlarged Greater London in 1965 . Despite its disappearance as an administrative county , Middlesex is still used as an area name . It was kept as a postal county ; it is an optional component of postal addresses . It is still regarded by many as a meaningful area , with its own teams in County cricket , rugby and other sports and pastimes .

Inception is a 2010 American science fiction action film written , produced , and directed by Christopher Nolan . The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio , Ken Watanabe , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Marion Cotillard , Ellen Page , Tom Hardy , Cillian Murphy , Tom Berenger , and Michael Caine . DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb , a thief who collects information from the subconscious mind of his victims while they dream . Cobb has two children but can not visit them . He is offered a chance to go back to his children in exchange for one last job : performing inception , which is planting a new idea , into the mind of his client 's main business competitor .
The idea behind Inception was first developed over nine years before it was released . In 2001 , Nolan wrote an 80-page treatment about dream-stealers , presenting the idea to Warner Bros. . At first the story was written as a heist film , based on ideas of lucid dreaming and dream incubation . Because Nolan wanted to have more experience working with big-scale films , he chose to work on Batman Begins , The Prestige and The Dark Knight . He spent six months polishing up the script for Inception before Warner Bros. purchased it in February 2009 . Filming spanned six countries and four continents , beginning in Tokyo on June 19 , 2009 and finishing in Canada in late November of the same year . Composer Hans Zimmer wrote the music for the film .
Inception was officially budgeted at $ 160 million , a cost which was shared between Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures . Nolan 's success with The Dark Knight helped gain the film $ 100 million to spend on advertising . Inception was first screened in London on July 8 , 2010 and was shown in standard and IMAX theaters on July 14 , 2010 . The film had a lot of positive reviews and earned over $ 21 million on its opening day , and $ 62.7 million in the first weekend .

The East China Sea is a marginal sea east of China . It is a part of the Pacific Ocean and covers an area of 1,249,000 kmÂ . In China , the sea is called the East Sea . In Korea , the sea is sometimes called `` South Sea '' , but this is more often used to speak only of the area near South Korea 's southern coast .
The East China Sea is bounded on the East by the KyÅ `` shÅ `` and RyÅ `` kyÅ `` islands , on the South by Taiwan , and on the West by mainland China . It is connected with the South China Sea by the Taiwan Strait and with the Sea of Japan by the Korea Strait ; it opens in the North to the Yellow Sea .

Tin is a chemical element . It is chemical element 50 on the periodic table -LRB- the number tells us where the element is found on the table -RRB- . The chemical symbol for tin is Sn . It is in Group 14 on the periodic table . It is not radioactive .
Tin is a silver , somewhat soft metal . It is a post-transition metal . Its melting point is 231.93 Â C and its boiling point is 2602 Â C. It can melt easily in a flame . It is malleable . It makes a crackling sound called tin cry when a piece of it is bent . Tin has more non-radioactive isotopes than any other element .
Tin is found in two allotropes : alpha-tin and beta-tin . Alpha-tin is a brittle , dull , powdery , nonmetallic form of tin . It is made when very pure tin is cooled . Beta-tin is the normal shiny , soft , conductive , metallic form . It is made at higher temperatures . The decay of tin by turning from beta-tin to alpha-tin is called tin pest . Alpha-tin is not wanted in many places . When small amounts of other elements like antimony are added , the tin can not change into alpha-tin . When alpha-tin is heated , it changes into beta-tin .
Tin can be hardened by adding antimony or copper , as well as some other elements . These also make it resistant to tin pest . Tin can also be made very shiny . Tin can make an alloy with copper called bronze .
Tin is corrosion resistant to many things . Salt water and fresh water do not affect it . It does dissolve in strong acids to make tin -LRB- II -RRB- salts . It reacts with some strong bases . Tin can act as a catalyst to make other things corrode when both of them are in a water solution that has dissolved oxygen .
Tin forms chemical compounds in two oxidation states : +2 and +4 . +2 compounds are reducing agents . Some of them are colorless while others are colored . +4 compounds are more unreactive and act more covalent .
Tin burns in air to make tin -LRB- IV -RRB- oxide , which is white . Tin -LRB- IV -RRB- oxide dissolves in acids to make other tin -LRB- IV -RRB- compounds . Tin -LRB- IV -RRB- chloride is a colorless fuming liquid when anhydrous and a white solid when hydrated . It easily reacts with water to make tin -LRB- IV -RRB- oxide and an acid again .
Tin reacts with hydrohalic acids to make tin -LRB- II -RRB- halides . For example , tin -LRB- II -RRB- chloride is made when tin dissolves in hydrochloric acid . Tin -LRB- IV -RRB- halides are made when tin reacts with the halogens . Tin -LRB- IV -RRB- chloride is made when tin reacts with chlorine . Tin -LRB- II -RRB- sulfate is different as it does not oxidize to tin -LRB- IV -RRB- sulfate . Tin -LRB- II -RRB- oxide is a blue-black solid that burns in air to make tin -LRB- IV -RRB- oxide .
Tin is not found as a metal in the ground . It is normally in the form of cassiterite . Cassiterite is a mineral containg tin -LRB- IV -RRB- oxide . The cassiterite is normally found downstream of the cassiterite deposit when it is by a stream or river . Tin is also found in some complicated sulfide minerals .
Tin does not have any major job in the human body .
Tin is made by heating cassiterite with carbon in a furnace . China is the biggest maker of tin .
People discovered tin long ago and used it with other metals . When copper and tin are mixed together , bronze is made . Bronze was important in the past , because it was one of the strongest metals available , which meant it was useful in weapons and tools . Bronze changed the world when it was first invented , starting the Bronze Age . People organized themselves more , because making tools from bronze was harder than making them from rock and wood like they did before .
Tin is used in solder . Solder used to contain a mixture of lead and tin . Now the lead is removed because of its toxicity .
Tin is also used to make pewter , which is mainly tin mixed with a small amount of copper and other metals . Babbitt metal also has tin in it . Tin is used to coat several metals , like lead and steel . Tin plated steel containers are used to store foods . The pipes on a pipe organ are made of tin . Tin foil was used before aluminium foil . Tin was one of the first superconductors to be found . Organotin compounds are more common than almost any other organometal compound . They are used in some PVC pipes to stop them from decaying . Organotin compounds are toxic , though .
Tin is not toxic , but tin compounds are very toxic to marine life . They are a little toxic to humans .

The Constitution of Australia is the laws that set up the Australian Commonwealth Government and the way it works . It is made up of several documents . The most important is the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia . The people of Australia voted in referendums from 1898 â `` 1900 to accept the Constitution . The Constitution was then passed as a part of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 -LRB- Imp -RRB- , an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Queen Victoria signed it on 9 July 1900 . The Constitution became law on 1 January 1901 . Even though the Constitution was an Act of the United Kingdom parliament , the Australia Acts took away the power of the United Kingdom parliament to change the Constitution . Now only the Australian people can change it by referendum .
Two other laws support the Australian Constitution . The first is the Statute of Westminster , as passed by the Commonwealth as the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 . The second is the Australia Act 1986 , which was passed by the Parliaments of every Australian state , the United Kingdom , and the Australian Federal Parliament . Together , these Acts had the effect of cutting all constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom . Even though the same person , Queen Elizabeth II , is the monarch of both countries , these are now separate countries .
Under Australia 's common law system , the High Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia have the power to decide what the constitution actually means . .
The history of the Constitution of Australia began with moves towards federation in the 19th century . This led to the Australian colonies joining together to form the Commonwealth of Australian 1901 .
In the mid-19th century , the Australian colonies needed to work together on things that affected them all , especially tariffs between the colonies . This cooperation led to plans to join the colonies together in a single federation . The push to do this was mainly coming from Britain and there was little local support . The smaller colonies thought they would be taken over by the larger ones . Victoria and New South Wales did not agree about the need to protect local industry as opposed to allowing everyone to trade freely . The then-recent American Civil War also weakened the case for federalism . These difficulties led to the failure of several attempts to bring about federation in the 1850s and 1860s .
By the 1880s Australians were worried about the growing presence of the Germans and the French in the Pacific . Along with a growing Australian identity , this created the opportunity to start the first inter-colonial body , the Federal Council of Australasia , in 1885 . This Federal Council could make laws on certain subjects , but did not have a permanent office , an executive , or its own source of income . New South Wales , the largest colony , would not take part .
Henry Parkes , the Premier of New South Wales , pushed for a series of conferences in the 1890s to talk about federalism . The first one was in Melbourne in 1890 , and another , the National Australasian Convention , in Sydney in 1891 . These were attended by colonial leaders . By the 1891 conference , many people wanted a federal system . Most of the discussion was about how this federal system would work . With help from Sir Samuel Griffith , a draft constitution was written . These meetings did not have popular support . The draft constitution also left out important , but difficult , issues , such as tariff policy . The draft of 1891 was given to colonial parliaments but was not supported by New South Wales . Without NSW , the other colonies were unwilling to continue .
In 1895 , the six premiers of the Australian colonies agreed to set up a new Convention by popular vote . The Convention met over the course of a year from 1897 to 1898 . The meetings produced a new Constitution that was the same as the 1891 draft , but with added provisions for responsible government . To get popular support , the draft was voted on by the electors of each colony . After one failed attempt , a changed draft was given to the electors of each colony except Western Australia . Five colonies passed the Bill that was then sent to the Westminster Parliament with a letter requesting the Queen to make it into law .
The British government made one change before the Bill was passed . The Chief Justices of the colonies wanted the right to appeal decisions of the High Court to the Privy Council on constitutional matters . They were worried that the limits of the powers of the Commonwealth or States could be changed by parliament . The British Parliament passed the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act in 1900 . Western Australia finally agreed to join the Commonwealth in time for it to join the Commonwealth of Australia , which officially began on 1 January 1901 .
In 1990 , the Public Records Office in London loaned the original copy 1900 of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act to Australia . The Australian government wanted to keep the copy . The British parliament agreed by passing the Australian Constitution -LRB- Public Record Copy -RRB- Act 1990 .
Although Federation made Australia independent of Britain , legally the Commonwealth was a creation of the British Imperial Parliament , through the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 -LRB- Imp -RRB- , which applied to Australia . As a result , there was continued uncertainty as to whether British Imperial laws still applied to the Commonwealth . This was fixed by the Statute of Westminster 1931 , adopted by the Commonwealth via the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 . The Statute of Westminster freed the Dominions , including the Commonwealth , from Imperial laws and controls . Legally , this is the moment of Australia 's national independence .
However , British laws were still more important in Australian states . This was fixed by the Australia Act 1986 , which was passed by the parliaments of Australia , the United Kingdom , and each of the states . This law stopped the British Parliament 's power to make laws over Australian states . It also stopped appeals from the Australian courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council . As this was a very important document , Queen Elizabeth II traveled to Australia to sign the proclamation of the law .
One result of these two laws is that Australia is now a fully independent country . The Constitution is now different from the original Act , as the Australian people can change the Constitution , by referendum . However , the original Act remains on the UK 's law book with a note saying , `` The Constitution is not necessarily in the form in which it is in force in Australia '' . Even if the United Kingdom Parliament were to remove the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 , it would have no effect on Australia .
The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 -LRB- Imp -RRB- contains a Preamble , and nine sections . Sections 1 - 8 are explain the laws to set up the Commonwealth . Section 9 , starting with the words `` The Constitution of the Commonwealth shall be as follows ... '' , contains the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia . The Constitution itself is in eight chapters , with 128 sections .
Chapter I sets up the Parliament of Australia . This has three parts :
Section 1 says that legislative power belongs to the Parliament . It is the most powerful part of government .
Part II of Chapter 1 is about the Senate . Senators are to be `` directly chosen by the people of the State '' , voting as a single electorate . Each State is to have the same number of senators . Currently , there are 12 senators for each State , and 2 each for the mainland territories , the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory .
Part III of Chapter 1 is about the House of Representatives . Section 24 says the House must have twice as many members as the Senate , each elected by a single electorate . This is called the ` Nexus ' . It designed to prevent swamping of the senate 's power in the case of a joint sitting -LRB- see Section 57 below -RRB- . The number of electorates in a State is to be based on its share of the national population .
Part IV of Chapter 1 says who can vote , who can be elected to the parliament , how much members can be paid , parliamentary rules and related matters .
Part V of Chapter 1 is about the powers of the parliament . Section 51 deals with powers of the Commonwealth parliament and are called `` specific powers '' . There are `` concurrent powers '' , as both the Commonwealth and States can make laws on these subjects . Federal law is more important if the laws are different -LRB- Section 109 -RRB- . Of the thirty-nine parts of section 51 , a few have become very important in deciding how much power the Commonwealth government has in law . These include the Trade and Commerce Power , the Corporations Power and the External Affairs Power . Section 52 deals with powers that belong only to the Commonwealth parliament . States can not make laws on these subjects .
Chapter II sets up the executive branch of government . Executive power is to be exercised by the Governor-General , advised by the Federal Executive Council . The Governor-General is the commander in chief . He or she may appoint and dismiss the members of the Executive Council , ministers of state , and all officers of the executive government . These powers , along with the powers to dissolve -LRB- or refuse to dissolve -RRB- parliament -LRB- Section 5 , Section 57 -RRB- , are termed `` reserve powers '' . The use of these powers is by convention . Generally , the Governor-General acts only on the advice of the Prime Minister . There has been only one instance of the Governor-General not taking the Prime Minister 's advice . Governor-General Sir John Kerr , acting on his own , dismissed Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis .
Reserve powers in all Westminster nations are only extremely rarely exercised outside of the understood conventions . However , in contrast with the constitutions of other Commonwealth Realms such as Canada which formally grant extensive reserve powers to the Monarch , even the formal powers of the Queen of Australia are extremely limited , and most powers can only be used by the Governor-General .
Section 68 says that the Command in chief of Australia 's naval and military forces as being : `` The command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor General as the Queen 's representative '' . The Commander in chief of the Australian Defense Force is now Her Excellency Quentin Bryce as the Governor General of Australia . The Queen of Australia is not in command of the military .
Chapter III sets up the judicial branch of government . Section 71 gives judicial power in a `` Federal Supreme Court '' to be called the High Court of Australia . The Parliament can also make new federal courts or give other courts federal powers . Such courts are called `` Chapter III Courts '' are the only courts that can use federal judicial power . Sections 73 and 75-78 outline the original and appellate jurisdiction of the High Court . Section 74 explains how an appeal can be made to the Queen in Council . Section 79 allows Parliament to limit the number of judges able to exercise federal jurisdiction and section 80 guarantees trial by jury for indictable offences against the Commonwealth .
Chapter IV deals with finance and trade in the federal system . Section 81 says that all Commonwealth revenue shall form the Consolidated Revenue Fund . Parliament can make laws as to the how its money is spent -LRB- Section 53 -RRB- . Unlike most other powers of the parliament , laws made under this power can not usually be challenged . Section 90 gives the Commonwealth exclusive power over duties of custom and excise .
Section 92 provides that `` trade , commerce , and intercourse among the States shall be absolutely free '' . The precise meaning of this phrase is the subject of a considerable body of law .
Section 96 gives the Commonwealth power to give money to States `` on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit '' . This power is not limited by any other part of the Constitution , such as Section 99 that forbids giving preference to one State or over another State . It is subject only to Section 116 , freedom of religion , and possibly other such freedoms . This power , which was only meant to be used -LRB- `` during a period of ten years ... and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides '' -RRB- , has been used by the Commonwealth to encourage cooperation by the States to various extents over the years .
Section 101 sets up an Inter-State Commission , a body which is no longer exists , but which was meant to have a significant role in the federal structure .
Chapter V sets out how what the States can do in a federal system . Sections 106-108 preserves the Constitution , powers of the Parliament , and the laws in force of each of the States .
Section 109 says that , where a State law is different to a federal law , the federal law is the legal law .
Section 111 says that a State can give up any part of its lands to the Commonwealth . This has happened several times . South Australia gave the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth .
Section 114 stops any state from having its own military force . It also stops the State or the Commonwealth from taxing each other 's property .
Section 116 sets out `` freedom of religion '' , by stopping the Commonwealth from making any law to start a religion , imposing any religious observance , or stop a religion , or religious discrimination for public office .
Chapter VI allows new states to be made , or to join the Commonwealth . Section 122 allows the Parliament to provide for the representation in Parliament of any new territory . Section 123 says that changing the boundaries of a State needs the support of the Parliament of that State and must pass a referendum in that State .
No new states have joined the Commonwealth since federation .
Chapter VII says that the seat of government of the Commonwealth -LRB- now Canberra -RRB- shall be in New South Wales but no less than one hundred miles from Sydney , and that the Governor-General may appoint deputies . Section 127 first said that Aborigines can not be counted in any Commonwealth or State census . This section was changed in 1967 .
Chapter VIII sets out how the Constitution can be changed . Section 128 says that changes must be approved by a referendum . A successful change needs :
The Governor-General must put the referendum bill to the people between two and six months after passing parliament . After the constitutional amendment bill has passed both the parliament and the referendum , it then receives Royal Assent from the Governor-General . This makes it the new law and the wording of the Constitution will be changed .
An exception to this process is if the amendment bill is rejected by one house of Federal Parliament . If the bill passes the first house and is rejected by the second , then after three months the first house may pass it again . If the bill is still rejected by the second house , then the Governor-General may choose to still put the bill to the people 's vote .
As mentioned above , changing the Constitution requires a referendum in which the `` Yes '' vote achieves a majority nationally , as well as majorities in a majority of states .
Forty-four proposals to change the Constitution have been voted on at referendums . Eight have been approved . The following is a list of changes that have been approved .
As well as the written Constitution , and Letters Patent issued by the Crown , conventions are an important part of the Constitution . These have developed over the years and define how various constitutional mechanisms work in practice .
Conventions play a powerful role in the operation of the Australian constitution because of its set-up and operation as a Westminster system of responsible government . Some important conventions include :
However , because conventions are not written down , their existence and practice are open to debate . Real or alleged violation of convention has often led to political controversy . One extreme case was the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 , in which the operation of conventions was seriously tested . The ensuing constitutional crisis was resolved dramatically when the Governor-General Sir John Kerr dismissed the Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam , appointing Malcolm Fraser as caretaker Prime Minister pending the 1975 general election . A number of conventions were said to be broken during this episode . These include :
Note : The convention was written into the Constitution after the national referendum of 1977 . The change means a new Senator has to be from the same party as the old one . This would have prevented the appointment by Lewis , but not that by Bjelke-Petersen . However , the change also says that if the new Senator `` before taking his seat he ceases to be a member of that party ... he shall be deemed not to have been so chosen or appointed '' . Bjelke-Petersen appointee Albert Patrick Field was expelled from the Labor Party before taking his seat and would not have been appointed under the new constitutional change .
In line with the common law tradition in Australia , the law on the interpretation and application of the Constitution has developed largely through judgments by the High Court of Australia in various cases . In a number of seminal cases , the High Court has developed several doctrines which underlie the interpretation of the Australian Constitution . Some examples include :
The vast majority of constitutional cases before the High Court deal with characterisation : whether new laws are part of the power granted to the Commonwealth government by the Constitution .
The Australian Constitution does not include a Bill of Rights . Some people at the 1898 Constitutional Convention wanted a Bill of Rights like the United States Constitution , but the majority felt that the traditional rights and freedoms of British subjects were enough . These would be protected by the Parliamentary system and independent judiciary which the Constitution would create . As a result , the Australian Constitution has often been criticised for not protecting rights and freedoms .
In 1992 and 1994 , the High Court of Australia found that the Constitution gave an `` implied '' right to freedom of political communication , in a series of cases including the Australian Capital Television case and the Theophanous case . This was seen as a necessary part of the democratic system created by the Constitution . The application of this `` implied right '' has , however , been restricted in later cases , such as Lange v ABC . It is in no way equivalent to a freedom of speech , and only protects individuals against the government trying to limit their political communication : it offers no protection against other individuals .
In 2007 , the High Court of Australia in Roach v Electoral Commissioner said that sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution , by providing that members of the House of Representatives and the Senate be `` directly chosen by the people '' , created a limited right to vote . This means that there is a universal franchise in principle , and limited the Federal Parliament 's legislative power to change it . In the case , a legislative change to stop all prisoners from voting -LRB- as opposed to only those serving sentences of three years or more , as it was before the amendment -RRB- was rejected as breaking that right .
Other attempts to find other `` implied rights '' in High Court cases have not been successful .
While a pro forma preamble prefaces the Imperial Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 , the Australian Constitution itself does not have a preamble . There have been some calls to add one to express the spirit and aspirations embodied in the constitution . However , there has been fierce opposition , usually on the basis of the content of the preamble , as well as possible legal ramifications of this text . In 1999 , a proposed preamble , written by John Howard , the then Prime Minister , was defeated in a referendum held concurrently with the Republic referendum . The `` Yes '' vote -LRB- in favor of the insertion of the preamble -RRB- did not achieve a majority in any of the six states .
There have been many people who have wanted Australia to become a republic . On 6 November 1999 , Australians did not support a law to remove the Queen and replace the Governor-General with a President . The President was to be appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament . Opinion poll results said that the majority of Australians are in favor of some form of a republic . Many voters who voted against the 1999 referendum wanted to be able to vote for a President . In research and polling following the 1999 referendum , people said that an appointed President would not be able to act independently of the Parliament . By being able to appoint the President , rather than having the people elect a President , many felt that too much power was being given to Parliament with no check or balance on that power . Support for holding another referendum in the near future seems to be growing , and another referendum may be held . Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the current situation `` no longer reflects either the fundamental democratic principles that underpin the Australian nation or its diversity '' , . He was thinking about a referendum for an independent , elected President . He went on to say that `` over the next year there would be an `` accelerated public debate '' about the monarchy question '' .
Constitution Day is celebrated on 9 July , the date the Constitution became law in 1900 . The date is not a public holiday . Constitution Day was first held on 9 July 2000 to mark the centenary of the Constitution as part of the Centenary of Federation . The celebrations were not big and have not been widely held after 2001 . Constitution Day was revived in 2007 and is jointly organised by the National Archives of Australia , which holds the original Constitution documents , and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship .
Binge eating is an eating disorder where people suddently feel the urge to eat . This urge usually can not be controlled . People who suffer form this have a high risk of weight gain . People who binge and then purge -LRB- usually by vomiting -RRB- are bulimic .
Fedora is a distribution -LRB- or distro -RRB- of Linux developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat . It is designed to be safe and is used by companies and governments . Fedora 's mission statement is : `` Fedora is about the rapid progress of Free and Open Source software . ''
Linus Torvalds , author of the Linux kernel , says he uses Fedora because it had fairly good support for PowerPC when he used that processor architecture . He became used to the operating system and continues to use it .
Fedora Core 1 was the first version of Fedora and was released on November 6 , 2003 , and was codenamed Yarrow .

A chemical element is a substance that contains only one type of atom . If a substance contains more than one type of atom , it is a compound . An element can be a solid , liquid or gas . The smallest particle of such an element is an atom . Atoms are made up of protons , neutrons , and electrons .
Element contains only one kind of atom . The number of protons in the atoms of an element is known as that element 's atomic number . For example , all atoms with 6 protons in their nuclei are of the chemical element carbon , and all atoms with 92 protons in their nuclei are of the element uranium .
118 different chemical elements are known to modern chemistry . 92 of these elements can be found in nature and the human body is made up of 26 elements . The others can only be made in laboratories . The last natural element discovered was uranium , in 1789 . The first man-made element was Technetium , in 1937 . All man-made elements are radioactive and unstable .
Chemical elements are commonly arranged in the periodic table . Where the elemnts are in the table tells us about their properties relative to the other elements .
Chemical elements are also given a unique chemical symbol . Chemical symbols are used all over the world . This means that , no matter which language is spoken , there is no confusion about what the symbol means . Chemical symbols of elements come from their English or Latin names . For example , carbon has the chemical symbol ` C ' , and sodium has chemical symbol ` Na ' , after the Latin natrium . Tungsten is called ` W ' after its German name , wolfram . ` Au ' is the symbol for gold and it comes from the Latin word for gold , aurum . Another symbol which comes from Latin is ` Ag ' . This is the element silver and it comes from the Latin argentum . Lead 's symbol , ` Pb ' , comes from the Latin plumbum and the English word plumber derives from this as pipes used to be made out of lead . Others were named after famous people , like einsteinium was named after Albert Einstein .
Elements can join -LRB- react -RRB- to form pure compounds -LRB- such as water , salts , oxides , and organic compounds -RRB- . In many cases , these compounds have a fixed composition and their own structure and properties . The properties of the compound may be very different from the elements it is made from . Sodium is a metal that burns when put into water and chlorine is a poisonous gas . When they react together they make sodium chloride -LRB- salt -RRB- which is harmless and edible .
Some elements , particularly metal elements mix together in any proportion to form new structures . Such new structures are not compounds . They are called mixtures .
Atoms of the same element , whose nuclei contain a different number of neutrons , are said to be different isotopes of the element .
Elements can be classified based on physical states . At room temperature and pressure , most elements are solids , only 11 are gases and 2 are liquids .
Elements can also be classified into metals and non-metals . There are many more metals than non-metals .
However , a few elements have properties in between those of metals and non-metals . These elements are called semimetals -LRB- or metalloids -RRB- .
A dirge is a sad song or poem of unhappiness . They are usually sung at funerals . For example , a dirge was sung for the soldiers that had died in the Battle of Gettysburg before Abraham Lincoln delivered his Gettysburg Address . The word dirge came from the Latin word dirige , which means `` direct '' . It is likely that dirge also came from the old expression Dirige , Domine , Deus meus , in conspectu tuo viam meam -LRB- `` Direct my way in your sight , O Lord my God '' -RRB- . `` Dirge '' , meaning to direct , is the same as a `` dirigible '' -LRB- `` steerable '' -RRB- airship . These two words became connected in 1937 because of the Hindenburg disaster .

Howie Morenz was a big star in the early years of the NHL . He was a great skater . Morenz won the Hart Trophy , as the league 's top player , three times . Goalie George Hainsworth played at the same time , and along with others such as Aurel Joliat , they won the Stanley Cup in 1930 and 1931 .
It took 13 years before they won the Cup again . A young Maurice `` The Rocket '' Richard , star goalie Bill Durnan , Hector `` Toe '' Blake , and Elmer Lach led the Canadiens to the cup again in 1944 , as well as 1946 . Richard scored 50 goals in a 50-game season in 1944-45 . No one did that again for 36 years . He led the NHL in goals five times .

Driftwood is wood that has been washed onto the shore of a sea , river , or lake by winds , tides , waves or man .
In some waterfront areas , driftwood is a major nuisance . However , the driftwood provides shelter and food for birds , fish and other aquatic species as it floats in the ocean . Gribbles , shipworms and bacteria decompose the wood and gradually turn it into nutrients that are reintroduced to the food web . Sometimes , the partially decomposed wood washes ashore , where it also shelters birds , plants , and other species . Driftwood can become the foundation for sand dunes .
According to Norse mythology , the first humans , Ask and Embla , were formed out of two pieces of driftwood , an ash and an elm , by the god Odin and his brothers , Ve and Vili .
Driftwood carried by Arctic rivers was the main , or sometimes only , source of wood for some Inuit and other Arctic populations living north of the tree-line until they came into regular contact with European traders .
Many people use driftwood as parts of decorative furniture or other art forms , and it is a popular element in the scenery of fish tanks .

The Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways -LRB- often called the Interstate Highway System , Interstate or I - -RRB- , is a group of roads in the United States . They are grade separated , which means drivers must use a specially made group of ramps , called an interchange or exit , in order to get on or off the Interstate . Because of this , people are allowed to go very fast , sometimes up to 80 miles per hour -LRB- 130 km\/hr -RRB- .
The standards setting body which publishes specifications , quality control protocols and guidelines for the highway design and construction throughout the United States is AASHTO .
Interstates have a special way to figure out their numbers . The main Interstates have numbers with 1 or 2 digits . Interstates that run east\/west are even numbers -LRB- 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , or 0 -RRB- , and north\/south Interstates are odd numbers -LRB- 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , or 9 -RRB- . For east\/west Interstates , the small numbers are in the south and the big numbers are in the north . For north\/south Interstates , the small numbers are in the west and the big numbers are in the east . The important east\/west Interstates have numbers ending in `` 0 '' and the important north\/south Interstates have numbers ending in `` 5 '' .
Some cities have short freeways that get a three-digit number . That means that there is an extra number put ahead of the number of the Interstate . This number is even -LRB- 2 , 4 , 6 , or 8 -RRB- if the Interstate goes around a city and connects with another Interstate , and odd -LRB- 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , or 9 -RRB- if an Interstate goes into a city and ends at a road that is not an Interstate Highway . Numbers can be used again in different states . Three-digit Interstates usually go to the Interstate in their last two numbers . For example , Interstate 195 goes to Interstate 95 .

In 1888 , Roux published the results of a series of defect experiments in which he took 2 and 4 cell frog embryos and killed half of the cells of each embryo with a hot needle . He reported that they grew into half-embryos and surmised that the separate function of the two cells had already been determined . This led him to propose his `` mosaic '' theory : after a few cell divisions the embryo would be like a mosaic , each cell playing its own unique part in the entire design .
After a few years Roux 's theory was refuted by the studies of his colleague Hans Driesch and later , with more precision , Hans Spemann showed that , as a rule , Driesch 's conclusions were correct , but that results like Roux 's may be obtained after intervention in certain planes . Despite this early lapse Roux 's pioneering mechanical methodology was to prove most fruitful in 20th century biology .
In a remarkable paper , Roux realized the significance of the linear structure of chromosomes . Their splitting into two equal longitudinal halves assured each daughter cell got the same chromosome complement . Therefore , chromosomes were the bearers of heredity . This was a significant event in cytogenetics .

Mesons are incredibly small subatomic particles that are made of one quark and one antiquark . Antiquarks are the antimatter counterpart of a regular quark , meaning that in a fraction of a second , the two quarks will annihilate each other . Since antimatter quarks have the opposite spin of regular quarks , their spins can cancel each other out , which forms a particle similar to a Higgs Boson . The name meson comes from Greek `` mesos '' , meaning middle . This refers to the fact that their predicted mass was between the known masses of a proton and a neutron .
Mesons are Hadrons , which simply means that they are made of quarks . Since quarks have different fractional charges , Mesons can have a charge . However , the charges of the quarks may cancel out , forming an uncharged Meson . The rest of the Hadron family are known as baryons , which are made of three quarks . Since quarks all have a spin of 1\/2 , three of them will never add up to an integer spin . An integer spin is simply 0 , 1 , or 2 . Particles with an integer spin are called bosons , which obey Bose-Einstein Statistics . This means that more than one boson can actually be in the same point in space at the same time . However , a Meson is made of one quark and one antiquark , which each do not have an integer spin . Particles which do not have an integer spin have a spin of 1\/2 or 3\/2 . These particles with 1\/2 spin are called Fermions because they obey Fermi-Dirac Statistics . This means that no more than one fermion can be in the same point in space at the same time . All known baryons and quarks -LRB- and antiquarks -RRB- are fermions , and all mesons are bosons . This can get very confusing because this means that more than one meson can exist in the same point in space at the same time , but the quarks that make up mesons can not exist in the same point in space at the same time .
The most common natural way that we find Mesons are through the interactions of cosmic rays with matter . This process can be duplicated in particle accelerators , which smash high-energy quarks and antiquarks . However , the Mesons are very unstable and quickly turn into other particles . Charged Mesons can decay into electrons and neutrinos , and uncharged Mesons can decay into photons . Since antimatter is destroying matter , a large amount of energy is created . The energy follows the equation E = mc2 .

Proportional representation is a system used to elect a country 's government . If proportional representation is used in an election , a political party that wins 10 % of the vote , will win 10 % of the seats in parliament and a party that wins 20 % of the vote , will win 20 % of the seats .
If a party wins over 50 % of the vote , it wins over 50 % of the seats and can form a government , however this does not happen very often because most countries have lots of different political parties . If no party wins over 50 % of the vote , then a coalition government usually has to be formed , where a government is formed from two or more different political parties , who together have over 50 % of the seats in parliament .
Countries which use proportional representation include : Austria , Argentina , Belgium , Brazil , Bulgaria , Czech Republic , Denmark , Estonia , Finland , Greece , Iceland , Israel , Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Romania , Russia , South Africa , South Korea , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland and Turkey .
Countries which have systems that are similar or partly use proportional representation include : Australia , Germany , Hungary , India , Republic of Ireland , Italy , Japan , Mexico , New Zealand , Scotland , Thailand and Wales .

Cell biology is the study of how living cells work . This includes the structure and function of the cell organelles , and the carbon-based molecules which cells produce . The most important molecules are DNA , RNA and proteins .
The most important structures in the cell are the nucleus and the chromosomes , but there are many others . The structure of eukaryotic cells is much more complex than prokaryotic cells . This is because endosymbiosis has occurred : some or all of the eukaryote organelles are former prokaryotes . Examples are mitochondria and plastids .
The most important function of cells is to divide by mitosis or meiosis . Cells in a multicellular organism also specialise in different functions , and the different types may look quite to each other .

The part of the name `` syriacus '' seems to say that the origin of this plant is Syria , but the exact origin is so far unknown . Historically it was grown in ancient China and then it became a popular plant in Korea . Today the flowers are national symbols of Korea . And in Japan , the flowers are often shown at tea ceremonies for decoration .
There are many variations of flowers in Europe and in Asia ; especially in Japan , because gardeners of the past were willing to produce different colors and shapes of flowers .
Lulu is an opera by the composer Alban Berg . Berg took the story from two plays called Erdgeist and Die BÃ 1\/4 chse des Pandora by the German playwright Frank Wedekind . Berg wrote the libretto -LRB- the words for the opera -RRB- himself .
Many people found Lulu very shocking because the story is very decadent . There is a lot of blood , murder , sex and violence in it . Also : Bergâ s music was quite difficult to understand . He uses twelve tone music , which is not in any particular key , although he uses it to make a style of music which is often very Romantic and expressive . Berg started to write the opera in 1929 , but then he stopped working on it to write his Violin Concerto . When Berg died , he had not finished the last act of the opera , he had only sketched it . Schoenberg was asked whether he would finish the opera , but he thought it would be too much work . When the opera was first performed in 1937 there were only two acts : the opera was unfinished . Bergâ s widow , Helene , said that nobody was allowed to finish it and that it should stay unfinished . For more than 40 years that is how the opera was performed .
When Helene died in 1976 a man called Friedrich Cerha finished the opera , guessing what Berg might have written . This completed version was performed in 1979 at the Opera Garnier , conducted by Pierre Boulez .
Famous sopranos who have sung the main part of Lulu include Teresa Stratas , Anja Silja and Christine SchÃ fer .
Prologue : A circus ringmaster introduces all his animals . The last one is Lulu herself , who is carried on stage and introduced as a snake .
Scene 1 : Lulu , the wife of Dr. Goll , an old doctor , is having her portrait painted . Dr. SchÃ n , a newspaper editor who rescued Lulu when she was living in the streets , is now having a love affair with her . Dr. SchÃ nâ s son Alwa arrives , excuses himself , and he and Dr. SchÃ n leave . The Painter wants to make love to Lulu . Dr. Goll unexpectly walks in , sees that the two of them are alone , collapses and dies of a heart attack .
Scene 2 : Lulu has now married the Painter . She gets a telegram which says that Dr. SchÃ n is engaged to be married . Schigolch , a tramp , visits her . He seems to have had something to do with her in the past . Dr. SchÃ n arrives . He talks as if Schigolch is Lulu 's father . He has come to ask Lulu to stay out of his life from now on . She takes no notice and leaves after her husband , the Painter , arrives . Dr. SchÃ n tells the Painter about their affair , and says he must talk to his wife about it . The Painter leaves , but instead of going to talk to Lulu he cuts his own throat and dies . Lulu does not seem to care and simply tells Dr. SchÃ n `` You 'll marry me all the same . ''
Scene 3 : Lulu , working as a dancer , is sitting in her dressing room with Alwa . They talk about a Prince who is in love with Lulu and who wants to marry her . Lulu leaves to go on stage , but refuses to go on because Dr. SchÃ n and his fiancÃ e are in the audience . Dr. SchÃ n , comes in to try to persuade her to perform . When the two are left alone , she tells SchÃ n that she is thinking of leaving with the Prince to go to Africa . Dr. SchÃ n realizes that he can not live without her , and Lulu makes him write a letter to his fiancÃ e saying that he does not want to marry her . Lulu carries on with the show .
Scene 1 : Lulu has now married Dr. SchÃ n , who is full of jealousy because so many men seem to love Lulu . One of them , the lesbian Countess Geschwitz , visits her to invite her to a ball , but leaves when Dr. SchÃ n disapproves . When the two go out , the Countess returns and hides . Two other admirers , the Acrobat and the Schoolboy , also enter , and all begin to talk to Lulu when she returns . Alwa arrives , and the admirers hide as Alwa tells Lulu he loves her . Dr. SchÃ n returns , sees the Acrobat , and begins a long argument with Lulu . Gradually he finds the other people who are hiding . He gives Lulu a revolver , and tells her to kill herself , but she shoots SchÃ n instead . The police arrive to arrest Lulu for the murder .
Interlude : during the music of the interlude a silent movie is shown . In it , we see Lulu being taken by the police , tried in court , and put into prison . Then we see her deliberately getting the illness cholera and being taken to hospital . The Countess Geschwitz visits her , and gives her her own clothes , so that Lulu can escape disguised as the Countess .
Scene 2 : The Countess Geschwitz , Alwa and the Acrobat are in the same room as Act II , Scene 1 . They are waiting for Schigolch , who is to take the Countess to the hospital . She is going to give up her own freedom by taking Lulu 's place so that nobody will discover she has escaped until it is too late . The Acrobat says he is going to marry Lulu and move with her to Paris where the two will work in an act together . Schigolch leaves with the countess , then returns with Lulu , who is so ill from her disease that the Acrobat does not follow his plan , but goes off to get the police instead . Schigolch is sent off to buy train tickets , and , left alone , Alwa and Lulu say they love each other and agree to go away together .
Scene 1 : Lulu and Alwa are now living in Paris . The scene is a party in a casino . Lulu is being forced by blackmail to work in a Cairo brothel by the Acrobat and a pimp . The police still want her for Dr. SchÃ n 's murder and the Acrobat and the pimp say to her that they will take her to the police if she does not do as they say . Schigolch arrives , asking for money . She is persuaded to lure the Acrobat away to a hotel and murder him . After they have gone , news arrives that the railway company has run out of money . The guests have all got money in the company . The party quickly breaks up , and in the confusion , Lulu manages to change clothes with a young man . She escapes with Alwa just before the police arrive to catch her .
Scene 2 : Lulu and Alwa are now living with Schigolch . They are poor are in London so that the police can not find them . Lulu is working as a prostitute . She arrives with a client , a professor -LRB- played by the same actor as Dr. Goll , Lulu 's first husband -RRB- . The Countess Geschwitz then arrives with a portrait of Lulu which she has brought from Paris . Alwa hangs it on the wall . Lulu goes out , and returns with another client , the Negro -LRB- played by the same actor as the Painter , Lulu 's second husband -RRB- . He refuses to pay before making love , and kills Alwa in a struggle . Schigolch takes the body away while Geschwitz thinks about killing herself , but then gives up the idea when she realizes that Lulu does not care . Eventually , Lulu goes out and comes back with a third client -LRB- played by the same actor as Dr. SchÃ n , Lulu 's third husband -RRB- . He argues over the price , and is about to leave when Lulu decides she will sleep with him for less than her usual fee . This client , who is actually Jack the Ripper , murders Lulu , and then on his way out kills the Countess as well , who swears her love to Lulu as the curtain comes down .
The shape of the whole opera is often said to be like a mirror - Lulu 's popularity in the first act is mirrored by the poverty she lives in during Act III . Also , Lulu 's husbands in Act I are played by the same singers as her clients in Act III . In the middle of the opera is the movie . Even some of the music is a palindrome -LRB- it reads the same forwards as backwards -RRB- .
Some of the characters have their own music which , in each case , is a theme made of twelve notes . This is the twelve-tone system which was invented by Bergâ s teacher Arnold Schoenberg . By giving each character a theme he is using the idea of a leitmotif which was used a lot by Wagner .

In chemistry , Polytetrafluoroethylene -LRB- often shortened to PTFE -RRB- is a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene . It is a fluoropolymer , because the polymerization is based on strong bonds of fluorine and carbon . Polytetrafluoroethylene is not very reactive . It also repels oil and water . It is better known by its trade-names , Teflon , and Gore-Tex . Teflon is a coating done to frying pans , among others . Gore-Tex is a membrane used in clothing .
To produce Polytetrafluoroethylene , Perfluorooctanoic acid is needed . Perfluorooctanoic acid is problematic because it is very toxic , does not degrade well , and may cause cancer . The precursors for many chemical weapons are highly corrosive , their containers are therefore often treated with Polytetrafluoroethylene . For this reason , the export of Polytetrafluoroethylene from the European Union may need a special permit .

At the Examiner , Bronstein specialized in investigations and was a foreign correspondent for eight years . He has won awards for his writing about the Philippines from the Overseas Press Club , Associated Press , the World Affairs Council and Media Alliance . He was named executive editor of the Examiner in 1991 , having previously served as managing editor for news . Under his service , the Examiner circulation declined rapidly , which Bronstein blamed on the afternoon delivery of the paper .
Bronstein was named executive vice president and editor of the San Francisco Chronicle in March 2003 . He had been senior vice president and executive editor of the paper when Hearst Corp. bought The Chronicle .
The newspaper had been selling fewer newspapers each year . In late March 2007 , Bronstein called an emergency staff meeting and reportedly stated that the news business `` is broken , and no one knows how to fix it . '' This meeting happened after several weeks of articles focused on the influence of the Internet and the blogosphere made front page headlines in the Chronicle .
On January 23 , 2008 , Bronstein announced that he was leaving his job as editor of the Chronicle . He became editor-at-large with Hearst Newspapers .

A skeleton is the hard structure that supports the body of a living thing . Skeletons can be inside the body or outside the body . In mammals , which include humans , the skeleton is made of bones . All the bones , when they are joined together , make the `` skeletal system '' of a body . The skeletal system or `` skeleton '' is under the skin , the muscle and the tissue of the body . The skeleton supports the skin , muscle and tissue , and all the organs that are inside the body . The skeleton protects important internal organs like the brain , heart and lungs .
The important parts of a human body are the head , the spine , the chest , the abdomen , the arms and hands , and the legs and feet .
The head bones all together are called the skull .
The spine supports the head , the chest and the structure that carries the arms . It is made of small bones called vertebrae . The spine , all together , is called the spinal column . It is not straight , but has curves that help to support the body , and help the person to move and bend . One bone is a `` vertebra '' . Lots are `` vertebrae '' . The `` vertebrae '' have different names , depending on the part of the body they are joined to .
This part of the body is made of the sacrum and the two pelvic bones which are joined to it on either side . The pelvic bones are carried by the leg bones , and they support the `` spinal column '' . Each pelvic bone has a strong structure for the leg bone to fit into , so that a person can stand , walk , run and jump . Each pelvic bone spreads into a large flat plate which supports the person 's `` internal organs '' . The pelvis of a woman spreads into a wider shape than a man 's , so that when the woman is pregnant , the baby is supported by the pelvis , until it is ready to be born . At the bottom of the pelvis is a large opening , big enough for a baby to pass through .
The chest is called the thorax , and the vertebrae that are part of it are the thoracic vertebrae . The thorax is made up of long flat curved bones called ribs . At the back , the ribs are joined to the vetebrae . At the front , most of the ribs are joined to the sternum , which is often called the `` breast bone '' . All together , the `` thorax '' protects the heart , lungs and stomach .
At the top of the `` thorax '' is the shoulder girdle . This is made of two thin horizontal bones at the front , joined to the `` sternum '' . These two bones are called the clavicles or `` collar bones '' . At the back of the `` thorax '' are two flat triangular-shaped bones called the scapulae , or `` shoulder blades '' . The `` clavicles '' and `` scapulae '' come together on each side to make `` shoulders '' . The bones of the arms fit into sockets -LRB- cup-like holes -RRB- in the `` scapulae '' .
Arms and legs both have a thicker bone at the top and two thinner bones at the bottom . They both have a rotating joint at the top , and a hinge joint in the middle . The hands and feet have lots of bones and are joined to the arms and legs by small bones with sliding parts .
A skeleton , or just a skull , has often been used as a symbol for Death .
Skeletons , particularly living skeletons , have often been used in horror stories and comedies .

A manor house or fortified manor-house is a country house , which has historically formed the center of a manor -LRB- see Manorialism -RRB- . The term is sometimes used for relatively small country houses which belonged to gentry families , as well as to grand stately homes , particularly as a technical term for minor late medieval castles more intended for show than for defense .
In general terms , the manor house was the house of a feudal lord of a manor , which he occupied only on occasional visits if he held many manors . Although not built with strong fortifications as castles were , many manor houses were partly fortified : they were enclosed within walls or ditches . Often the farm buildings were within these walls as well . Many of manor houses were equipped with small gatehouses and watchtowers .
The main feature of the manor house was its great hall . By the beginning of the 16th century , manor houses as well as small castles began to acquire the character and amenities of the residences of country gentlemen . This late 16th century transformation produced many of the smaller Renaissance chÃ cents teaux of France and the many country mansions of the Elizabethan and Jacobean styles in England .
In France , the terms chÃ cents teau or manoir are often used synonymously to describe a French manor house . Maison-forte is another French word to describe a strongly fortified manor house . In the western France provinces of Brittany and Normandy , certain large manors enjoyed real means of protection .
In modern usage , the term manor or manor house is often used , especially outside Europe , to mean simply either a country house or indeed any other house considered to resemble one , without any reference to age or to the historical sense of the term .

The iPhone is a mobile phone made by Apple Inc. . It does many different things like a computer but is small enough to fit in someone 's hand . It is a mobile phone ; it makes calls without wires . It can access the Internet as well . Like an iPod , it plays music and videos that have been put on it from a big computer , which is called syncing . It also has a calendar and camera , and can send text messages . People use the iPhone by touching the screen with a finger or two . This is done by tapping , dragging , and even typing on a keyboard shown on the screen .
There have been four types of iPhone . At first , only people in the United States who paid Cingular\/AT & T for their mobile phones could buy the iPhone , starting on June 29 , 2007 . In November 2007 , Apple took the iPhone to a few new countries in Europe . On July 11 , 2008 , Apple said that they would sell a better iPhone , called the iPhone 3G . 3G means it talks to the Internet faster . It also has GPS , which lets it know where it is better than the first iPhone could . Apple now sells the iPhone 3G in more than 75 countries . On June 17 , 2009 , Apple released the iPhone 3GS . The iPhone 3GS is faster than the iPhone 3G . It can be controlled by speaking to it . It can also find directions with a compass . On June 24 2010 , the newest version of iPhone -LRB- iPhone 4 -RRB- was released . It has a video chat feature , and has an updated operating system that can make it do many tasks at once -LRB- called multitasking -RRB- . And it has more pixels on the screen , which makes the screen look better .
In most places , the iPhone is only allowed with carriers -LRB- people who make mobile phones work -RRB- that Apple likes . Someone who buys an iPhone also makes a contract with the carrier , which is an agreement to pay for service . A mobile phone contract usually lasts for two years , and the person buying the phone pays the carrier every month . At first , they pay less than the iPhone is worth because they will pay the rest later because of the agreement . The contract also says the iPhone may only be used on their network . However , some people do not like that , so they `` unlock '' their iPhone so it can be used with other carriers . Apple is unhappy by this and will stop the iPhone warranty .
Apple made a Software Development Kit for the iPhone , which lets people make their own software for it . But to sell the software , Apple must give permission . The software is sold at the App Store . Many thousands of apps are available to buy .
Apple sold 5.2 million iPhones in the third fiscal quarter of 2009 .

Babylonia was a city state in Mesopotamia in the second millenium BC , over 3000 years ago . Its capital city was Babylon , which meant The Gate of the Gods . They built an empire out of the lands of the former Akkadian empire .
Mesopotamia is the region of the two rivers , Euphrates and Tigris . At that time the region also included the city states of Assyria to the north , and Elam to the south-east . It is part of the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East . It was there people first lived together in a civilization , with farming , cities and writing .
The Babylonians had a written language that they used for trade and communication . They got it from the Sumerians , who invented it . The Babylonians used the same cuneiform system of pressing triangular shapes into soft clay . They wrote in two different languages : the Sumerian for religious purposes and Akkadian for official purposes .
Hammurabi was a king of Babylon who fought wars and made Babylonia into an empire by putting Assyria under a vassal -LRB- puppet -RRB- king . He created the earliest written set of laws , called the Code of Hammurabi . It has 280 judgments and can be seen today in the Louvre , a museum in Paris . Whereas the earlier Sumerian punishments had not been harsh , Babylonian law was quite severe . The death penalty was given for theft , murder , and other crimes .
The houses in Babylon had open roofs , so that on hot nights , the family could sleep there . The living rooms , dining rooms , and the kitchens were , of course , downstairs . Lamps burned with olive oil , and every house had a chapel for burial and worship ceremonies . Since Mesopotamia had only clay for use in building , the strong wooden supports for the houses were imported from Lebanon . Eventually , people began baking their bricks and improved the strength of their buildings .
Later , Babylon was sacked by the Hittite king Musilis I , which led to the so-called ` Dark Ages ' of the Bronze Age , where there is little evidence in writing . The date of the sacking of Babylon is debated by archaeologists , who have proposed no fewer than four chronologies . Possible dates for the sack of Babylon are :
The difficulty is to line up the Mesopotamian dates with the Ancient Egyptian dates .
After the Hittite destruction , Babylon was ruled by Kassites for 576 years . Next it was ruled by Elam , and then regained its independence for about three centuries . They were then conquered by the Neo-Assyrians . A century later they again became free , to form the Neo-Babylonian or Chaldean Empire . This constant conquest and re-conquest is partly due to geography . There are no natural boundaries except the rivers , and it is easy to get at the cities from north or south .
The king Nebuchadnezzar II , whose reign of 43 years made Babylon once more the mistress of the civilized world , conquered Phoenicia in 585 BC .
The Babylonian empire was finally brought to an end by Cyrus the Great of Persia .
It was in 549 BC that Cyrus put an end to the empire of the Medes . Three years later Cyrus had become king of the Achaemenid Empire -LRB- Persia -RRB- , and was engaged in a campaign in northern Mesopotamia .
In 539 BC Cyrus invaded Babylonia . A battle was fought at Opis in the month of June , where the Babylonians were defeated ; and immediately afterwards Sippara surrendered to the invader . Two days after the capture of Sippara , `` the soldiers of Cyrus entered Babylon without fighting '' . Cyrus did not arrive until the 3rd of Marchesvan -LRB- October -RRB- , Gobryas having acted for him in his absence . Gobryas was now made governor of the province of Babylon .
Cyrus now claimed to be the legitimate successor of the ancient Babylonian kings and the avenger of their god Bel-Marduk . The invasion of Babylonia by Cyrus was doubtless helped by the presence of foreign forced exiles like the Jews , who had been planted in the midst of the country .
One of the first acts of Cyrus was to allow these exiles to return to their own homes , carrying with them the images of their god and their sacred vessels . The permission to do so was embodied in a proclamation , whereby the conqueror endeavored to justify his claim to the Babylonian throne . The feeling was still strong that none had a right to rule over western Asia until he had been consecrated to the office by Bel and his priests ; and accordingly , Cyrus henceforth assumed the imperial title of `` King of Babylon . ''
Like the Sumerians , the Babylonians ate vegetables , fruits , meat , and fish . They also ate bread and enjoyed toasting and eating the pesky but crunchy locusts which destroyed their precious crops .
The Babylonians loved art . Beautiful vessels ornamented with sparkling gold were buried with the kings . In those days books dealt with floods which were thought to be caused by sin , or about the journey of Abraham . Science , too , improved well : they invented the first calendar , the 60-minute hour , and the advance multiplication table .
Life was rich , full , and usually peaceful . People rarely thought about war or how to protect the city . As a result , Babylon was conquered in 730 BC by the Assyrians and Kassites . This great civilization then ended .

Joe Louis -LRB- born Joseph Louis Barrow on May 13 , 1914 , died April 12 , 1981 -RRB- was an American boxer . He was the world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949 . Louis won the title from James Braddock . He made a record twenty-five title defenses before giving up the title in 1949 .
Perhaps his most famous fight was his one-round knockout of Max Schmeling , the German former heavyweight champion , in 1938 . Schmeling had given Louis his only loss up to that point , and was widely seen at that time as a representative of Nazi Germany . The buildup to the fight was wrapped up in the politics of the United States versus Nazi Germany .
When World War II began , Louis signed up for the U.S. Army . While in the army , Joe boxed 100 exhibition bouts .
Louis died on April 12 , 1981 . He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery .
He has an arena named after him the Joe Louis Arena where the Detroit Red Wings play .

A ligand is a biochemical substance . Its function is to bind to an biological molecule , and form a larger chemical complex . The complex then carries out a biological function .
In a narrower sense , it is a signal triggering molecule , binding to a site on a target protein .
The binding occurs by intermolecular forces , such as ionic bonds , hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces . The docking -LRB- association -RRB- is usually reversible -LRB- dissociation -RRB- . Actual irreversible covalent binding between a ligand and its target molecule is rare in biological systems .
Ligand binding alters the shape of the receptor protein . This changes the protein 's behavior . Ligands include substrates , inhibitors , activators , and neurotransmitters . The tendency or strength of binding is called affinity .

Genetic engineering , or GE , is a branch of biology . It focuses on making food , animals and plants better adapted to the need of humans . It does this by tweaking genes . Some people see a problem in this .
Genetic Engineering is when scientists can duplicate and can add on genes to the animal 's chromosomes to make meat more satisfying , but some people see a problem in this . Some people find that Genetic engineering is disturbing because some of the animalâ s bodies may have traces of infectious diseases .
There is a risk that some genetically modified -LRB- GM -RRB- organisms may be better adapted to some niche in nature , and will take away some space of another organism . It could also be that some of the genetic modifications leak into unengineered plants . Many people do not think so , however . They feel the risks do not outweigh the benefits of GE .
Common genetic modifications are that some plants produce pesticides and fungicides themselves , or that they spoil only later on . Genetic engineering is also used to clone animals . The process of genetic engineering is a common topic of debate among scientists and scholars alike .
We can now produce and use GM and GE seeds . Some large countries like India and China have already decided that GM farming is what they need to feed their populations of the future . Other countries are still debating the issue .
This debate involves scientists , farmers , politicians , companies and UN agencies . Even those involved in the production of GM seedlings are not in total agreement .

El Toro -LRB- The Bull -RRB- is a wooden rollercoaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson , New Jersey , United States . It was opened -LRB- people could go on it -RRB- on June 11 , 2006 . It has the steepest drop of any wooden rollercoaster in the world , at 76 degrees . It is 188ft tall , a world record breaking drop on a wooden roller coaster , and goes at a maximum -LRB- highest possible -RRB- speed of 113km\/h . The speed can be different . During the day it goes faster and faster . It begins at 108km\/h and by the end of the day it travels at 118km\/h . It has 4,400 feet of track , and the trains are known to not really slow down much through the whole ride . El Toro is also known for its strong airtime -LRB- when riders would be thrown out of the seats if the restraints were not there -RRB- . El Toro is quite different than most other wooden rollercoasters because it is made out prefabricated track , which means that the pieces of track were cut in a factory and do not need to be cut by hand . This makes the time to build El Toro much shorter . Since it uses prefabricated track , the ride is very smooth . Most wooden rollercoasters are known to be quite rough .
Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound , with the chemical formula CaCO3 . It is a common substance found as rock in all parts of the world , and is the main component of seashells , snails , and eggshell . Calcium carbonate is usually the main cause of hard water . It is used as a calcium supplement or as a treatment for antacid , but too much can be bad for your health .
To test whether a mineral or rock contains calcium carbonate , strong acids , such as hydrochloric acid , can be added to it . If the sample does contain calcium carbonate , it will fizz and produce carbon dioxide and water . Weak acids such as acetic acid will react , but less quickly . All of the rocks\/minerals mentioned above will react with acid .

An icon when talked about in computing is a picture which usually stands for a computer program , computer file , folder , or an action for a program to do . Icons are usually small pictures , but not always . Sometimes the user can change what size an icon is .
Icons are used in many places on a computer . The desktop contains icons as shortcuts - clicking on these icons opens up the file , folder , or application that they stand for . For example in Microsoft Windows the desktop will often have an icon for the Recycle Bin , and the icon usually looks like a trash can .
Shortcut icons also show up in other places such as folders and the start menu . These icons work the same as on the desktop .
Many computer programs use icons on buttons . When the user clicks on the button , something happens . For example , a button with an icon of a printer will usually help the user print what is currently open . While a button with a magnifying glass will let the user search for something .

Gettysburg National Cemetery is on Cemetery Hill in Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . A short time after the Battle of Gettysburg the place was bought . The Union dead were moved from shallow -LRB- not deep -RRB- burial places on the battlefield to the cemetery . It was supported by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin . The local attorney David Wills was the person who mostly bought the land , managed the building of the cemetery , and planned its ceremony . However , the basic concept and early organizing efforts were led by rival lawyer David McConaughy . The landscape architect William Saunders designed the cemetery . It was called the Soldiers ' National Cemetery at Gettysburg at first .
It was dedicated on November 19 , 1863 . Edward Everett mostly spoke at the ceremony . However , it was here that Abraham Lincoln delivered the famous Gettysburg Address .
3,512 Union soldiers were buried in the cemetery . 979 are unknown .
Central Mount Stuart is a mountain in the south of the Northern Territory , Australia . It can easily seen from the nearby Stuart Highway , which is about 6 km away . The mountain is made from dark red sandstone .
The mountain is named after the explorer John McDouall Stuart who reached the area on 22 April 1860 . He worked out that a point about 4 km -LRB- 2.5 miles -RRB- south-southwest of the mountain was the center of Australia Modern geographers do not agree with this and now place the center at Finke .
Stuart climbed to the top on 23 April 1860 , writing in his journal : `` Took Kekwick and the flag , and went to the top of the mount , but found it to be much higher and more difficult of ascent than I anticipated ... Near the top of the cone I placed a small bottle , in which there is a slip of paper , with our signatures to it , stating by whom it was raised . We then gave three hearty cheers for the flag , the emblem of civil and religious liberty , and may it be a sign to the natives that the dawn of liberty , civilization , and Christianity is about to break upon them .

Han Chinese -LRB- also called Han -RRB- -LRB- simplified Chinese : æ æ -- ; traditional Chinese : æ 1\/4 cents æ -- ; pinyin : hÃ n zÃ -RRB- is an ethnic group from China . 90 % of the people living in China and more than 97 % of the people in Taiwan are Han . Out of the entire human population in the world , 19 % are Han . Han Zu in Chinese means `` Han ethnic group . '' Another name for Han Zu can be Han Ren , which means `` Han people , '' which is written as æ ä in simplified Chinese or æ 1\/4 cents ä in traditional Chinese .
The name `` Han '' comes from the Han Dynasty that united China as one country . During the Han Dynasty , many tribes felt that they belonged to the same ethnic group . Also , the Han Dynasty is said to be the high point in Chinese civilization . During the Han Dynasty , China was able to increase its power and influence to other parts of Asia .
There are some slang words and different names for Han amongst some Han people , especially in southern China and in Vietnam . In languages like Cantonese , Hakka and Min Nan , the word `` TÃ ng RÃ n '' is also used . `` TÃ ng RÃ n '' is written as '' å '' ä '' and it literally means `` the people of Tang . '' It is pronounced `` Tong Yan '' in Cantonese . '' å '' ä '' comes from another Chinese dynasty , the Tang Dynasty . The Tang Dynasty is also another peak point of the Chinese civilization . Within English-speaking Han communities , the word `` Chinatown '' in Chinese is `` TÃ ng RÃ n JiÄ `` '' which means `` street of the Tang people . ''
Another phrase used by the Han people , especially overseas Chinese , is `` Hua Ren '' -LRB- simplified Chinese : å ä ; traditional Chinese : è ä ; pinyin : huÃ rÃ n -RRB- . It comes from `` Zhong Hua '' -LRB- simplified Chinese : ä å ; traditional Chinese : ä è ; pinyin : zhÅ ng huÃ -RRB- , a poetic name for China . The translation of this is `` ethnic Chinese '' .
Han China is one of the world 's oldest civilizations . Chinese culture dates back thousands of years . Some Han people believe they share common ancestors , distantly related to the Yellow Emperor and Yan Emperor , who existed thousands of years ago . Hence , some people of Han call themselves `` Descendants of the Yan Emperor '' or `` Descendants of the Yellow Emperor . ''
Throughout the history of China , Chinese culture has been influenced by Confucianism . Confucianism was the official philosophy throughout most of Imperial China 's history , and becoming a professional of Confucian texts was needed to be part of the imperial bureaucracy .

Their method is to get their -LRB- usually -RRB- RNA strand into a prokaryote or eukaryote cell . The RNA then takes over the cell machinery to reproduce itself and the protein coat . The cell then bursts open , speading the virus .
All viruses act in this way , and there are no free-living viruses .
Viruses are ubiquitous -LRB- everywhere -RRB- , and all organisms suffer their attacks .
Viruses are much smaller than bacteria . They were not visible until the invention of the electron microscope . A virus has a simple structure . It has no internal cellular structure , no cell wall or cell membrane . They are made of only a protein coat that holds a string of nucleic acid .
With eukaryote cells , the virus ' protein coat is able to enter the target cells via certain cell membrane receptors . With prokaryote bacteria cells , the bacteriophage physically injects the nucleic acid strand into the host cell .
When the host cell has finished making more viruses , it undergoes lysis , or breaks apart . The viruses are released and are then able to infect other cells . Viruses can remain intact for thousands of years , and will infect cells when the time and conditions are right .
Some specialised viruses are worth noting . Bacteriophages are evolved to enter bacterial cells , which have a different type of cell wall from eukaryote cell membranes . Envelope viruses , when they reproduce , cover themselves with a modified form of the host cell membrane , thus gaining an outer lipid layer that helps entry . Some of our most difficult-to-combat viruses , like influenza and HIV , use this method .
Viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus . Immune responses can also be produced by vaccines , which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection . However , some viruses including those causing AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections . Antibiotics have no effect on viruses , but several antiviral drugs have been developed .
An enormous variety of genomic structures occur in viral species . As a group they contain more structural genomic diversity than plants , animals , archaea , or bacteria . There are millions of different types of viruses , but only about 5,000 of them have been described in detail .49
A virus has either DNA or RNA genes and is called a DNA virus or a RNA virus respectively . The vast majority of viruses have RNA genomes . Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes .96 \/ 99
Viral populations do not grow through cell division , because they are acellular . Instead , they use the machinery and metabolism of a host cell to produce multiple copies of themselves , and they assemble in the cell .
The genetic material within virus particles , and the method by which the material is replicated , varies considerably between different types of viruses .
; DNA viruses : The genome replication of most DNA viruses takes place in the cell 's nucleus . Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell 's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery , and RNA processing machinery . Viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves . In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell 's nuclear membrane to access this machinery , while in bacteria it need only enter the cell .5478
; RNA viruses : Replication usually takes place in the cytoplasm . RNA viruses can be placed into four different groups depending on their modes of replication . All RNA viruses use their own RNA replicase enzymes to create copies of their genomes .79
; Reverse transcribing viruses : Reverse transcribing viruses with RNA genomes -LRB- retroviruses -RRB- use a DNA intermediate to replicate . Those with DNA genomes -LRB- pararetroviruses -RRB- use an RNA intermediate during genome replication . They are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme . An example of the first type is HIV , which is a retrovirus . Examples of the second type are the Hepadnaviridae , which includes Hepatitis B virus .88 \/ 9
The body 's first line of defense against viruses is the innate immune system . This has cells and other mechanisms which defend the host from any infection . The cells of the innate system recognize , and respond to , pathogens in a general way .
RNA interference is an important innate defense against viruses . Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA -LRB- dsRNA -RRB- . When such a virus infects a cell , it releases its RNA molecule . A protein complex called dicer sticks to it and chops the RNA into pieces . Then a biochemical pathway , called the RISC complex , starts up . This attacks the viral mRNA , and the cell survives the infection .
Rotaviruses avoid this by not uncoating fully inside the cell and by releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle 's inner capsid . The genomic dsRNA remains protected inside the core of the virion .
The production of interferon is an important host defense mechanism . This is a hormone produced by the body when viruses are present . Its role in immunity is complex ; it eventually stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cell and its close neighbors .
Vertebrates have a second , more specific , immune system . It is called the adaptive immune system . When it meets a virus , it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and render it non-infectious . Two types of antibodies are important .
The first , called IgM , is highly effective at neutralizing viruses but is produced by the cells of the immune system only for a few weeks . The second , called IgG , is produced indefinitely . The presence of IgM in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection , whereas IgG indicates an infection sometime in the past . IgG antibody is measured when tests for immunity are carried out .
Another vertebrate defense against viruses is cell-mediated immunity . It involves immune cells known as T cells . The body 's cells constantly display short fragments of their proteins on the cell 's surface , and , if a T cell recognizes a suspicious viral fragment there , the host cell is destroyed by killer T cells and the virus-specific T-cells proliferate . Cells such as macrophages are specialists at this ` antigen presentation ' .
Not all virus infections produce a protective immune response . These persistent viruses evade immune control by sequestration -LRB- hiding away -RRB- ; blocking antigen presentation ; cytokine resistance ; evading natural killer cell activity ; escape from apoptosis -LRB- cell death -RRB- , and antigenic shift -LRB- changing surface proteins -RRB- . HIV evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins on the surface of the virion . Other viruses , called neurotropic viruses , move along nerves to places the immune system can not reach .
Viruses do not belong to any of the six kingdoms . They do not meet all the requirements for being classified as a living organism because they are not active until the point of infection . However , that is just a verbal point .
Obviously , their structure and mode of operation means they have evolved from other living things , and the loss of normal structure occurs in many endoparasites . The origins of viruses in the evolutionary history of life are unclear : some may have evolved from plasmids â `` pieces of DNA that can move between cells â `` while others may have evolved from bacteria . In evolution , viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer , which increases genetic diversity .
Viruses are used widely in cell biology . Geneticists often use viruses as vectors to introduce genes into cells that they are studying . This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance , or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome . Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time , and interest in this approach is increasing , because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria .

Vasa was a big Swedish warship . The ship was built from 1626 to 1628 . The same year Vasa was ready outside Stockholm , but sank by accident on her maiden voyage -LRB- first trip -RRB- . Vasa sank because she was too heavy on top . Those who built her knew that she had problems , but they did n't dare say that to the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus . He was not in Sweden when Vasa was built and he wanted her to go fight in the Thirty Years ' War as soon as possible . There was a hearing about why Vasa sank , but no one was found guilty or judged for her sinking .
Swedish divers in diving bells brought up some of Vasas cannons from the sunken ship in the 1660s . Anders FranzÃ n found Vasa in 1956 after he had read about the ship in sources and looked for her in the water around Stockholm . The ship was brought up in 1961 and was then treated with special chemicals so that it would last for a long time . The preservation treatment took almost 20 years to complete . Vasa is now in the Vasa Museum in Stockholm , Sweden . It is a very popular place for tourists to visit . It gets more than one million visitors every year .
When Vasa was brought up there were thousands of things inside her . There were bones of people , clothes , weapons , tools , coins , food and even some of the sails . The things and Vasa have been very good for historians , because they helps them understand how it was in Sweden in the 1600s . Vasa was a very expensive ship and was one of the largest in the world . She had hundreds of sculptures , and they were painted in many colors . She was a symbol of how powerful Sweden wanted to look and how good the Swedish king was .

Soy sauce -LRB- US -RRB- or soya sauce is a fermented sauce made from soy beans -LRB- soya beans -RRB- , roasted grain , water and salt . It is commonly used in Asian cuisine and appears in some Western cuisine dishes , especially as an ingredient in Worcestershire sauce . Real soy sauces are fermented with kÅ ji -LRB- é , the mold Aspergillus oryzae or A. sojae -RRB- and other related microorganisms . Almost all soy sauce has some alcohol added during bottling . This acts as a preservative to protect it from going bad . For this reason , soy sauce should always be kept in the fridge . It should also not be put in direct light . An opened bottle of soy sauce that has been left unrefrigerated could become slightly bitter .
Although there are many types of soy sauce , all are salty and earthy-tasting brownish liquids used to season food while cooking or at the table . What some westerners can only describe as a flavorful , kind of sweet taste is a distinct basic taste called `` umami '' by the Japanese and `` xian-wei '' -LRB- é å ` , lit . fresh taste -RRB- by the Chinese .
Although this seasoning was first used in China , it is used several cuisines across Asia and is a particularly important flavoring in Japanese cuisine . However , Chinese and Japanese soy sauces are different , and it is not really possible to use one instead of another .

Atahuallpa or Atawallpa -LRB- c. 1502 â `` 1533 -RRB- was the 13th and last sovereign emperor of the Tahuantinsuyo , or Inca empire . He became emperor after defeating his younger half-brother HuÃ scar in a civil war that followed the death of their father , Inca Huayna Capac , from an infectious disease -LRB- maybe malaria or smallpox -RRB- . During the civil war , the Spaniard Francisco Pizarro arrived and captured Atahuallpa , and used him to control the Inca empire . Eventually , the Spanish executed Atahuallpa . So ended the Inca Empire -LRB- although several weak puppet successors followed him . -RRB-
On the death of their father , the Emperor Huayna Capac , and their older brother , Ninan Cuyochi , who had been the heir , the empire was divided between the two surviving brothers , HuÃ scar and Atahualpa . Huascar got the major part of it with the capital Cusco , and Atahualpa the northern parts , including Quito -LRB- now the capital of Ecuador -RRB- . For a couple of years , the two brothers reigned without problems . But Huascar demanded that Atahuallpa swear an oath to him . Atahuallpa refused , and the civil war began .
The final battle took place at Quipaipan , where Huascar was captured . Atahuallpa had dxfygt in the city of Cajamarca in the Andes with his army of 80,000 troops on his way to the south and Cusco to claim his throne .
By this time the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro had established the city of Piura , the first Spanish settlement in Peru on July of 1532 . After two months on the march , Pizarro had arrived at Cajamarca with just 168 men under his command and sent Hernando de Soto , friar Vicente de Valverde and native interpreter Felipillo to speak with Atahuallpa about the Spanish presence .
The Spanish envoys returned to Pizarro , who prepared a surprise attack against Atahuallpa 's army in what became the Battle of Cajamarca on November 16 , 1532 .
According to Spanish law the Spanish officially declared war on the Inca people . When Atahuallpa coldly asked the priest Valverde by what authority he and his people could say such things , Valverde offered him a Bible , saying that the authority came from the words in it . He examined it and then asked why did it not speak to him . He then threw it to the ground . That gave the Spaniards the excuse they needed to wage war on the Incas . They opened fire , and over the course of 2 hours more than two thousand Inca soldiers were killed . The Spanish then imprisoned Atahuallpa in the Temple of the Sun .
Atahuallpa still could not believe the Spanish intended to take control of his kingdom . He thought that if he gave them the gold and silver they sought they would leave . In exchange for his release , he agreed to fill a large room with gold and promised the Spanish twice that amount in silver . Although he was stunned by the offer , Pizarro had no intention of releasing the Inca because he needed the ruler 's influence over the native people to maintain order in the surrounding country .
But then Pizarro decided to have him executed because he feared he could be freed by an Inca General . Pizarro staged a mock trial and found Atahuallpa guilty of revolting against the Spanish and murdering HuÃ scar , his own brother . Atahuallpa was sentenced to execution by burning . He was horrified , since the Inca believed that the soul would not be able to go on to the afterlife if the body were burned . Friar Vicente de Valverde , who had earlier offered the Bible to Atahuallpa , intervened again , telling Atahuallpa that if he agreed to convert to Christianity he would convince the rest to commute the sentence . Atahualpa agreed to be baptized into the Christian faith . He was given the name Juan Santos Atahualpa and then was strangled with a garrote instead of being burned . Atahuallpa died on August 29 , 1533 . Atahuallpa was succeeded by his brother , the puppet Inca Tupac Huallpa , and later by another brother Manco Inca Yupanqui .

Tarbosaurus was a large carnivorous theropod dinosaur from Asia , especially Mongolia and China . It was a tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that flourished between 70 and 65 million years ago , at the end of the Cretaceous period .
Tarbosaurus lived in a humid floodplain criss-crossed by river channels . In this environment , it was a predator at the top of the food chain , probably preying on other large dinosaurs like the hadrosaur Saurolophus or the sauropod Nemegtosaurus .
Like its close North American relative Tyrannosaurus rex , it had a large head and powerful jaws , but was not top heavy . Its huge skull was comparatively thin and light , with large air pockets . Many of its bones were hollow , making them strong but light , so they did not add excessive weight to this large predator . Its forlimbs were small with two fingers , as with its larger relative . The small , two-fingered , front limb is absolutely distinctive of tyrannosaurids .
The three-toed hind limbs were long and thick , supporting the body in a bipedal posture . The long , heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso and placed the center of gravity over the hips .
Its skull was similar to that of Tyrannosaurus , but more rigid . Also , because its skull was not so broad at the back , it did not have binocular vision like Tyrannosaurus .
Some scientists have hypothesized that the more rigid skull of Tarbosaurus was an adaptation to hunting the massive sauropods found in the location , which did not exist in most of North America during the later Cretaceous . `` Both Asiatic and North American ... tyrannosaurines -LRB- NAT -RRB- hunted large prey , whilst also being opportunistic scavengers . However , the prey available to them were obviously different ... the adult T. rex ... probably specialized in bringing down large horned dinosaurs , like Triceratops ... but this group was absent outside North America . Thus , the Mongolian tyrannosaurines were forced to feed on sauropods ... These differences in typical prey items might have exerted different selective pressures , concerning hunting strategy and mechanical requirements maximizing their success rate as predators '' . `` The new material studied in this paper allows us to speculate if the tyrannosaurines can be divided into NATs and an Asiatic group '' .

The United States Republican Party is one of the two biggest political parties in the United States of America . The other large party is the Democratic Party . The United States also has many other small parties known as third parties .
The Republicans are often called `` the right '' or `` conservatives '' . The Republican Party itself is also known as the G.O.P. , which stands for `` Grand Old Party . '' The symbol of the Republican party is the elephant . This symbol was first used in 1874 in a political cartoon -LRB- pictured -RRB- .
The Republican National Committee is the main organization for the Republican Party in all 50 states . Reince Priebus is the current RNC Chairman .
The Republican Party is not the same political party as the Democratic-Republican Party .
The Republican Party was founded in Ripon , Wisconsin in 1854 . Its formation was based around opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 , which would allow each territory to allow slavery if they wanted to . It was founded by previous members of the Free-Soil Party and the Whig Party . They wanted to stop the expansion of slavery because they believed that it was against the ideals of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence . Some founders wanted to abolish slavery everywhere in the United States . The first Republican candidate for president was John C. Fremont in 1856 .
As the Whig Party collapsed , the Republicans became the second major party -LRB- the Democratic Party being the first -RRB- . In 1860 , Abraham Lincoln , the first Republican president was elected . For the rest of the second half of the 19th century , the country had mostly Republican presidents . From 1860 until 1912 the Republicans lost the presidential election just twice -LRB- non-consecutively to Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1884 and 1892 -RRB- .
Republicans believed in protectionism -LRB- the belief that raising taxes on trades with foreign nations would protect the U.S. economy -RRB- during the second half of the 19th century and during the early half of the 20th century .
After World War I , the 1920 's had 3 Republican presidents : Warren Harding , Calvin Coolidge , and Herbert Hoover . It was called the Republican Decade for that reason . Harding and Coolidge made a plan for the economy which lowered taxes , cut government spending , and regulated the economy less .
Near the end of the decade , the stock market crashed and the Great Depression was beginning . During the Great Depression , Republicans lost popularity and Democrats came into power and remained in power until 1953 , when Dwight Eisenhower began his first of two consecutive terms as president . -LRB- He was re-elected in 1956 . -RRB- Richard Nixon lost the election in 1960 , but was elected president on the Republican ticket in 1968 and again in 1972 .
Ronald Reagan , an actor who has been a conservative political activist for decades , was elected as president in 1980 . This began a conservative era which would last for until 1992 . He served two terms and his successor George H.W. Bush served one term . Reagan renewed many ideas which had left behind in the past such as limited government in the economy and strengthening the military .
Bill Clinton -LRB- a Democrat -RRB- was elected president in 1992 , but a new Congress was elected in 1994 , and Republicans gained control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate . They voted against many of Clinton 's ideas and proposed ideas of their own such as a line item veto and a balanced budget amendment .
The Republicans lost control of Congress during 2006 -LRB- possibly due to Republican president George W. Bush 's unpopularity -RRB- . Democrat Barack Obama was elected in 2008 . Those two factors weakened the conservative movement .
Currently , the Republican Party is identified as conservative and right-wing .

SimCity is a computer game where the player has to build a city . They can do whatever they want to their city . It can be build it up from the ground or it can be destroyed by a hurricane or a UFO .
Sim City was made by game maker Will Wright and first released by the company Maxis . They are now owned by Electronic Arts . The game was first officially released in 1989 .
It was very popular because the game had no end . A player could not win or lose . This was the start of all simulation games .
At the start , the player has to build power plants . Power plants make power so the city can have electricity . By building power lines , power is connected to the different areas of the city . Water needs to be pumped in from a river using pipes to connect them to the city .
Smaller areas are marked out . These are made either residential , commercial , or industrial zones . Zones are the only places where buildings can develop . Every city needs the right amount of each zone otherwise the city will not grow .
Roads , schools and hospitals must all be built for the city to get better . Parks and libraries make more people want to move to the city . Railways and highways provide ways to connect to other neighborhoods .
After the first game , many more were created . These were made up of three games , with spin-offs and expansion packs . These were :

Sexual orientation is a term that means what kinds of people a person loves or has sexual or romantic feelings about . A person can love somebody of the same gender -LRB- sex -RRB- , somebody of the other gender , both , or neither .
Not everyone agrees that some of these last terms are really sexual orientations . For example , a person can have a fetish and still be either heterosexual , homosexual , or bisexual . A person can also be transgender or transsexual and still be either heterosexual , homosexual , or bisexual .
Many people have been discriminated against because of their sexual orientation . In many cultures , people who are homosexual or bisexual have been teased -LRB- made fun of -RRB- , fired from their job , or subjected to violence because of who they are . In many countries and states , there are laws against having sex with somebody of the same gender , and people can be put in jail because of who they have sex with . In the United States , these laws were struck down -LRB- repealed -RRB- by the United States Supreme Court in the last few years .

Krushchev eventually won the battle for power against Malenkov , and in 1957 he was forced to leave his position in the Party Politburo , because he formed a team with Nikolai Bulganin , Vyacheslav Molotov , and Lazar Kaganovich , and together they tried to throw Khrushchev out of power . In 1961 , Malenkov was kicked out of the Party and forced to move to Kazakhstan .
Along with Krushchev , Malenkov was one of a few important members of Stalin 's group of partners -LRB- called the `` inner circle '' -RRB- who died a natural death , and was not executed .
Together with Lavrentiy Beria & Krushchev , Malenkov began process of destalinization , completing the process in 1961 .

Fritz MÃ 1\/4 ller -LRB- 31 March 1821 â `` 21 May 1897 -RRB- , was a German biologist and doctor who went to live in southern Brazil . There he studied the natural history . He was an early supporter of Darwinism , and lived in Brazil for the rest of his life . MÃ 1\/4 llerian mimicry is named after him .
Unlike most of his contemporaries in Britain , MÃ 1\/4 ller had what would be seen today as a normal scientific education at the universities of Berlin and Greifswald , culminating in a doctoral degree . Then , he decided to study medicine . As a medical student , he began to question religion and in 1846 became an atheist . Despite completing the course , he did not graduate because he refused to swear the graduation oath , which contained the phrase `` so help me God and his sacred Gospel '' .
MÃ 1\/4 ller was disappointed by the failure of the Prussian Revolution in 1848 , and realized there might be implications for his life and career . As a result , he emigrated to South Brazil in 1852 , with his brother August and their wives , to join Hermann Blumenau 's new colony in the State of Santa Catarina . The colony , near the coast on the ItajaÃ River , was called Blumenau . In Brazil , MÃ 1\/4 ller , living with his wife Caroline , became a farmer , doctor , teacher and biologist , sometimes employed by the provincial government , sometimes surviving on his own efforts , sometimes defending against Indians but always collecting evidence of life in the Atlantic forest . The climate here is sub-tropical , and the vegetation typical of the Brazilian coast : it is not rain forest .
In 1876 he was appointed as Travelling Naturalist to the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro . This was the ideal post for him : it gave him the opportunity to range over the whole of the ItajaÃ system and study anything that interested him . A series of reports published in the Archivos of the National Museum record this work .
At last this , the best period of his life , was brought to an end indirectly , by the overthrow of the liberal monarchy of Dom Pedro II in 1889 . The new Brazilian Republic was riddled with corruption and nepotism , and eventually there was a civil war in 1893-5 . Travelling naturalists were to be based in Rio de Janeiro , and instructions were sent out . MÃ 1\/4 ller refused point-blank and was dismissed , as was von Ihering in SÃ # o Paulo .
In his retirement years MÃ 1\/4 ller received many letters of support and offers of financial help -LRB- from Darwin , amongst others -RRB- . His cousin Alfred MÃ ller visited him , and eventually became his biographer . His rewards during life from the Brazilian state were minor ; but his reputation now stands high . He was one of a half-dozen great naturalists to visit and work in South America during the nineteenth century . Humboldt , Darwin , Wallace , Bates , Spruce â '' and Fritz MÃ 1\/4 ller . He was the only one of these to settle in Brazil for the rest of his life . A statue was erected to MÃ 1\/4 ller in Blumenau in 1929 .
1821-41 : Childhood and schooling , near Erfurt . 1841-49 : University and medical school , mostly at Greifswald and Berlin . 1849-52 : Respite in the countryside . 1852-56 : Emigration with brother August and their wives ; lived at and near Blumenau on the river ItajaÃ . 1856-67 : At Desterro -LRB- the provincial capital -RRB- on the island of Santa Caterina . He was mathematics teacher at the LycÃ e. 1867-76 : Return to the ItajaÃ Valley as a minor provincial official . Worked as a botanist and as an advisor to farmers . 1876-91 : Travelling naturalist of the National Museum . Explored throughout the ItajaÃ system . Dismissed by refusing order to live in Rio de Janeiro . 1891-97 : Last years ; visited 1890-93 by cousin Alfred MÃ ller .
During his life MÃ 1\/4 ller published oved 70 papers , mostly in German-language periodicals , some in English and Portuguese . The topics covered a range of natural history topics in entomology , marine zoology , and botany .
MÃ 1\/4 ller 's great discovery concerned the resemblance between two or more unpalatable species which are protected from predators capable of learning . The protection is often a noxious chemical , perhaps gained from the larva eating a particulat plant ; or it may be a sting or other defense . It is an advantage for such potential prey to advertise their status in a way clearly perceptible to their predators ; this is called aposematic or warning colouration . In Muller 's case the prey were butterflies , and the predators usually birds or reptiles .
The aposematic colors are most often some combination of red , yellow , black , white , whereas palatable animals are usually cryptic . The noxious animals may display by slow flying , and in general are prominently visible . Noxious animals usually have thick , leathery cuticles through which , at certain points , they extrude noxious fluids when pecked ; they will often survive a ` trial ' .
In MÃ 1\/4 llerian mimicry an advantage is gained when unpalatable species resemble each other , especially when the predator has a good memory for color -LRB- as birds , for instance , do have -RRB- . Thus one trial may work to dissuade a bird from several species of butterfly which all fly the same ` flag ' . Brazilian butterflies provide some of the most extraordinary examples of mimicry , and MÃ 1\/4 ller , Bates and Wallace all had lengthy experience of this . All three traveller-naturalists believed firmly that such systems of mimicry could only come about by means of natural selection , and all of them wrote about it .
One of his favorite topics was the life habits of the stingless honey-bees Melipoma and Trigona . They are protected by a venom which they squirt when disturbed . The local name for them is Cagafogo -LRB- fire-shitter -RRB- .
Another discovery was the dimorphism in midges of the family Blepharicereidae . There are two female forms with different mouth-parts : one sucks blood , the other takes nectar , as does the male . To prove the point to skeptics , he sexed the flies carefully , and reared them from pupae .
By studying living termites MÃ 1\/4 ller was able to correct many errors to be found in text-books . For example , their caste system is organised quite differently from ants , since the castes contain members of both sexes , whereas in hymenoptera the castes are unisexual and the males are haploid . Termites are placed in a different order from ants , the Isoptera .
Much of MÃ 1\/4 ller 's botany was stimulated by the series of botanical works published by Darwin in the years after the Origin . MÃ 1\/4 ller made contributions in all these fields . After Darwin 's Fertilisation of Orchids -LRB- 1862 -RRB- he spent years of work on orchids , sending observations to his brother Hermann and to Darwin . Darwin used some of this work in his second edition of 1877 , and Hermann later became famous for his work on pollination . On Climbing plants -LRB- Darwin 1867 -RRB- MÃ 1\/4 ller sent a letter to Darwin listing 40 genera of climbing plants classified by their method of climbing . The next few months saw more observations , which Darwin had translated and published as MÃ 1\/4 ller 's first paper in English .
MÃ 1\/4 ller became a strong supporter of Darwin . He wrote FÃ 1\/4 r Darwin in 1864 , arguing that Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution by natural selection was correct , and that Brazilian crustaceans and their larvae could be affected by adaptations at any growth stage . This was translated into English as Facts and Arguments for Darwin in 1869 . If MÃ 1\/4 ller had a weakness it was that his writing was much less readable than that of Darwin or Wallace ; both the German and English editions are hard reading indeed , which has limited the appreciation of this significant book .
Extensive correspondence exists between MÃ 1\/4 ller and Darwin , and MÃ 1\/4 ller also corresponded with Alexander Agassiz , Ernst Krause , and Ernst Haeckel .

Hurricane Vince was an unusual hurricane that began in the northeast Atlantic Ocean . It was part of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season . The waters where it formed were thought to be too cold for tropical cyclones to exist . Vince was the 20th named storm and 12th hurricane of the season .
The storm that became Vince started out as an extratropical cyclone . It became a subtropical storm on October 8 to the southeast of the Azores . The National Hurricane Center -LRB- NHC -RRB- did not officially give the storm a name until the next day . Vince grew into a hurricane before beginning to weaken at sea . On October 11 , it made landfall on the Iberian Peninsula in Spain . At that time , it was a tropical depression . It may have been the first storm to hit the area since a hurricane in 1842 . Vince died out over Spain . However , it dropped rain in the country . What was left of the storm passed into the Mediterranean Sea .
On October 5 , a storm now known as the 2005 Azores subtropical storm was absorbed by another low pressure area . It then began to develop and become more organized . It became a subtropical cyclone early on October 8 . The storm was 580 miles -LRB- 930 km -RRB- southeast of Lajes in the Azores . The National Hurricane Center -LRB- NHC -RRB- did not name the system Vince at the time , because the waters here were thought to be too cold for tropical or subtropical cyclones to exist . The storm slowly became more tropical , with a warm center . It became a tropical storm the next day in water cooler than 24 Â C -LRB- 75 Â F -RRB- , colder than the 26.5 Â C -LRB- 80 Â F -RRB- usually needed for tropical storms .
After becoming a tropical storm , it had an eye , a clear opening at the center of the storm . The NHC named it Tropical Storm Vince , but at the time , it was not known whether Vince was tropical or subtropical . A later analysis of the storm found that Vince became tropical before it was given a name . The storm 's eye became more settled and had a diameter of 15 mi -LRB- 25 km -RRB- . The storm also became stronger ; it reached its highest force on October 9 . At the time , it had wind speeds of 75 mph -LRB- 120 km\/h -RRB- , a very weak Category 1 hurricane on the Saffirâ `` Simpson Hurricane Scale . One NHC weather forecaster said that `` if it looks like a hurricane , it probably is , despite its environment and unusual location '' .
Hurricane Vince quickly began to weaken because wind shear began to erode it . Vince weakened to a tropical storm . A type of weather system called a trough moved towards Vince from the northwest It pulled thunderstorms related to Vince away from the storm , and its center quickly moved to the east . On October 10 , two short bursts of thunderstorms surprised forecasters . However , because the water was so cold , the storm kept weakening . Vince became weaker as it came closer to the Iberian Peninsula . It became a tropical depression on October 11 . This was just before it made its landfall in Huelva , Spain . The fast-moving tropical depression quickly died out over land . What was left of the cyclone moved across southern Spain . It moved into the Mediterranean Sea south of Alicante early on October 12 .
The Spanish Center for Emergency Coordination declared a rain pre-emergency for the province of CastellÃ n. They were afraid that Hurricane Vince would bring rains which would flood the area . The Instituto Nacional de MeteorologÃ a -LRB- INM -RRB- issued a bulletin . It warned of a 40 % chance of flooding . Four autonomous regions -LRB- Asturias , CataluÃ a , Castile and LeÃ n and Galicia -RRB- issued flood warnings . Canarias issued a wind warning . Fishing fleets from Spain off the Andalusian coast went back to port . They were hit by the storm while anchored . The storm did not hit them in the open ocean .
Spain had been fighting a record drought that year . They welcomed the rains brought by Vince 's remnants . In two days the storm brought a lot of rain to the province of A CoruÃ a. This eased the sinking water levels in the reservoirs . But this also caused bad traffic and small floods . In Cordoba province , the A-303 , A-306 and OC-293 roads were slightly flooded . The entrance of the University of A CoruÃ a was blocked for some time . It was blocked by flood waters on October 11 . A nearby roundabout was submerged . There were limited damages . No one died in the storm . The highest winds reported on land were 48 mph -LRB- 77 km\/h -RRB- . These winds were reported at Jerez , Spain . Some ships reported stronger winds . The rainfall as a result of the hurricane was like normal rains from temperate systems . Only one to two inches -LRB- 25 to 50 mm -RRB- of rain fell . Using the words of a song in the film My Fair Lady , National Hurricane Center forecaster James Franklin in the Tropical Cyclone Report for Vince wrote , `` the rain in Spain was mainly less than 2 inches , although 3.30 inches -LRB- 84 mm -RRB- fell in the plain at Cordoba . ''
Hurricane Vince began in an odd place , where tropical cyclones are not usually found . However , it does not hold any important records . Tropical Storm Alberto of the 1988 season formed farther north than any other storm , at 41.5 Â N. Also , Hurricane Ginger of the 1967 season formed at 18.1 Â W , the farthest east of any tropical cyclones . Hurricane Vince became a hurricane further east than any known storm , at 18.9 Â W. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when wind speeds grow higher than 74 m.
The National Hurricane Center said that Vince was the first tropical cyclone known to hit the Iberian Peninsula . However , some documents claim that the 1842 Spain hurricane struck the Iberian Peninsula on October 29 , 1842 . That hurricane may have been stronger . More recently , Tropical Storm Grace formed farther north than Vince .
When Subtropical Storm Vince began on October 8 , it was earliest in a season that the twenty-first tropical or subtropical storm formed . It was 38 days ahead of the record before that , which was set by Tropical Storm 21 of the 1933 season . Because Vince did not cause bad damage , the World Meteorological Organization did not retire -LRB- stop using -RRB- the name Vince . It will be on the list of names for the 2011 season .

South West England is one of the regions of England . It has the largest area of all regions , and reaches from Gloucestershire and Wiltshire to Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly . This includes the area often known as the West Country , and much of Wessex . The size of the region is shown by the fact that the northern part of Gloucestershire , near Chipping Campden , is as close to the Scottish border as it is to the tip of Cornwall .
Traditionally , the South West of England has been well known for producing Cheddar cheese , named after Cheddar in the Mendip Hills , for Devon cream teas , and for Somerset cider . It is now probably equally well known as the home of the Eden Project , Aardman Animations , the Glastonbury festival , trip hop music , Cornwall 's seafood restaurants , and surfing beaches . Two National Parks and four World Heritage Sites lie in this region .

The BahÃ ' Ã Faith is a religion started in the 1800s by BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h who was born in Tehran , Iran . Followers of this religion call themselves BahÃ ' Ã s. The name BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h is Arabic for `` The Glory of God '' . `` Glory '' is a word that means `` importance '' , `` power '' , and `` beauty '' . BahÃ ' Ã s believe that BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h is a representation of God , or speaks for God , and he shows people God 's importance , beauty , and brightness .
BahÃ ' Ã s are monotheists -LRB- which means that they believe in one God -RRB- . They believe that BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h carried a message from God . BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h said that he was not the only person to carry a message from God and that he was not the last to carry a message from God . He taught that the people who started the other major religions also represented and carried messages from God , such as Jesus , Moses , Abraham , Muhammad , Krishna , the Buddha and others . He called these people `` Manifestations of God . '' They believe that the messages from the Manifestations of God get more and more difficult to understand . They say the ones that came earlier on had a more simple message than the ones that came later . Because God is greater than the whole universe , BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h said that human beings can not completely know God . He said that God wants people to know as much about him as they can . BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h wrote that God sends special people to manifest -LRB- show -RRB- himself to ordinary humans . Without the Manifestations of God we could not know God . Because BahÃ ' Ã s believe that the God they pray to is the same God that Abraham spoke to , they believe that they are also an Abrahamic religion . BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h is considered the prophet of the present day . BahÃ ' Ã s say that he is not the last prophet of God . They think there will be more in the future , but there will be no more until 1000 years after Baha ` u ` llah 's death .
The BahÃ ' Ã Faith began on 1844 when a man called the BÃ b said he had a message from God . He said that it was his job to make sure that people were ready for the most important message from God who would be sent soon . This started a religion , followers of this religion were called BÃ bÃ s. Many people became BÃ bÃ s in the country of Iran , which was called Persia at the time , and this made the government of Persia and the Muslim priests angry . They arrested and killed the Bab and his followers . Even though this happened , people still followed this religion .
Before BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h said he had a message from God , he was a member of the religion that was started by the BÃ b. He became very famous among the BÃ bÃ s. When the BÃ b was killed , some BÃ bÃ s got very angry and tried to kill the king of Persia , even though BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h told them not to kill him . When the Babis were caught , the government put many BÃ bÃ s in jail , including BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h. While in jail at Tehran , BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h said he saw an angel that he called the `` maid of heaven '' . The angel told him that he had to teach a message from God to the people of the world . The angel said that God would rescue and protect him so that he could teach this message . Eventually , he was released from jail and the government of Persia made him move to Baghdad , which was then controlled by the king of the Ottoman Empire .
While Baha ` u ` llah was in Baghdad , he had many problems , but he also made many friends . The government of Persia was unhappy that he seemed to be doing well in Baghdad , and so they asked the Ottoman Empire to move him further away from Persia . When he was about to leave , in 1863 , he held a festival for 12 days on a small island in the Tigris river , which he called Ridvan , which means paradise . There he told some of his closest friends and family that he was the promised one of all of the major religions , and that eventually the whole world would know his message .
Eventually the Ottoman Empire sent him to many different cities , including Constantinople , Adrianople , Alexandria , and eventually Akka . He was in different jails this whole time , and the city of Akka had a big wall around it , and it was one big jail . While he was in Baghdad , and after , he wrote many books and letters to answer questions that his friends and followers asked him . At one point he was poisoned , so that he could not write anymore because his hands shook so badly . After that , he had someone write down what he said . When he was even older , his oldest son , ` Abdu ` l-Bah Ã arranged to have him move into a house near Mount Carmel , and he stayed there until he finally died in 1892 .
After he died , people followed ` Abdu ` l-Bah Ã . BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h had written that ` Abdu ` l-Bah Ã had special powers , and that God would make sure that if ` Abdu ` l-Bah Ã explained anything that BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h said , then the BahÃ ' Ã s should believe that explanation . ` Abdu ` l-Bah Ã also wrote a lot of letters and gave talks , and eventually visited Paris , London , Montreal , New York City , San Francisco and other cities in the west . This helped the BahÃ ' Ã Faith to spread in Europe and North America . He died in 1921 . He left a will , where he told the BahÃ ' Ã s to follow his grandson , Shoghi Effendi .
Shoghi Effendi was born in 1900 and was only a young man when his grandfather died and he became the leader of the BahÃ ' Ã s. He helped make the different agencies and councils that run the BahÃ ' Ã Faith today , and organized the religion in many ways . He also wrote many books and letters to explain the teachings of his grandfather and great-grandfather . He lived until 1957 and died in England .
After Shoghi Effendi died , the BahÃ ' Ã s did not have leaders for six years , because Shoghi Effendi had not left a will . Shoghi Effendi did have helpers , who did not think they were allowed to lead the BahÃ ' Ã s , so they helped the BahÃ ' Ã Community follow the last plan that Shoghi Effendi left them , and at the end of that plan , in 1963 , they organized an election to form the Universal House of Justice , which BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h wrote about . The Universal House of Justice has led the BahÃ ' Ã s ever since .
BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h wrote many books and letters , and ` Abdu ` l-Bah Ã -LRB- whose name means `` Servant of Glory '' -RRB- also wrote many books and letters which BahÃ ' Ã s see as special . Finally , BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h 's great-grandson Shoghi Effendi wrote lots of books and letters which BahÃ ' Ã s use to better understand the writings of BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h and ` Abdu ` l-Bah Ã .
BahÃ ' Ã s also believe that the Bible , the Qur ` an , and other books from other religions are special , but do not read them as much as they read the writings of BahÃ ` u 'll Ã h and ` Abdu ` l-Bah Ã . For Baha ` is , the Qur ` an is special among the books from other religions ; they see it as completely written by God
There are five or six million BahÃ ' Ã s in the world , of all peoples and languages . The BahÃ ' Ã Faith looks different in different countries , because there are few rituals , so BahÃ ' Ã s can include their own culture in the way they celebrate BahÃ ' Ã events , say prayers , etc.
BahÃ ' Ã s meet every nineteen -LRB- 19 -RRB- days in a meeting called a `` Feast '' . There does not have to be food , but there usually is . These meetings start with prayers and usually someone reads aloud some holy writings . Sometimes there is music and song , sometimes plays , sometimes just quiet time or meditation . After this time , which BahÃ ' Ã s call the `` devotional '' time in a feast , they have a community discussion . All sorts of topics can be discussed here that are important to the members . BahÃ ' Ã s say that this is a `` consultative '' time , where BahÃ ' Ã s can consult with each other . After this , there is a social time , where people can share food , drink -LRB- not alcohol -RRB- , and sometimes here there is also music , or plays , or presentations , or other entertainment . This time is just so that the BahÃ ' Ã s in that city can get to know each other and become better friends .
BahÃ ' Ã s often do not have one place they get together , except in large cities . In smaller places they usually get together in each others ' houses . Some larger cities have `` BahÃ ' Ã Centers '' which can be used for community meetings , classes , or for meetings of committees and other councils . -LRB- see Institutions below -RRB-
In a very few cities in the world , there are BahÃ ' Ã temples . These temples are on each continent .
BahÃ ' Ã s are organized in a worldwide community . They do not have priests . Everyone is responsible for their own prayers . BahÃ ' Ã s are also responsible for reading their holy books for themselves and for learning about their religion . Baha ` is elect leaders for their community , to help organize their activities , and to deal with problems between members , and to decide things that are not obvious from the scriptures . These are called Spiritual Assemblies , but will one day be called Houses of Justice .
There is one House of Justice , which BahÃ ' Ã s call the Universal House of Justice , which leads the whole worldwide BahÃ ' Ã community . BahÃ ' Ã s elect this House of Justice every five years , but only once each year for National and Local Spiritual Assemblies .
The Rapture -LRB- meaning `` to carry to another place '' is an future event in Christian theology where Jesus Christ will return to Earth to bring his followers to Heaven . In Christianity it is believed that following this amazing event , the world will go through what is called the tribulation . Then later following , will come the millennium -LRB- a thousand years -RRB- .
The tribulation -LRB- or the great tribulation -RRB- is supposed theory of life after the rapture . Most Christians agree that the period lasts around seven years . During these years , it is believed that the Antichrist will come to power and control the world .
The Millennium is the period following the rapture , and the tribulation , that Christians believe they will live in glory on the Earth . They also believe that Jesus Christ will be in total control over earth for 1,000 years -LRB- a millennium -RRB- .
In 1950 , the novel Raptured by Ernest Angley was published , and in 1995 , the first of the Left Behind series was published . These and other books have made the story of the rapture and the tribulation popular .
The Rapture story has been retold in many movies . The most well-known production company is Cloud Ten Pictures . Which have created the Left Behind film series -LRB- Left Behind : The Movie , Left Behind II : Tribulation Force , and Left Behind : World at War -RRB- , as well as several other movies . Some other notable end times movies are A Thief in the Night and The Omega Code .

Kim Jong-il -LRB- ê ì ì 1\/4 ; é ` æ # æ -- -RRB- -LRB- born February 16 , 1941 -RRB- has been the leader of North Korea since his father 's death in 1994 . He is the son of Kim Il-S Å ng . Official North Korean propaganda says he was born on Mount Paektu -LRB- a holy mountain in Korea -RRB- , but most historians think that he was actually born near Chabarowsk in the Soviet Union . Inside North Korea , it is the law that no one can try to replace him as leader of the country . He is sometimes referred to as the `` Dear Leader '' , but this is not an official title . His official title is `` Chairman of the National Defense Commission of North Korea '' , `` Supreme Commander of the Korean People 's Army '' and `` General Secretary of the Workers ' Party of Korea '' . Many people in North Korea have been imprisoned or killed for speaking out against the Kim regime . Almost everyone in North Korea wears a small pin with a picture of Kim JÅ ng-Il or Kim Il-S Å ng on it .
Kim is a Stalinist who also believes in the North Korean Communist philosophy of Juche -LRB- self-reliance -RRB- . He is afraid to travel on aeroplanes and travels only on trains . He is famous known for his love of cinema and luxury goods , especially caviar and Hennessey brand cognac , even though North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world . Former United States Secretary of State Madeline Albright once gave Kim a present of a basketball autographed by Michael Jordan when he visited North Korea because Kim is a fan of the National Basketball Association and of Jordan .

Tofu , sometimes also called doufu -LRB- usually used in Chinese recipes -RRB- or bean curd -LRB- literal translation -RRB- , is a food made by coagulating soy milk , and then pressing the resulting curds into blocks . The making of tofu from soy milk is similar to the technique of making cheese from milk . Wheat gluten , or seitan , in its steamed and fried forms , is often mistakenly called `` tofu '' in Asian or vegetarian dishes .
In Japan , tofu is a common food , used in miso soup or as a hot dish .
China has more kinds of tofu than Japan and various tofu foods .
In America , tofu is becoming more popular , since Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke on the effect of tofu on the TV . Today , Americans buy tofu at the grocery store . The word â tofuâ takes root in common use .
In Korea , Vietnam , Cambodia , Thailand , Myanmar and Indonesia , tofu is daily food .
Tofu is rich in textured vegetable protein . Calorie is relatively low . Dietary fiber is a little for process . More and more American and European use it as health food .
On Sunday 29 April 2001 the United Kingdom Government held a census . This was the 19th UK Census . United Kingdom Census 2001 was started by the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales , the General Register Office for Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency . It was the first census to ask people in England , Scotland and Wales about their religion .
Geometric abstraction is a form of abstract art based on the use of geometric forms in non-representational compositions . This art is not meant to depict our everyday visual world , but instead uses the shapes of basic geometry .
Wassily Kandinsky , one of the forerunners of pure non-objective painting , was among the first modern artists to explore this geometric approach in his abstract work . Other examples of pioneer abstractionists such as Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian have also embraced this approach towards abstract painting .
Geometric abstraction is not just an invention of 20th century avant-garde artists or movements . It is present in many cultures throughout history both as decorative motifs and as art pieces themselves .
Islamic art , in its prohibition of depicting religious figures , is a prime example of this geometric pattern-based art . It existed centuries before the modern movement in Europe , and in many ways influenced this Western school . Geometric patterns were often used in the architecture of Islamic civilisations from the 7th century-20th century , to visually connect spirituality with science and art .
Abstract art has also historically been likened to music in its ability to convey emotional or expressive feelings and ideas without reliance upon or reference to recognizable objective forms already existent in reality . Wassily Kandinsky has discussed this connection between music and painting , as well as how the practice of classical composition had influenced his work , at length in his seminal essay Concerning the Spiritual in Art .

Risk is the possibility of something bad happening . People use the word risk when they are actually talking about probability ; it means , they want to say how likely something is to happen .
People often take risks . This means that they do something that is risky , i.e. that might be dangerous . There is a possibility that something bad might happen .
In epidemiology , risk is defined as the number of events divided by the number of people prone to that event . For example , if the risk of neonatal death in a population is reported as 1\/1000 , it means that from each 1000 babies born , 1 is likely to die .
Risk is different from prevalence . Prevalence refers to the number of people with a disease in a population , while risk means the number of new cases , divided by the number of people who could possibly become a case -LRB- for example , those who had a chance to be exposed to the disease -RRB- .
A risk assessment is a list of things that could go wrong . In many Western countries , when teachers take children on an outing they may have to fill in a risk assessment form which lists all the possible dangers and says what they should do to stop bad things from happening -LRB- e.g. accidents or children getting lost -RRB- .
Stan Laurel -LRB- June 16 , 1890 â `` February 23 , 1965 -RRB- , was an British actor comedian , writer and director .
Born in Lancashire , England . He began his career in the late 1910s , to work together , to the great Charles Chaplin . Among his first works in this silent comedy short , Nuts in May -LRB- 1917 -RRB- , Phoney Photos -LRB- 1918 -RRB- , Just Rambling Along -LRB- 1918 -RRB- and Do You Love Your Wife ? -LRB- 1919 -RRB- , by Hal Roach , Mud and Sand -LRB- 1922 -RRB- , When Knights Were Cold -LRB- 1923 -RRB- , Smithy -LRB- 1924 -RRB- , Postage Due -LRB- 1924 -RRB- , Monsieur Do n't Care -LRB- 1924 -RRB- , and many more .
In 1918 he stars with Oliver Hardy , in the short silent film The Lucky Dog . That there will be the beginning of the famous duo , together again years later to form Laurel and Hardy . His first Hal Roach , short with Hardy was Duck Soup -LRB- 1927 -RRB- , followed by Slipping Wives -LRB- 1927 -RRB- , Love 'Em and Weep -LRB- 1927 -RRB- , Why Girls Love Sailors -LRB- 1927 -RRB- , The Second 100 Years -LRB- 1927 -RRB- , Call of the Cuckoo -LRB- 1927 -RRB- , The Battle of the Century -LRB- 1927 -RRB- . Short were a great success and catapulted the duo to stardom . They continued jump shorts until 1931 , his first feature film Pardon Us , by James Parrott . Her biggest movies were The Devil 's Brother -LRB- 1933 -RRB- , Sons of the Desert -LRB- 1934 -RRB- , Way Out West -LRB- 1937 -RRB- , The Flying Deuces -LRB- 1939 -RRB- .
His last film was Utopia -LRB- 1951 -RRB- .
Stan Laurel also did some work in television as NBC live show This is your Life , together with Oliver Hardy . He also made â â appearances on the BBC , Grand Order of Water Rats -LRB- 1955 -RRB- , where they performed a show reliving the old days of Laurel and Hardy .

Western Armenia , also referred to as Byzantine Armenia , later Turkish Armenia , or Ottoman Armenia is a term coined following the division of Greater Armenia between Byzantine Empire -LRB- Western Armenia -RRB- and Persia -LRB- Eastern Armenia -RRB- in 387 AC .
After the death of Armenian king Arshak III , in 390 AC , the Western Armenia was governed by Greek generals . In the 7th century Western Armenia was one of the centers of Pavlikian Christian popular sect . Since 9th century the most part of Western Armenia included Vaspurakan and Taron was under the rule of Bagratid dynasty of Armenia . Then the Zakarid Armenia of 13-14th centuries included some parts of Western Armenia .
After Turkish-Persian wars of 1602-1639 Western Armenia became part of Ottoman Empire . Since Russo-Turkish War , 1828-1829 that term is referred to the Armenian-populated historical regions of the Ottoman Empire that remained under Ottoman rule after the eastern part was ceded to the Russian Empire .
Western -LRB- Ottoman -RRB- Armenia was composed of six vilayets -LRB- vilÃ cents yat - Ä sitte -RRB- , the vilayets of Erzurum , Van , Bitlis , Diyarbekir , Kharput , and Sivas . After the collapse of Ottoman Empire Western Armenia remained under Turkish rule , and in 1894 â `` 96 and 1915 Turkey perpetrated systematic massacres and forced deportations of Armenians .
After the Armenian genocide the distinct Western Armenian dialect of the Armenian language -LRB- recognized as one of the major dialects of Armenian -RRB- is spoken primarily in Istanbul , Lebanon , Egypt , other parts of Armenian diaspora , and formerly in eastern Turkey . It differs orthographically from Eastern Armenian , there are also phonological differences . In some parts of the diaspora , the Armenian schools , such as L' Ã cole ArmÃ nienne Sourp Hagop and the Armenian Sisters Academy instruct Western Armenian to the students , instead of Eastern Armenian , the official dialect of the Republic of Armenia .
The fate of Western Armenia â '' commonly referred to as `` The Armenian Question '' â '' is considered as a key issue in the modern history of the Armenian people . The first and second congresses of Western Armenians took place in Yerevan in 1917 and 1919 . Since 2000 , an organizing committee of congress of heirs of Western Armenians who survived the Armenian Genocide is active in diasporan communities .

Alexander von Humboldt -LRB- Berlin , 14 September 1769 â `` Berlin , 6 May 1859 -RRB- was a Prussian naturalist and explorer . Humboldt 's work on botanical geography was very important in the field of biogeography .
Humboldt was born in Berlin . His father , Alexander Georg von Humboldt , was a major in the Prussian Army . He married Maria Elizabeth von Colomb in 1766 . The couple had two sons , the younger was Alexander . Alexander 's elder brother was the Prussian minister , philosopher , and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt .
In his childhood Humboldt already liked to collect plants , shells , and insects . Humboldt 's father died very early -LRB- in 1799 -RRB- . From that time on his mother took care of his education .
Between 1799 and 1804 , Humboldt traveled to Latin America and was the first scientist who wrote about it . He was one of the first who said that South America and Africa was once one continent .
Late in his life he attempted to bring together different fields of science in his work Kosmos .

Michael Faraday -LRB- Newington Butts , Surrey , 22 September 1791 â `` Hampton Court , Surrey , 25 August 1867 -RRB- was an English chemist and physicist . He was a Fellow of the Royal Society , and was awarded the Royal , Copley and Rumford medals of the Society .
Although Faraday received little school education and did not know higher mathematics , he became one of the most influential scientists in history . Faraday was the greatest experimental physicist of the nineteenth century .
At the time when he lived , people like him were called natural philosophers . At that time only a little was known about electricity . Michael Faraday discovered many things about the way electricity flowing in a wire can act like a magnet -LRB- now called electromagnetism -RRB- . He also found out a lot about the way electricity can be used with chemicals to make them change -LRB- now called electrochemistry -RRB- .
He showed that magnetism is able to affect rays of light , as there is an underlying relationship between the two phenomena . His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the foundation of electric motor technology , and it was largely due to his efforts that electricity became viable for use in technology . He made the first electric motor . It is thanks to his early work that the electricity has been made into a useful thing today .
As a chemist , Michael Faraday discovered benzene , invented an early type of Bunsen burner , and popularized terminology such as anode , cathode , electrode , and ion . Faraday was the first Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution of Great Britain , a position to which he was appointed for life . He was also the Director of the Royal Institution after Sir Humphrey Davy .
Albert Einstein kept a photograph of Faraday on his study wall alongside pictures of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell .
Michael Faraday was born in Surrey , England . His family was poor . His father , James , was a blacksmith . James Faraday had come to London in the 1780s from North-West England . The young Michael Faraday was one of four children and only had the most basic school education . He had to teach himself to read and write . At fourteen he went to learn how to be a bookbinder and bookseller from a man called George Riebau .
During his seven-year study of making books with Riebau , he read many books . He read Isaac Watts 's The improvement of the mind . Faraday loved to use the ideas in this book in his work . He started to become interested in science , especially in electricity . He began to attend public lessons run by the best scientists in London at the time . He showed the notes he made to the great chemist Sir Humphrey Davy . Davy liked him and offered him a job as an assistant in March 1813 .
Faraday 's knowledge continued to grow as he helped Sir Humphrey Davy until he was making new discoveries on his own . He was eventually made a professor in 1833 . The importance of his work was seen within his own lifetime and the British government gave him a pension in his old age as a reward .
Faraday also discovered that if electricity strikes a metal object , it will only pass through the outside of the object . The inside is unaffected by the electricity . This is what keeps the people inside safe when lightning strikes a car or a plane . This is now called Faraday 's Cage .
Crash Bandicoot is a series of platform video games developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Sierra Entertainment . The Crash Bandicoot games were first made by the video game company Naughty Dog . Since then , the series has been given to many different companies before it was kept at Radical Entertainment . The games happen in the fictional Wumpa Islands in the south of Australia . There were 15 Crash Bandicoot games in 2007 , which have sold 40 million copies .
The main character in the Crash Bandicoot games , is also called Crash Bandicoot .
Crash Bandicoot was created by Naughty Dog in 1996 . It out in a platform game called Crash Bandicoot , where Crash has to save his girlfriend Tawna from the evil doctor Neo Cortex .
After Crash Bandicoot , Naughty Dog made a sequel -LRB- another videogame -RRB- , Crash Bandicoot 2 : Cortex Strikes Back , where Crash saves the world from Cortex for a second time .
In the third game of the series , Crash Bandicoot : Warped , Crash again defeats Cortex and his friend Uka Uka , who tries to conquer the world with the help of Nefarious Tropy and his time machine .
The fourth and last game made by Naughty Dog with Crash and company was Crash Team Racing , a racing game where Nitrous Oxide , an alien , challenged the Earth inhabitants to a cart race . After Naughty Dog , other companies made many more games in the Crash bandicoot series , and not only for Playstation .

The atoms of a chemical element can exist in different types . These are called isotopes . They have the same number of protons -LRB- and electrons -RRB- , but different numbers of neutrons . Different isotopes of the same element have different masses . Mass is the word for how much substance -LRB- or matter -RRB- something has . Things with different masses have different weights . Because different isotopes have different numbers of neutrons , they do not all weigh the same or have the same mass.
Different isotopes of the same element have the same atomic number . They have the same number of protons . The atomic number is decided by the number of protons . Isotopes have different mass numbers , though , because they have different numbers of neutrons .
The word isotope , meaning at the same place , comes from the fact that isotopes are located at the same place on the periodic table .
In a neutral atom , the number of electrons equals the number of protons . Isotopes of the same element also have the same number of electrons and the electronic structure . Because how an atom acts is decided by its electronic structure , isotopes are almost the same chemically , but different physically to their original atoms .
Heavier isotopes react slower than lighter isotopes of the same element . This `` mass effect '' is large for protium -LRB- 1H -RRB- and deuterium -LRB- 2H -RRB- , because deuterium has twice the mass of protium . For heavier elements , the relative mass difference between isotopes is much less , and the mass effect is usually small .
Atomic nuclei are protons and neutrons held together by the strong nuclear force . Because protons have a positive charge , they push against other protons . Neutrons are electrically neutral , and they attract the protons more than the protons push against other protons . This makes the nucleus more stable . So , we need neutrons for more than two protons to be in a nucleus . As there are more protons , more neutrons are needed to have a stable nucleus . But , if there are too many neutrons , the nucleus becomes unstable .
In Nature some elements have just a single isotopes . For example , fluorine 19F is the only isotope of fluorine . Other elements have many isotopes . For example , xenon has 9 isotopes .
Also , some isotopes are radioactive . These are called radioactive isotopes . Others are not radioactive . These are called stable isotopes .
Hydrogen has three common isotopes . The most common isotope of hydrogen is called protium -LRB- 1H -RRB- . A hydrogen atom with an extra neutron -LRB- atomic mass of 2 -RRB- is called deuterium -LRB- 2H -RRB- . Hydrogen with and two neutrons -LRB- atomic mass of 3 -RRB- is called tritium -LRB- 3H -RRB- . Protium and deuterium are stable isotopes , while tritium is a radioactive isotope -LRB- But is not radioactive on its own -RRB- .
The heaviest elements in the periodic table are all radioactive . All of the isotopes of radon , thorium , and uranium are radioactive , since they are very heavy . This is because the nuclear forces inside the nucleus of the atom have a tough time holding together all the particles with so many protons and neutrons inside .
Amphetamine is a sythetic drug . The drug is a stimulant : it can help people keep the focus and stay awake . It also decreases appetite and fatigue . Chemically , it is similar to Methamphetamine . These drugs increase the level of dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain , which can create euphoria . The class of drugs containing Amphetamine includes prescription drugs commonly used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder -LRB- ADHD -RRB- . It is also used to treat symptoms of traumatic brain injury -LRB- TBI -RRB- and the daytime drowsiness symptoms of narcolepsy , amongst others . Initially , amphetamine was more popularly used to reduce the appetite and to control weight .
Sometimes , the drug is used for fun or to boost performance . There are many different names that are used for amphetamines , a common one is speed . The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reports the typical retail price of amphetamine in Europe varied between â 3 and â 15 -LRB- $ 4 to $ 21.55 USD -RRB- a gram in half of the reporting countries . The name amphetamine is derived from its chemical name : alpha-methylphenethylamine .
The Flaviviridae are a family of viruses that are primarily spread through arthropod vectors -LRB- mainly ticks and mosquitoes -RRB- . The family gets its name from Yellow Fever virus , a type virus of Flaviviridae ; flavus means `` yellow '' in Latin .
Augusto Righi -LRB- 27 August 1850 â `` 8 June 1920 -RRB- was an Italian physicist that was a big part in the study of electromagnetism . He was born and died in Bologna .
In 1872 and 1880 in Bologna , he was researching mostly in electrostatics . He became an ordinary professor in physics at the University of Palermo in 1880 , when he was there he studied the transfer of heat and electricity in bismuth . From 1885 to 1889 he was a professor at the University of Padua -LRB- Padova -RRB- , studying the photoelectric effect . In late 1889 he went to the University of Bologna , where he worked for the rest of his life on things like the Zeeman Effect , ` Roentgen rays ' , and magnetism .

Torres Strait Islanders are the indigenous people of the Torres Strait Islands , part of Queensland , Australia . They are culturally related to the coastal peoples of Papua New Guinea . They are regarded as being distinct from other Aboriginal peoples of the rest of Australia . There are also two Torres Strait Islander communities on the nearby coast of the mainland .
There are 6,000 Torres Strait Islanders who live in the area of the Torres Strait , and 42,000 others who live outside of this area , mostly in the north of Queensland , particularly in Townsville and Cairns .
The indigenous people of the Torres Strait have a distinct culture which has slight variants on the different islands where they live . They are a sea-faring people , and engaged in trade with peoples of Papua New Guinea . The culture is complex , with some Australian elements , some Papuan elements , and some Austronesian elements , just like the languages . The Islanders seem to have been the dominant culture for many centuries , and neighbouring Aboriginal and Papuan cultures show some Island influence in religious ceremonies and the like . Archaeological , linguistic and folk history evidence suggests that the core of Island culture is Austronesian . Unlike the indigenous peoples of mainland Australia , the islanders were traditionally agriculturalists although they supplemented their food supplies through hunting and gathering .
Frame dragging is a theory which says that space is elastic , and particles in it will exchange energy with it . In the scientific world , `` elastic '' means that when you apply a certain amount of force to an object -LRB- which will cause it to bend -RRB- and then remove the force , the object will return to its original shape and energy state . Also , space is referred to as spacetime , which is simply a way to bring together the concepts of space and time together . This basically means that whenever space is affected , time is affected . Frame dragging would provide answers for very old questions about gravity , strong force , and wave-particle duality -LRB- how things like electrons can act like waves and particles at the same time -RRB- .
In frame dragging , particles spin , and this spin has energy in it . -LRB- It is important to note that this is not quantum physics spin , but an actual angular momentum spin ; the particles are actually spinning -RRB- . Since spacetime is elastic in this theory , it can absorb the energy -LRB- spin -RRB- of the particle . This would slow down the spin of the particle .
Mass has a strange effect that we experience in the normal world : it attracts other mass. . Scientists have been spending centuries trying to explain this occurrence . Recently , they have discovered that mass has an effect that it can curve spacetime . This means that when mass is present , the shortest path through spacetime between two points is slightly bent towards wherever the mass is .
Since the energy absorbed by spacetime has to go somewhere , many scientists predict that spacetime would be `` bunched up , '' or folded . This can also be phrased as a curvature -LRB- bend -RRB- in spacetime . This would indicate that the particle generated gravity . The reason that this theory is called `` frame dragging '' is probably due to the effect of particles effectively `` dragging '' or `` grabbing '' spacetime as they spin . Not only would space be curved , but time would as well .
However , the way to imagine this `` gravity '' is not so much as the force that we normally consider when we think of gravity , since normal gravity is created as well -LRB- due to its mass -RRB- . Basically , frame dragging is an effect that occurs when one object is moving near another , which makes both objects change their motion because of the other 's motion . Frame dragging does not occur if an object is neither spinning nor moving . In effect , one object `` deflects '' the motion of the other , and the other way around .
Scientists such as Einstein and SchrÃ dinger spent much of their lives trying to find an answer for how can something like an electron act like a wave and also act like a particle . Frame dragging states that since spacetime is elastic , it can also give the spin-energy back to the particle . Once the particle has all of its spin-energy given back to it , it acts most like a wave . At that point , it will once again begin using its energy bunching up spacetime . Once the particle is no longer spinning , it acts most like a particle . Then , spacetime begins giving the particle its energy back , and the cycle continues forever . This is how a particle can actually act like a particle and a wave at nearly the same time . No energy is lost during the cycle due to the conservation of energy .
Frame dragging also has an effect that if one particle is next to another , they can both save energy if one is absorbing energy as the other one is emitting it . -LRB- This can also increase the mass of both particles , using Einstein 's famous equation that energy is equal to a certain amount of mass -RRB- . This would encourage particles to group together , which would explain what strong force -LRB- a force that holds protons and neutrons in an atom nucleus together -RRB- is .
There are effects that come out of the math of the frame dragging theory . Scientists are currently testing one which is that if one small spinning object is orbiting a larger spinning object , the smaller object will slowly adjust its spin axis -LRB- the imaginary line which an object rotates around -RRB- to align with the larger object 's spin axis . This is known as the Lense-Thirring effect .

John Batman -LRB- 21 January 1801 â `` 5 May 1839 -RRB- was an Australian farmer and businessman who was one of the first white people to live in Melbourne .
Batman was born in Rosehill , Parramatta -LRB- part of Sydney -RRB- , and spent time in Tasmania -LRB- then called Van Diemen 's Land -RRB- . In Tasmania he started farming on land the government gave him . He brought more land . During this time , he was involved in conflicts with the Tasmanian Aborigines .
In December 1825 , or early 1826 , Batman captured the notorious bushranger -LRB- a kind of robber -RRB- , Matthew Brady .
Batman asked to be given land in the Westernport area of Victoria , but the government rejected him . So , in 1835 , as a leading member of the Port Phillip Association he sailed for the mainland of Australia in the schooner Rebecca and explored much of Port Phillip Bay . Batman made an agreement , now known as Batman 's Treaty , with some local Aborigines to rent their land in return for things like knives and flour every year . Probably the Wurundjeri people did not understand the agreement . In any case , the Governor of New South Wales said the agreement was not legal the land was owned by the Government rather than the Aborigines .
Batman became very unhealthy after 1835 , and he separated from his wife , convict Elizabeth Callaghan . They had had seven daughters and a son . His son drowned in the Yarra River . In his last months the local Aborigines looked after him .
Batman is remembered by some statues around Melbourne , and is buried in the Fawkner Cemetery , a cemetery named after his fellow colonist John Pascoe Fawkner . There is also a memorial in the Old Melbourne Cemetery .
Melbourne was called Batmania for a very brief time , in 1835 , after John Batman .

A moth is an insect closely related to the butterfly . Most species of moth are only active at night . They can be told apart from butterflies in several ways . Moth antenna look like little feathers , and their wings are held flat on their backs when they are not flying .
Moths , specifically their caterpillars , are a major farm pest in many parts of the world . Caterpillars eat the plants that farmers grow and sometimes kill them . The caterpillar of the gypsy moth -LRB- Lymantria dispar -RRB- causes great harm to forests in the northeast United States . In warm climates , the diamondback moth -LRB- Plutella xylostella -RRB- is perhaps the most serious pest of cabbage crops .
Several different kinds of moths are commonly regarded as pests because their larvae eat fabric such as clothes and blankets made from natural fibers such as wool or silk . They are less likely to eat fabric containing artificial fibers . There are some reports that they can be repelled by the scent of wood from juniper and cedar trees , by lavender , or by other natural oils . However , many consider this unlikely to prevent moths from living somewhere . Chemicals are the most effective way to keep moths away , however , there are concerns about the chemicals being dangerous to people . Moth larvae are not killed by freezing the items they live in .
Moths are difficult to kill and usually not killed by poisons that work on mosquitoes and flies .
Some moths are farmed . The most important of these is the silkworm . It is farmed for the silk with which it builds its cocoon . The silk industry produces over 130 million kilograms of raw silk , worth about 250 million U.S. dollars , each year .
Moths will fly around bright objects , and appear to be attracted to light . Most scientists think that this is because moths use the light of the moon to help them fly in a straight line . The light from lamps confuses the moths .
Night-blooming flowers usually depend on moths -LRB- or bats -RRB- to pollinate them , and artificial lighting can draw moths away from the flowers , hurting the plant 's ability to reproduce .
Moths usually pollinate night-blooming flowers because they are nocturnal -LRB- they sleep during the day and come out at night -RRB- . A moth uses its proboscis to collect nectar just like a butterfly does . However , moths do not always land on the flower to get the nectar : they often hover near the flower and flap their wings hard while they sip the nectar . Because of this , moth-pollinated flowers do not need a landing pad . In fact , some moth-pollinated flowers point downward , like the yucca flowers -LRB- see picture on the left -RRB- .

Their semi-major axes -LRB- distances from Jupiter -RRB- range between 22,800,000 and 24,100,000 km -LRB- the same range as the Carme group -RRB- , their inclinations between 144.5 Â and 158.3 Â , and their eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.43 .
The International Astronomical Union -LRB- IAU -RRB- reserves names ending in - e for all retrograde moons , including this group 's members .
The PasiphaÃ `` group is believed to have been formed when Jupiter captured an asteroid which broke up after a collision . The original asteroid was not disturbed heavily : the original body is calculated to have been 60 km in diameter , about the same size as PasiphaÃ `` ; PasiphaÃ `` has 99 % of the original body 's mass. .

Cardamom is used for two herbs related to ginger . Their seeds are used as a spice . The two species are named Elettaria and Amomum , respectively . The seeds grow in a small seedpod . This seedpod is triangular in cross-section and has the shape of a spindle . There is a thin papery outer shell and small black seeds . Elettaria pods are light green in color , Amomum pods are larger and dark brown .

A patent is an official letter that anyone can read . The letter is printed by a government . The letter describes an invention . The owner of the letter has the right to stop anyone from copying the invention . The letter is first owned by the inventor . The inventor can sell the letter to another person or a company .
The government reads the letter to make sure that the invention is new . If the invention is not new , then the inventor will not get the patent . The invention also has to be hard to make . If the invention is too easy to make , the inventor will not get the patent .
An inventor can sue someone to stop them from copying the invention . The person or company that copies the invention will have to pay the inventor money . They must also stop copying . They are not sent to jail .
The letter only lasts for 20 years . After that , anyone can copy the invention .
Each country has its own patents . China gives Chinese patents . India gives Indian patents . The United States gives United States patents . An inventor can get a patent in any country the inventor wants . An inventor can get patents in many different countries for the same invention . Each patent in each country costs money .
The rules for patents are similar for most countries .
To get a patent , the inventor must ask the government by describing the invention in writing . This is called a patent application . The inventor can write the patent application , but it is usually written by a person trained to write patent applications . This person is called a patent agent or , if the person is a lawyer , a patent attorney .
The government does not usually just give the inventor a patent . Instead , the government tries to confirm whether the idea is actually new . This is called patent examination . The government will try to find books , stories , or even other patents that show that the idea was not new . The inventor , or his or her patent attorney , then try to show how the inventor 's idea is different from anything that the government finds .
If the government finds that the inventor 's idea is new and useful , it will publish the patent . The government will also send the inventor a copy of his or her patent application with a special seal . This copy is the patent .
The inventor must also pay the government a tax to get a patent . Usually , an inventor pays money to ask for the patent , and the inventor pays money when he or she gets a patent . In some countries , the owner of a patent must also pay money to keep the patent .
The owner of a patent can stop other people from using their idea . If someone other than the patent owner uses the patent , this is called infringing a patent . If the owner knows that someone is infringing his or her patent , the patent owner can ask a court to stop them . If the court agrees that the other person was using the patent , the court can make that person pay a fine to the patent owner .
The patent owner can give other people permission to use their patent . This is called a license . The person that wants to use another person 's patent will usually pay money to the patent owner .
Patents most often cover products or processes that contain â newâ functional or technical ideas . They are concerned with how things work , how they are made or what they are made of . Patents cover many different things such as electronics , medicines , agriculture and transport â `` anything in fact from a small detail in an electric switch to an entire power station .
Often a product is marked with a text saying ` patent pendingâ or ` pat . pending ' , which means that a patent has been asked for -LRB- part of -RRB- the product . Then people are warned that they should not copy the invention .
Patents are usually very long . They include a number of smaller parts . A patent usually includes a section that briefly describes the idea called the abstract . It also may include a section that describes other people 's inventions and how the inventor 's idea is different called the `` background of the invention . ''
The patent also includes a long description of the idea itself called a `` detailed description . '' In this section , the inventor tries to describe every detail of his or her invention .
The patent also has a number of pictures called the `` figures . '' The figures are usually drawn by people called draftsman that are trained to draw in a special way . The pictures are labeled with numbers to show different parts of the invention .
At the end of most patents is a section called the claims . These are usually numbered . They include the a short statement that lists all of the things needed for the invention . A court will use the claims to decide if another person is `` infringing the patent . ''

Steel is a mixture of several metals -LRB- this is called an alloy -RRB- but most of it is iron . Steel is harder and stronger than iron . Steels are often iron alloys with between 0.02 % and 1.7 % percent carbon by weight ; alloys with higher carbon than this are known as cast iron . Steel is different from wrought iron , that has little or no carbon . There are some newer steels in which carbon is replaced with other alloying materials .
Steel has a long history . People in India and Sri Lanka were making steel by hand more than 1,500 years ago . It was very expensive and was often used to make swords and knives . In the Middle Ages , steel could be made only in small amounts since the processes were slow and took a long time .
In the time since , there have been many changes to the way steel is made . In about the year 1610 steel started to be made in England , and the way it was made got better and cheaper over the next 100 years . Cheap steel was a help in the start of the Industrial Revolution in England and in Europe . The first industrial process for making cheap steel was Bessemer process , followed by Siemens-Martin open-hearth process . Today the most common way of making steel is the basic oxygen steelmaking . It uses a large turnip-shaped vessel called converter . Liquid raw iron called `` pig iron '' is poured in and some scrap metal is added in to balance the heat . Oxygen is then blown in the iron . It will burn off any remaining carbon and other impurities . Then enough carbon is added in the batch to make the carbon contents as wanted . The liquid steel is then tapped off . It can be either cast into molds or rolled into sheets , slabs , beams and other so-called `` long products '' , such as railway tracks .
Today steel is made in huge buildings called steel mills , and is most often made by machines . It is a very cheap metal today and is used to make many things . Steel is used to making buildings and bridges , and all kinds of machines . Almost all ships and cars are today made from steel . When a steel object is no more usable , or it is broken beyond repair , it is called scrap . The scrap can be melted down and re-shaped into new object . Steel is recyclable material ; that is , the same steel can be used and re-used .
Steel is a metal alloy which includes iron and often some carbon .
Every material is made up of atoms which are very small parts . Some atoms hold together quite well , which is what makes some solid materials hard . Something made of pure iron is softer than steel because the atoms can slip over one another . If other atoms like carbon are added , they are different from iron atoms and stop the iron atoms from sliding apart so easily . This makes the metal stronger and harder .
Changing the amount of carbon -LRB- or other atoms -RRB- added to steel will change those things that are interesting and useful about the metal . These are called the properties of the steel . Some properties are :
Steel with more carbon is harder and stronger than pure iron , but it also breaks more easily -LRB- brittle -RRB- .
There are a huge number of things that people make from steel . It is one of the most common and useful metals . A lot of items made from iron in the past are now made of steel . Some of them are :

Veal is the meat of young cattle -LRB- calves -RRB- , as opposed to beef from older cattle . Though veal can be made from a calf of either sex and any breed , most veal comes from male calves of dairy cattle breeds . Veal has a tender texture .
Veal has been an important ingredient in Italian and French cuisine since ancient times . The veal is often in the form of cutlets , such as the Italian cotoletta or the famous Austrian dish Wiener Schnitzel . Some classic French veal dishes include : fried escalopes , fried veal grenadines -LRB- small thick fillet steaks -RRB- , stuffed paupiettes , roast joints and blanquettes . As veal is lower in fat than many meats , care must be taken in preparation to ensure that it does not become tough . Veal is often coated in preparation for frying or eaten with a sauce . Veal Parmigiana is a common Italian-American dish consisting of breaded veal cutlets .
Veal is a controversial issue in terms of animal welfare .
Many animal welfare groups , who strongly focus on factory farming , try to educate consumers about several veal production procedures that they consider to be inhumane . This education has been successful in creating pressure on the industry , resulting in recently announced changes in the methods used by the veal industry .
A strong animal welfare movement about veal started in the 1980s with the release of photographs of veal calves tied up in crates where they could barely move . After people saw these photographs , people started buying less veal . They have not started buying more again .
Many veal farmers listened to the concern of their customers and have started improving conditions in their veal farms .
The American Veal Association has announced they plan to stop the use of crates by 2017 , which is often the main focus of controversy in veal farming . Strauss Brands is the first veal packer in the US to raise veal calves completely tether free and group raised since December 31 , 2008 .
Though a lot of people think the crates are bad because the calves ca n't move much and get sick , the Veal Quality Assurance Program & Veal Issues Management Program industry fact sheet , and the Ontario Veal Association say the crates are important for keeping out diseases and keeping the calves from getting hurt . They also state that it lets veal farmers provide more personal attention to veal calves .
Other uses for male dairy calves include raising bob veal -LRB- slaughter at 2 or 3 days old -RRB- , raising calves as `` red veal '' without the harsh food restrictions needed to create pale meat -LRB- resulting in fewer antibiotic treatments and fewer slaughtered calves -RRB- , and as dairy beef .
When it comes to the centuries-old method of free raised veal , calves never experience the stress of confinement , separation from their mothers and herd-mates , or an unnatural diet . Many veal producers are realizing this , and the demand for free raised veal is rapidly increasing .
In 2007 , less than 5 % of veal calves were raised in a group environment . In 2009 , this had increased to 35 % .
Veal crates became illegal in the UK in 1990 , and a full ban has been placed for the entire European Union , as of 2007 . Switzerland , with its substantial dairy industry , continues to use crates .
Veal calf production as such is not allowed in many Northern European countries , such as in Finland . In Finland it is illegal to give an animal food the caretaker knows is bad for it , and it is also illegal to not give the animal enough food .
Crates are slowly being banned in the United States . As stated above , several large veal producers are working on getting rid of veal crates , as well as the American Veal Association .

Therocephalians -LRB- ` beast-heads ' -RRB- are an extinct group of Theriodonts , of infraorder or family status .
They lived from the middle Permian into the Triassic 265.0 â '' 245.0 million years ago , so existing for about 20 million years .
The therocephalians are named after their large skulls , which , along with the structure of their teeth , suggest that they were successful carnivores .
Like other non-mammalian therapsids , therocephalians are sometimes described as mammal-like reptiles . In fact Therocephalia is the group most closely related to the cynodonts , which gave rise to the mammals .
This relationship shows in a variety of anatomical features , possibly including whiskers and hair . There remain many unanswered questions about the phylogeny , anatomy , and physiology of therocephalians .
The fossils of therocephalians are numerous in the Karoo of South Africa , but have also been found in Russia , China , and Antarctica .
Early therocephalian fossils discovered in Middle Permian deposits of South Africa support a Gondwanan origin for the group , which seems to have spread quickly throughout the world . Although almost every therocephalian lineage ended during the great Permianâ `` Triassic extinction event , a few representatives of the subgroup -LRB- called Eutherocephalia -RRB- survived into the early Triassic and continued to diversify .
However , the last therocephalians became extinct by the early middle Triassic . The reasons are not known .

In music a glissando is a slide up or down the notes of a scale . The plural is â glissandiâ . In written music the instruction to the player is often shortened to â glissâ . The word comes from the French â glisserâ = â to slideâ .
With the singing voice , or with an instrument such as the trombone or a string instrument a glissando is a smooth slide in which the pitch gradually changes , becoming higher and higher . The trombonist can make a glissando by blowing whilst pushing out or pulling in the slide . The violinist can make a glissando by sliding a finger up or down the fingerboard .
With instruments such as the piano , xylophone or harp a glissando is a quick slide in which we hear one note after another because the pitches between the notes can not be played . On the piano there are two ways to play a glissando : either on the white notes or on the black notes . At the end of the piano piece called Ondine from Gaspard de la Nuit by Maurice Ravel both these types of glissando can be heard . The pianist has to play a glissando with tips of the fingers or the finger nails . It can be quite painful to practice them a lot . Harpists are very fond of playing glissandi . By changing the position of the harp pedals a harpist can change the scale which will sound when the glissando is played .
Many modern timpani have pedals which tighten or slacken the drum head . These can be used to make a glissando . The Hungarian composer BÃ la BartÃ k often used this effect .
Some jazz clarinettists manage to play a glissando on the clarinet . They do this by gradually changing the way they blow whilst at the same time gradually lifting all the fingers off the keys . George Gershwin 's Rhapsody in Blue starts with a glissando on the solo clarinet .
When composers write a glissando they write the first and the last note , and then put a long , straight line between the notes , and write the word â glissandoâ or â glissâ .
Franklin Pierce was born on November 23 , 1804 , in Hillsborough , New Hampshire . He attended school at Hillsborough Center but then moved to Hancock Academy in Hancock at the age of 11 . After attending school there for five years , he was transferred to Francetown in the spring of 1820 . After he entered , he felt homesick and returned home . Consequently , his father then put him in a wagon , drove him half way back to school , and left him on the roadside without saying a word . Franklin walked the seven remaining miles back to school . Later that year , he was transferred to Phillips Exeter Academy to prepare for college . That fall , he was sent to Bowdoin College in Brunswick , Maine . While he was there , Franklin Pierce participated in literary , political , and debating clubs . During his second year there , his grades were the lowest in his class , but he was able to improve them and graduated with the rank of third best in his class .
Once finished with college , he went to law school in Northampton , Massachusetts . Pierce was admitted to the bar and began law practice in Concord , New Hampshire , in 1827 . Franklin Pierce rose to a central position in the Democratic party of New Hampshire and was elected to the lower house in New Hampshireâ s General Court in 1828 . Pierce served in the State House from 1829 to 1833 and also served as Speaker from 1832 to 1833 . Then in 1832 , Franklin was elected Democrat to the 23rd and 24th of Congress from March 4 , 1833 , to March 4 , 1837 . At 27 years of age , Pierce was the youngest U.S. Representative at that time . In 1836 , he was elected by the New Hampshire General Court as a Democrat to the U.S Senate , serving from March 4 , 1837 , to February 28 , 1842 . After serving in the Senate , Pierce went back to Concord to resume law practice . He then was U.S. Attorney from 1845 to 1847 for the district of New Hampshire , though he declined Democratic nomination for Governor of New Hampshire and refused the appointment as General of the United States .
On November 19 , 1834 , Franklin Pierce married Jane Means Appleton . They had three children , all of which died in childhood . Franklin Pierce Jr. died only three days after birth ; and Frank Robert Pierce died at four years of age from epidemic typhus ; just two months before his inauguration , Franklin Pierce and his family boarded a train bound for Boston . Shortly after , their derailed car started to roll down an embankment . Franklin and Jane survived , merely shaken up , but saw their 11 year old son Benjamin get crushed to death . Jane Pierce thought the train accident was a divine punishment for Franklinâ s pursuit and acceptance of high office .
Franklin Pierce served as President from March 4 , 1853 , to March 4 , 1857 . He was the first President to â affirmâ his oath of office instead of swearing it -LRB- the only other president to do this has been Herbert Hoover -RRB- . So rather then placing his hands on the Bible , Franklin Pierce placed his hands on a law book . He was also the first President to recite his inaugural address from memory . Surprisingly , Franklin Pierce selected men of different opinions for his Cabinet . Many people expected a diverse group to break up quickly , but the Cabinet stayed together for Pierceâ s four-year term .
Franklin Pierceâ s toughest challenge as President was the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 . This act repealed the Missouri Compromise and , in the west , reopened the question of slavery . These and more triggered a series of events known as `` Bleeding Kansas '' . Pro-slavery Border Ruffians , mostly from Missouri , illegally voted in a government . Pierce recognized this and called the Topeka Constitution , set up by Free-Staters , as an act of â rebellion . â Overall , Franklin Pierce is ranked among the least effective Presidents of the United States , as he was unable to steer a steady , prudent course .
After losing the Democratic reelection in 1856 , Pierce retired with his wife . Franklin Pierce died in Concord , New Hampshire on October 8th , 1869 , 4:49 am , at the age of 64 . He was buried in Old North Cemetery in Concord .

Ludic Check -LRB- May 22 , 1917 -- May 11 , 2009 -RRB- was a professional hockey player who played for the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Black Hawks in the National Hockey League . After several years of hockey in Manitoba , Saskatchewan and New York , Check was signed by the Montreal Canadiens after a season playing with the Quebec Senior Hockey League in 1943 . In his first NHL season , he played only one professional game , with the Red Wings in 1944 .
Check was then loaned to the Blackhawks , where he played 26 games in his final NHL season . The Canadiens then renewed his contract and sent him to the Ottawa `` Senior '' Senators of the Quebec Senior Hockey League , where he spent the last six seasons of his career . Check was a part of two Allan Cup-winning teams , in 1944 and 1949 , and became a sales representative in later life . He died on May 11 , 2009 in Ottawa , Ontario at the age of 91 .
Check was born in Brandon , Manitoba on May 22 , 1917 . Alongside Frank Stahan , Check played two seasons from 1936 through 1938 with the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League .

For the 1944-1945 season , he was loaned to the Chicago Black Hawks , playing 26 games and scoring six goals and two assists .
Check spent the rest of his career with the Ottawa `` Senior '' Senators of the QSHL , after having his contract re-purchased by the Canadiens and being loaned out . He competed in the Allan Cup twice more . In 1948 his team lost to the Edmonton Eskimos , but captured the championship in 1949 after facing off against the Regina Pats .

`` Sunday school '' is the name for many different kinds of religious education done on Sundays .
The first Sunday school may have been that opened in 1751 in St. Mary 's Church , Nottingham . Another early start was made by Hannah Ball , a native of High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire , England , who founded a school within the town in 1769 . However , many people think that Robert Raikes began Sunday school . Robert Raikes was the editor of The Glouchestor Journal , and he wanted to stop children from becoming bad . In 1805 , Stockport Sunday School made a school for 5000 students . In the late 19th century this was the largest in the world . The first Sunday school in London opened at Surrey Chapel by a pastor named Rowland Hill . By 1831 , 1,250,000 children went every week to Sunday School in Great Britain . This was bout 25 percent of the people .
The American Sunday School system was first begun by Samuel Slater in Pawtucket , Rhode Island , in the 1790 's .
Some Roman Catholic churches do Sunday schools , though Catholics commonly refer to Sunday school as `` Catechism class '' .
Priests or pastors sometimes teach Sunday schools .

Australopithecus anamensis is a fossil species of Australopithecus . The first fossilized specimen of the species , though not recognized as such at the time , was a single arm bone found in Pliocene strata in the Kanapoi region of East Lake Turkana by a Harvard University research team in 1965 . The specimen was tentatively assigned at the time to Australopithecus and dated about four million years old . Little additional information was uncovered until 1987 , when Canadian archaeologist Allan Morton -LRB- with Harvard University 's Koobi Fora Field School -RRB- discovered fragments of a specimen protruding from a partially eroded hillside east of Allia Bay , near Lake Turkana , Kenya . Six years later the London-born Kenyan paleoanthropologist Meave Leakey and archaeologist Alan Walker excavated the Allia Bay site and uncovered several additional fragments of the hominid , including one complete lower jaw bone which closely resembles that of a common chimpanzee -LRB- Pan troglodytes -RRB- but whose teeth are much more similar to those of a human . In 1995 , Meave Leakey and her associates , taking note of differences between Australopithecus afarensis and the new finds , assigned them to a new species , A. anamensis , deriving its name from the Turkana word anam , meaning `` lake '' .

The Class 168 Clubman is a diesel multiple-unit -LRB- DMU -RRB- train used by Chiltern Railways for InterCity services between London and the Midlands . They were built in several batches from 1997 onwards . The first batch of units was classified 168\/0 under TOPS and bore a large resemblance , both visually and in terms of electrical design , to the Class 165 units previously built by BREL at York . This is because they were based on plans originally drawn up by Network SouthEast and thus can be considered to be Networker Turbos . Subsequent builds , classified 168\/1 and 168\/2 , were given the newer style cab and a new design of wiring and thus are part of the Turbostar family of trains .

Wall-E is an animated movie that was created by Pixar and Disney . It was released on June 27 , 2008 .
In the far future , Earth has been covered with trash . Humans have decided to leave in a huge ship and will return when the planet is better . They have built hundreds of robots called WALL-E to make the trash into blocks and put it away to try to clean up the planet . One WALL-E is the last one that is still working , and spends his days cleaning trash up and putting away little things that he likes to play around with , like tapes , lights , and Rubik 's cubes .
One day , a rocket lands on Earth . Another robot called EVE comes out . She is looking for signs of life . WALL-E attempts to become romantic with her by following her around . She does not seem to like WALL-E much at first , but later changes her mind . He invites her into his home , where he shows her a movie where people are dancing . When WALL-E shows her a plant that he found , she takes it and suddenly she and can not move . She does not respond to WALL-E . WALL-E protects her body from storms . He even takes her out on a date . After a couple of days , the same rocket comes down and another robot picks EVE up . WALL-E catches the outside of the ship and is blasted into space . The rocket then docks with the huge ship , the Axiom .
The viewer then gets a look at how life has changed on the ship . All people sit in chairs and are very fat because they do not exercise and due to how a lack of gravity destroys their muscles . Robots do most of the work . EVE is sent to the Captain 's pad . If plant life is found , the ship will turn back to Earth . However , by the time she arrives in the captain 's area , the plant is gone .
She and WALL-E -LRB- who has followed her -RRB- are then sent to another area to be repaired . During the repair , WALL-E thinks the robots are hurting EVE , so he breaks out and destroys the security system . As a result , all the robots cause trouble . EVE is mad at WALL-E and tries to send him away on a rocket . But then they see the bad robot who took the plant . The bad robot puts the plant in the rocket and sets it to explode . WALL-E is on the rocket when it launches . EVE chases after him . WALL-E escapes the rocket one second before it explodes . He also saved the plant . EVE is so happy that she gives WALL-E a kiss . The kiss makes an electric spark . They dance with each other outside in space ; EVE can fly , and WALL-E uses a fire extinguisher he took from the rocket to get around .
The two of them go back to the Captain 's area . The Captain watches videos EVE took of Earth . These videos also show WALL-E protecting EVE and taking her out on a date . EVE falls in love with WALL-E by watching this . The Captain wants to go back to Earth to fix the planet . However , the main robot , called Auto , says they can not go home . When the Captain asks why , Auto shows a video where the president said that Earth was not fit for humans forever and to keep piloting the ship forever around space . The captain refuses . The bad robot who took the plant takes the plant again . He throws it down a garbage shaft , but WALL-E catches it . Auto shocks WALL-E and sends him down the shaft . Auto then turns EVE off and throws her down the shaft . Auto locks the Captain in his room .
EVE turns on in a big room where the ship 's garbage is sent into space . She finds WALL-E and finds he is badly hurt . WALL-E tells EVE that he has parts that can fix him on Earth . WALL-E and EVE try to get the ship to go back to Earth . But Auto hurts WALL-E even more . The Captain stands up and turns off Auto . The ship returns to Earth . EVE fixes WALL-E , but he does not remember who EVE is . EVE is sad and thinks WALL-E is gone forever . She gives him another kiss . The kiss makes another spark . The spark makes WALL-E remember EVE . WALL-E and EVE are happy . The humans step out of the ship on Earth and begin fixing the planet .

A Pacific hurricane , then , is a tropical cyclone in the northern Pacific Ocean east of the Date Line . Tropical cyclones that form in the western north Pacific are called typhoons . This separation between the two basins is convenient , however , as tropical cyclones rarely form in the central north Pacific and few ever cross the dateline .

A doughnut -LRB- spelled donut in American English -RRB- is a sweet deep-fried piece of dough or batter .
Ring doughnuts are made by joining the ends of a long , thin piece of dough into a ring or by using a doughnut cutter , which perfectly cuts the outside and inside shape , leaving a doughnut-shaped piece of dough and a doughnut hole from dough removed from the center . This smaller piece of dough can be cooked or re-added to the batch to make more doughnuts . A disk-shaped doughnut can also be stretched and molded into a torus until the center breaks to form a hole . Or , a doughnut depositor can be used to place a circle of liquid dough -LRB- batter -RRB- into the deep fryer . Doughnuts can be made from a yeast-based dough for more puffy doughnuts or a special type of cake batter . Yeast-raised doughnuts contain about 25 % oil by weight , whereas cake doughnuts ' oil content is around 20 % , but they have extra fat in the batter before frying . Cake doughnuts are fried for about 90 seconds at about 190 Â C to 198 Â C , turning once . Yeast-raised doughnuts absorb more oil because they take longer to fry , about 150 seconds , at 182 Â C to 190 Â C. Cake doughnuts normally weigh between 24 g and 28 g , whereas yeast-raised doughnuts normally are 38 g and are mostly larger when finished .
The two most common types of doughnut are ring doughnuts , which are shaped like rings , and filled doughnuts , which are round and have jam , jelly , custard , whipped cream , or chocolate inside them . Most doughnuts have an icing -LRB- also called a `` frosting '' -RRB- made with icing sugar , water , and flavourings -LRB- such as chocolate -RRB- . Some doughnuts are rolled in sweet foods such as sugar or shredded coconut .
Doughnuts are often eaten in the morning , along with a cup of hot coffee . Doughnuts can be purchased from doughnut shops or from grocery stores . People also eat doughnuts as a dessert , or as a snack .
Doughnuts can cause health problems if they are eaten too often . One of these problems is that doughnuts contain a large amount of fat . Eating too much fat can lead to clogged arteries . When the arteries get clogged , blood does not go through them easily . Also , doughnuts contain a large amount of sugar and white flour , which are turned into fat when they come inside our body . Doughnuts are a health worry in Canada where each person eats more doughnuts per year than any other country .

The epididymis is the part of the human male reproductive system . It is the tube that holds the testicles in place . It stretches from the back of each testicle to the van deferens .
Sperm made in the testis go into the head -LRB- caput -RRB- of the epididymis , go through the body -LRB- corpus -RRB- and stop at the tail -LRB- cauda -RRB- , where they are stored . When sperm are first made and travel to the head , they are not yet ready to be ejaculated . They can not swim or fertilize an egg . By the time they reach the tail , the sperm can fertilize an egg . The sperm are transferred to the Seminal visicle through the vas deferens . The sperm can not swim yet , so muscle contractions push the sperm to the seminal vesicle where final development is finished . .
When the sperm are ejaculated , they move through the tail of the epididymis . There are so many sperm that they can not swim , but use peristalsis from muscles in the vas deferens .
An injury or infection of the epididymis causes epididymitis , a painful condition that can take months to heal . Sometimes the testicle has to be removed . There does not seem to be any single cause , or treatment for this condition . Some doctors treat it with antibiotics , some take a `` wait and see '' attitude . At times just one testicle is affected and at others , both .

Jesus -LRB- probably born between 7 and 4 , killed between 30 and 34 in Jerusalem -RRB- was the man whose life and teachings started the Christian religion . Most historians agree that he was a Jew from a town called Nazareth in Galilee , in the country that is today called Israel . He was thought of as a teacher and a healer . He was baptized by John the Baptist . He was crucified in Jerusalem on the orders of Pontius Pilate .
The name Jesus came from the Aramaic name `` Yeshua '' , from Hebrew Yah-shua , meaning `` God saves '' which was a popular name of the time . Jesus is often called `` Jesus Christ '' or `` Christ '' . The word Christ comes from the Greek word christos and means `` the one marked on the head with oil '' or `` the anointed one '' . In Jesus ' country , anointing was done to show that a person was chosen to be a king or a leader . Jesus is also called `` Messiah '' , which comes from the Hebrew term Moshiach , and also means `` the anointed one '' .
Stories about the life of Jesus have been recorded by different writers . The best known are four books called the Gospels . They form the beginning of the New Testament , a part of the Bible . Gospel means `` Good News '' . The Gospels are claimed to be written by followers of Jesus . They tell a little about his birth , and mostly about his adult life : his teachings , ministry , death , and a reported resurrection -LRB- return from death -RRB- . There are four Gospels : the Gospel of Mark , the Gospel of Matthew , the Gospel of Luke , and the Gospel of John .
Several Jewish and Roman historians , such as Flavius Josephus , Tacitus , Pliny the Younger , and Suetonius -LRB- all born after Jesus was crucified -RRB- , mention Jesus in their writings . They usually only mention his execution or problems between the Roman government and his followers ; they do not talk about his life .
Most Christians remember the day that Jesus was born as the holiday of Christmas . Although the Gospels do not say what day Jesus was born , early Christians living in Rome chose 25th December because there was already a Roman holiday on that day . They also celebrate the time that the Gospels say he died and was raised from the dead as the holiday of Easter .
This section is about the birth , ministry and death of Jesus . It is taken from the four books of the Bible , called the Gospels of Matthew , Mark , Luke and John . They were written in the 1st century CE . Nearly all other writing about Jesus is based on these four books .
The Gospels of Matthew and Luke say that before the birth of Jesus , both Mary his mother , and the man that she was promised to , Joseph , knew that Jesus was going to be the Messiah or King that had been promised to the Jewish people , in the ancient Jewish books .
Luke 's Gospel tells most of the story . At the time that Jesus was born , the Roman Empire ruled most of Europe , England , the Middle East and North Africa . The Government wanted every single family to have their name taken down to be taxed , so everyone had to go back to the place where they came from . Joseph came from the small town of Bethlehem , near Jerusalem , so even though Mary was close to giving birth to her baby , they had to travel , with thousands of other people .
When they got to Bethlehem , every room was full . There was nowhere for them to stay except in a stable , an animal shed . The baby Jesus was born in the stable , was wrapped up , and put to sleep on the straw in the feed bin -LRB- the manger -RRB- . Luke tells us that the shepherds who were minding the sheep on the hillside came in to see the baby , and went away singing thanks to God for the newborn king .
In the Gospel of Matthew it says that wise men from another country saw a new star in the sky and came to find the young Jesus because they knew that the Messiah was going to be born under a star , and that the star was a sign that Jesus was born to be a king .
The arrival of Jesus was prophesied by John the Baptist . He baptized Jesus in the Jordan River . During the baptism , the Spirit of God , like a dove , came down upon Jesus , and the voice of God was heard . According to the Bible , the Spirit led Jesus into the desert where he fasted for 40 days . There , he resisted the Devil 's temptations . Then Jesus went into Galilee , settled in Capernaum , and began to preach about the Kingdom of God . He was about 30 years old .
Jesus taught mainly by telling stories . He taught that God alone was the true king , and that people should love God and love each other as the Hebrew Bible told them to do . Jesus performed miracles that were signs of God 's power , such as giving hungry people food and wine , healing sick people , and making dead people alive again . He also set people free from evil spirits .
Jesus gathered together twelve men , known as the Twelve Apostles , whom he chose and trained to spread his message . He had many other disciples , including many women , but because of Jewish customs , the women disciples could not travel to distant places on their own as teachers .
The Bible says Jesus became famous . He went to Jerusalem , where many people were visiting the city for a Holy Day . When they heard that he was coming , they greeted him as if he was a king . They thought perhaps he would free them from the Roman rule , but Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey , as a sign that he came in peace .
Jesus did a lot of things that upset the Jewish religious leaders . He often showed disrespect for customs that the Jews had kept for many centuries . For example , Jews did no work at all on the 7th day of the week , the Sabbath , because it was a holy day , but Jesus often showed disrespect for this custom . In John 's Gospel , chapter 5 , there is the story of Jesus healing a crippled man . Jesus saw a man lying on a mattress . He healed the man , and told him to pick up the mattress and go home . Carrying the mattress on the Sabbath was against religious custom , so the religious leaders argued with Jesus about it . They then watched everything he did , and remembered all the things that were against the religious customs .
In Mark 's Gospel , chapter 11 , it says that when Jesus arrived in Jerusalem , he went to the Jewish Temple . He became angry at what he saw . There were people selling things there , and money lenders who were cheating poor people . Jesus chased away all the people who were selling things . He said the chief priests and scribes had turned the temple into a den of thieves because they were making money from the poor and taking away homes from poor women who had no other way to pay for the temple worship .
The Gospels say that the temple leaders were angry and wanted to kill him . They told the Roman Government that Jesus wanted to become the king of the country and take it over . The gospels say the Roman Governor thought that Jesus should be set free , but that the Jewish leaders said , `` If you do that , then you are not the friend of Caesar ! '' -LRB- Caesar was the Roman ruler . -RRB-
The Governor sentenced him to death for claiming to be the king of the Jews . The Roman soldiers killed Jesus by crucifixion ; they nailed his hands and feet to a cross . This was a common way for the Romans to kill rebels and criminals .
Jesus ' body was buried in a tomb which belonged to one of his followers . He was placed there in a hurry , because the Sabbath day , when no one could work , started when the sun went down . On the day after the Sabbath , early in the morning , women came to wash the body and treat it with spice and perfumed oil . But the Gospels say that the body of Jesus was gone , and that he was seen alive afterwards . -LRB- This is called the Resurrection . -RRB-
Some people , like the disciple Thomas , said `` I 'm not going to believe this , until I have seen it with my own eyes ! '' But the Bible says that more than 500 people , including Thomas , saw Jesus alive again . There are many stories in the Gospels about what Jesus did once he was resurrected . Finally , Luke 's Gospel says that Jesus took his disciples to a hill , where he blessed them and told them to spread his teaching through all the world , and that then clouds came down , and he was lifted up to Heaven .
The Christian Church is founded on Jesus . The things that Christians believe about Jesus are based on the four Gospels of the Bible , and on letters or `` Epistles '' that were written in the 1st century , explaining Jesus ' teachings to his followers .
Jesus did not write these letters . They were mainly written by a Jewish man called Paul . At first he tried to stop Christianity from spreading . Then he became a Christian himself and was an important leader . As Christian churches started in different towns and countries , Paul wrote letters to them . A lot of the ideas that Christians believe are written in Paul 's letters . There is also lots of instruction for running churches and families .
There are other letters in the New Testament by other writers including Peter , James , and John . These letters all help to build the beliefs that modern Christians have . People of other faiths do not use the letters , and do not agree with the Christian teachings .
Whether or not Jesus is God has been argued about for a long time . Most Christians , including those from Catholic , Orthodox and Protestant denominations , believe Jesus was both God and man . Jesus is described in different parts of the New Testament as being `` the Word of God '' , `` the Son of God '' , `` the Son of Man '' , and even God himself .
These teachings , which are believed by most Christians , are not believed by many other people . The Islamic teaching is that Jesus was a prophet , but he was not part of God or the `` Son of God '' . In Jesus ' own time , many Jews became very angry at Jesus for saying that he was the `` Son of God '' and also because his followers said he was the `` Messiah '' . Most Jews do not believe this .
`` In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God and the Word was God . He was in the beginning with God . '' John 1:1 -3 , ESV
`` The Word became a human being . He made his home with us . We have seen his glory . It is the glory of the one and only Son . He came from the Father . And he was full of grace and truth . '' John 1:14 , NIRV
`` Jesus said ... ' I and the Father are one . ' '' John 10:30 , ESV
`` Christ is God over all , blessed forever . '' Romans 9:5 , ESV
'' -LRB- We are -RRB- waiting for our blessed hope , the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ . '' Titus 2:13 , ESV
`` In -LRB- Jesus -RRB- the fullness of the deity dwells bodily . '' Colossians 2:9 , ESV
Jesus is also referred to as `` the Son of God '' .
`` And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us , and we have seen his glory , glory as of the only Son from the Father , full of grace and truth . '' John 1:14 , ESV
`` In these last days he has spoken to us by his Son , whom he appointed the heir of all things , through whom also he created the world . He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature , and he upholds the universe by the word of his power . '' Hebrews 1:2 -3 , ESV
`` And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding , so that we may know him who is true ; and we are in him who is true , in his Son Jesus Christ . He is the true God and eternal life . '' 1 John 5:20 , ESV . This letter is thought to be by the same John that wrote John 's Gospel .
All Christians believe that these verses say Jesus is God . All Christians believe that Jesus ' death on the cross allows all people to be forgiven by God for their sins -LRB- bad things they have done -RRB- . Most Christians believe that if a person asks God to forgive them He will do so , and they will get to live forever with him in Heaven .
Christians believe that , by the teaching of the Bible , Jesus was not only truly God but also truly human and that this was part of God 's plan to bring humans closer to understanding him . People who do not have Christian beliefs , believe that Jesus was an ordinary person , and not God made human .
Verses from the Bible : - '' ... and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us . '' John , 1:14
In Matthew 's Gospel , Jesus is often called `` the Son of Man '' . Matthew has borrowed these words from the Old Testament where they are often used to show that humankind is very far from God . In the Bible , God is often praised and thanked for helping ordinary humans , who are called `` the sons of man '' . In Psalm 8 , the writer , King David , asks God `` What is man and the son of man , that you should care so much and give him such wonderful power over the Earth and all its creatures ? ''
In Matthew 's Gospel , 24:30 Jesus says '' . . They shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of Heaven with power and great glory . '' Like King David , in Psalm 8 , Jesus is making a difference between his ordinary human life and his great power as the Son of God .
One of the best-loved parts of the Old Testament is a song called Psalm 23 . It starts : `` The Lord is my shepherd ; then I will not want anything more . He leads me by still water and in green fields . ''
In the Gospels , Jesus often spoke about himself as being like a shepherd , caring for sheep . He called himself the `` Good Shepherd '' who would even give his own life , to protect his sheep . He told the Jewish people , referring to non-Jewish or Gentile believers , that he had `` other sheep '' that do not belong to this flock . -LRB- John , 21:16 -RRB- . In one of his last conversations with his disciple Peter , he told him , `` Feed my sheep ! '' , in other words `` Take care of my people . '' .
In Jewish religion , from ancient times , there was a belief that humankind was `` sinful '' -LRB- did things that were bad -RRB- and that people needed to be forgiven by God . They believed that there were two ways to get God 's forgiveness , by prayer and by sacrifice . Prayer could be done anywhere , but sacrifices were done at the temple . A person would bring an animal , often a lamb , or if they were poor , a dove . They would put their hands on the animal to lay their sins on it . Then the animal would be killed , as a punishment for the sin . This type of sacrifice continued until the temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in 71 AD . Paying money to the temple was also a sort of sacrifice . When Jesus drove the traders out of the temple , they were the people who sold lambs and doves , and the people who exchanged Roman money into special temple money .
Part of Christian belief is that Jesus Christ did not just come as a human person so that he could teach a better way of life . Christians also believe that Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice for the sin of humankind , that Jesus is the `` Saviour '' : the one who is here to save . Christians believe that , unlike ordinary people , Jesus was completely pure and free from sin , but that when he died on the cross , he took on himself all the sins of every person who would believe in him , like the lamb sacrificed in the temple .
Based on John 's Gospel , Christian teaching is that the death and resurrection of Jesus are the sign of his power to forgive the sins of any person who turns to him and truly asks for forgiveness . The Bible says that sinners who are forgiven should try to live a new life and not go back to their sinful behavior . Christians believe that knowing about God 's love helps people to live a new and better life .
`` God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son , so that , whoever believes might not die but have eternal life . '' ' John 's Gospel , 3:16 .
Jesus said : `` I am the way , the truth and the life . If anyone comes to the Father , they must come by me ! '' John 's Gospel , 14:6 .
`` If we say we have no sins , we are fooling ourselves and not telling the truth . But if we tell our sins humbly to God , then He has promised to listen and to forgive our sins and make us clean from all our badness . '' from the First Letter of John .
Some people who are not Christians believe that Jesus lived at the time that the Gospels say , but do not believe that Jesus was the `` Son of God '' or `` Saviour '' . They believe that Jesus was an ordinary , but very good person , a teacher and perhaps a prophet .
Some people accept Jesus as a moral example without any connection to a God . Mohandas Gandhi said , `` I am a Muslim , and a Hindu , and a Christian , and a Jew , '' even though he was born a Jain . Gandhi worked hard in his life to make the followers of all these religions respect each other . This is how many people see Jesus , too - a teacher who said that all people were neighbors and that Jews , Romans , Greeks , Samaritans and other people should all live in peace with each other .
Muslims consider Jesus -LRB- under the name Isa -RRB- to be the second-to-last Prophet -LRB- messenger of God -RRB- , and Muhammad to have been the very last Prophet . They believe that Jesus and Muhammad were both ordinary men chosen by God .
Muslims do not believe that Jesus was God or `` the Son of God '' . Islam is strictly monotheistic and thus any inclinations towards deification of an individual apart from God is viewed as idolatry and polytheism . They believe that Jesus can not be part of God , because there is only one God . Islam teaches that Jesus did not die on the cross , but that he was raised to Heaven in body and soul . -LRB- The death of Jesus is essential to Christian belief about salvation . -RRB- Muslims always say `` peace be upon him '' after saying Jesus ' name as a sign of respect .
Among the teachings accepted by Muslims are that Jesus will return to the earth in the End Of Days , and that he will destroy the false messiah or anti-Christ prior to the day of judgment . Muslims also accept Jesus ' claims to be a healer and believe in the many miracles attributed to him such as raising the dead to life , giving sight to the blind etc and believe that all his miracles were granted to him from God .
Even though Jesus was a Jew and his teaching came out of the Jewish religion , most Jewish people do not believe that Jesus was the Messiah that is promised in the Jewish Scriptures .
In the Gospels , it tells that Jesus made the Jewish teachers very angry with his teachings . It says that part of their anger was because he told them they were `` hypocrites '' which means that they externally made themselves appear to be living a holy life , but internally their hearts were far from God 's .
In the Gospels , the other reason that they became angry was that Jesus acted as if he was the Messiah , and said he was the `` Son of God '' . This meant that he was either a terrible liar , that he was mad and just imagined it , or that it was true . But Jesus did not seem to be mad . So that left only two choices . If Jesus was lying , then he was doing something badly against the Jewish religion . It was because of the claims that Jesus was the `` Son of God '' that some of the Jewish leaders wanted him killed and they handed him to the Roman rulers . The Romans did not care if Jesus said something that was against the Jewish beliefs . But they knew that people had also said that Jesus was `` King of the Jews '' . The Jewish leaders claimed this was against the Roman Government 's laws . Although the Roman leaders did not agree , they had him killed to prevent a possible riot .
Although , today and through history , most Jews do not believe what Christians say about Jesus , there are some Jews who do believe that Jesus was the Messiah promised in the Jewish Scriptures . Jews who believe this are called `` Messianic Jews '' .
Some writers have said that perhaps Jesus never existed . Ideas have been put forward that the whole of the Gospel writing about Jesus is just a good story or myth and that Jesus perhaps never existed .
Other writers have shown that parts of the story of Jesus are similar to other religions such as the stories of Gilgamesh and Mithras . They also show that Christianity holds its main Holy Days at a time when there was already a Roman or Jewish festival such as Easter at the time of the Passover .
In the later part of the 20th century and in the 21st century nearly all scholars , both Christian and non-Christian agree that Jesus was a real historic person . Both Christian and non-Christian scholars base their studies of him on the Gospels . They are believed to have been written between 60-90 AD .
One of the main reasons that most scholars believe in the real existence of Jesus is that someone in the 1st century AD must have lived and taught the things which Jesus taught . Some real person must have started the Christian Church . Whether or not that person was called Jesus , their ideas were so powerful that they changed the world .
By tradition , the Gospels were written by four men , Matthew , Mark , Luke and John who gave their names to these books . This is the order in which they are arranged in the New Testament of the Bible , but scholars think that it is not the order in which they were written . The Gospel of Mark was probably written before the Gospel of Matthew . The four Gospels all tell the story of the Life of Jesus , but they do it from four different points of view , because they were written by different people and each writer had reasons to tell it in a different way .
Other scholars have said that leaders in the Early Christian Church made changes to the Gospel writings . These changes are said to have happened at different times , in different ways and for different reasons . For example , one story was left out of many old versions of the Gospels . It is about Jesus rescuing a woman who had committed adultery -LRB- had sex outside marriage -RRB- and was about to be killed . St. Augustine of Hippo , -LRB- 354-430 AD -RRB- wrote that this was probably was left out because some church leaders thought the story might cause people to act in a sinful way . This story is in all modern Bibles and is thought to contain very important teaching for Christians . Other differences that can be found in versions of the Gospels are mostly small and do not make a difference to what is known about the life of Jesus and his teaching .
Mark 's Gospel , which is thought by biblical scholars to be the earliest , has the name of a young disciple of the apostle Paul who is mentioned several times in the `` Acts of the Apostles '' and Paul 's Letters . The Gospel was probably written in Rome and is thought by scholars to be from the memories of Jesus ' follower or disciple , Peter . It does not tell about Jesus ' birth ; it starts when he was 30 year old , at the time when the disciples got to know him . It shows Jesus as a man of action : going around the country , teaching and healing people .
Matthew 's Gospel was written next . Matthew was one of Jesus ' disciples . He was a Jewish man that was hated by other Jews because he worked for the Roman rulers as a tax collector . Matthew tells that one day Jesus saw him sitting at his desk in the market place and said `` Follow me ! '' . Most Biblical scholars believe that Matthew had read Mark 's Gospel and decided to fill in some things that Mark left out , because , while Mark wrote his Gospel for the Church of Rome , Matthew wanted to write for Jewish Christians all over the Roman Empire . Matthew was a well-educated Jew , so he knew the Jewish Scriptures , -LRB- which Christians also use and call the Old Testament of the Bible -RRB- . Matthew knew the scripture teachings that the Messiah , or God 's anointed one would come . In his Gospel , he often mentions these teachings . He also starts off by giving a list of Jesus ' ancestors because this was important to Jewish readers .
The apostle Luke was Greek and a friend of the apostle Paul . He was a doctor . Luke came to know about Jesus from the disciples . Luke writes about the birth and the childhood of Jesus and he says `` Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them . '' Luke was not a Jew and he writes in a way that is easy for other people who are not Jews to understand . He explains Jewish customs and laws . He wrote a second book called the Acts of the Apostles which tells what the disciples did after Jesus had left them .
It is believed by scholars of the Bible that John was a disciple of Jesus and was probably the youngest of the twelve men who were Jesus ' main followers . He lived to be an old man and , because of his teaching about Jesus , he was sent to a small island , Patmos . In his old age he wrote two important books , of which one is John 's Gospel .
John writes with one particular idea in mind . He wants to prove to the reader that Jesus is God 's way of saving humans from the terrible problem of sin or evil . John starts by telling the reader that Jesus was -LRB- and is -RRB- God . John says that Jesus is God 's Living Communication -LRB- or Living Word -RRB- . Every part of John 's Gospel is written to show that Jesus came from God , taught the Message of God and is the way for people to understand God 's Love .
The Gospels tell many of the stories that Jesus told when he was teaching people about the way that God loved them and the way they should live . Two of the most famous stories are the story of `` the Prodigal Son '' and the story of `` the Good Samaritan '' . In the first story it is shown how much God loves his people and in the second story is shown how people should love each other .
In this story from Luke 's Gospel , Jesus tells how a rich man had two sons . They would both get a share of his money , when he died . The younger son said , `` Father , give me my money now , so I can go and enjoy myself , while I 'm young . '' He took the money to the city , and spent it all on parties with his friends . Soon he had none left to feed himself . He was ashamed . He got a job caring for pigs , but he was almost starving . He said to himself , `` I 'll go home to my father and I will say ` Father , I have sinned ! Please let me be a servant in your house ! ' ''
As he went home , he did not know that his father looked out for him , every day . When his father saw him coming , he ran along the road to put his arms around his son . The son said `` Father , I have sinned ! Please let me be a servant in your house ! '' The father said `` Bring the finest clothes ! Kill the fattest calf to make a feast ! '' When the elder brother heard all this , he was angry and said `` I 'm a good son to you , but you never even gave me one little goat to have a party with my friends ! '' The father said `` You have always been with me . I love you greatly , and all I have is yours , but my son who was lost is now found ! My son who seemed to be dead is alive ! Be happy with me ! '' Jesus said that this is the way God loves and forgives his people , when they ask for forgiveness .
In this story from Luke 's Gospel , Jesus shows what it means to be a good neighbor . Near the Jews lived the Samaritans . They followed the Hebrew Scriptures , but they worshiped differently to the Jews , so the Jews were prejudiced against them . One day , a Jewish man was on a journey when a band of robbers beat him up , robbed him and left him naked and almost dead , by the road . A Jewish priest came along and saw him . He thought , `` If I touch that naked bleeding man , I will be unclean and I will not be able to go to the Temple ! '' So he pretended that he had not seen him . Another Jew , a Holy Man , came along and acted in the same way . At last a Samaritan came along with a donkey . When he saw the wounded man he stopped . He washed his wounds with wine and olive oil . Then he put him on his donkey and took him to the nearest inn . He paid the innkeeper and said `` Keep him until he is well , and whatever is owing , I will pay when I come back this way . '' Jesus said to the people who were listening `` Which one of these people acted like a good neighbor ? '' They said `` He that stopped and helped . '' Jesus said `` You go and act the same way .

Bathing is putting the body into a fluid , most often water , or a solution with water . Usually it is done for hygiene or for religious purposes , or for fun . Sometimes bathing is also done as a form of therapy .
When people talk about bathing , they most often mean being immersed in water . But people have also `` bathed '' in other substances . SOme therapies involve bathing in mud . People have also bathed in other substances , like Champagne , beans , or chocolate . A form of bathing quite common is bathing in sunlight .
`` Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds '' is a song written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney for the Beatles ' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band .
Lennon 's son , Julian , inspired the song with a nursery school drawing he called `` Lucy â '' in the sky with diamonds '' . Shortly after the song 's release , people realized that the first letter of each of the title 's nouns spelled LSD . Though Lennon denied and mocked the idea of a hidden LSD reference , the BBC banned the song .
According to the Beatles , Lennon 's son , Julian Lennon showed his father a nursery school drawing he called Lucy - in the sky with diamonds , depicting his classmate , Lucy O'Donnell . Julian said , `` I do n't know why I called it that or why it stood out from all my other drawings , but I obviously had an affection for Lucy at that age . I used to show dad everything I 'd built or painted at school , and this one sparked off the idea ... '' Lucy Vodden nÃ e O'Donnell died of an immune system disease in 2009 .
Lennon was surprised at the idea that the song title was a hidden reference to LSD .
Rolling Stone magazine described the song as `` Lennon 's lavish daydream '' and music critic Richie Unterberger said '' ` Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds ' was one of the best songs on the Beatles ' famous Sgt. Pepper album , and one of the classic songs of psychedelia as a whole . There are few other songs that so successfully evoke a dream world , in both the sonic textures and words . '' In a review for the BBC , Chris Jones described the song as `` nursery rhyme surrealism '' that contributed to Sgt. Pepper 's `` revolutionary ... sonic carpet that enveloped the ears and sent the listener spinning into other realms . ''
In later interviews , Lennon expressed disappointment with the Beatles ' arrangement of the recording , complaining that inadequate time was taken to fully develop his initial idea for the song . He also said that he felt he did n't think that he sang it very well . `` I was so nervous I could n't sing , '' he told the journalist Ray Connolly , `` but I like the lyrics . ''
A 3.2 million year-old , 40 % complete fossil skeleton of an Australopithecus afarensis specimen discovered in 1974 was named `` Lucy '' because the Beatles song was being played loudly and repeatedly on a tape recorder in the camp .
The White dwarf star BPM 37093 , which contains a core of crystallized carbon roughly 4000 km in diameter , is informally named `` Lucy '' as a tribute to the Beatles song .

In Major League Baseball , the Rookie of the Year Award is given each year to one player from each league as voted on by the Baseball Writers Association of America -LRB- BBWAA -RRB- . The award was start in 1940 by the Chicago chapter of the BBWAA . They selected a winner every year from 1940 through 1946 . The award became national in 1947 ; Jackie Robinson , the Brooklyn Dodgers ' first baseman , won the first award . One award was presented for both leagues in 1947 and 1948 ; since 1949 , the honor has been given to one player each in the National and American League . At first , the award was known as the J. Louis Comiskey Memorial Award , named after the Chicago White Sox owner of the 1930s . The award was renamed the Jackie Robinson Award in July 1987 , 40 years after Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line .
Of the 128 players named Rookie of the Year , 14 have been selected for the National Baseball Hall of Fameâ '' Jackie Robinson , five American League players , and eight others from the National League . The award has been shared twice : once by Butch Metzger and Pat Zachry of the National League in 1976 ; and once by John Castino and Alfredo Griffin of the American League in 1979 . Members of the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers have won the most awards of any team -LRB- with 16 -RRB- . This is twice the total of the New York Yankees -LRB- eight -RRB- , who have won the most in the American League . Fred Lynn and Ichiro Suzuki are the only two players who have been named Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player in the same year . Fernando Valenzuela is the only player to have won Rookie of the Year and the Cy Young Award in the same year . Sam Jethroe is the oldest player to have won the award , at age 32 , 33 days older than 2000 winner Kazuhiro Sasaki -LRB- also 32 -RRB- . Buster Posey of the San Francisco Giants and Neftali Feliz of the Texas Rangers are the 2010 winners .
From 1947 through 1956 , each BBWAA voter had their own rules for decide who was a rookie . In 1957 , the BBWAA first defined the term as someone with fewer than 75 at bats or 45 innings pitched in any Major League season before the current season . This guideline was later changed to 90 at bats , 45 innings pitched , or 45 days on a Major League roster before September 1 of the last year . The current rule is 130 at bats , 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster of a Major League club -LRB- except for time in military service or on the disabled list -RRB- before September 1 was first used in 1971 . Since 1980 , each voter names three rookies : a first-place choice is given five points , a second-place choice three points , and a third-place choice one point . The award goes to the player who receives the most total points . Edinson Volquez received three second-place votes in 2008 even though he was not a rookie under the award 's definition .
Some baseball writers have criticized the voting in recent years because several players who played in Nippon Professional Baseball -LRB- NPB -RRB- have won the award . These winners include Hideo Nomo in 1995 , Kazuhiro Sasaki in 2000 , and Ichiro Suzuki in 2001 . The current definition of rookie for the award is based only on Major League playing . Some writers feel that past NPB players are not true rookies because of their past professional playing . This issue came up in 2003 when Hideki Matsui lost the AL award to Ã ngel Berroa in a close vote . Jim Souhan of the Minneapolis Star Tribune said he did not think Matsui was a rookie in 2003 because `` it would be an insult to the Japanese league to pretend that experience did n't count . '' The Japan Times had a story in 2007 on calling Daisuke Matsuzaka , Kei Igawa , and Hideki Okajima as rookies , saying '' -LRB- t -RRB- hese guys are n't rookies . '' Past winners such as Jackie Robinson , Don Newcombe , and Sam Jethroe had professional experience in the Negro Leagues .

Johann Nepomuk Hummel -LRB- born Pressburg November 14 1778 ; died Weimar October 17 1837 -RRB- was an Austrian composer and pianist . He was a child prodigy . His family moved to Vienna when he was eight . Mozart thought he was so talented that he taught him free of charge . Hummel became one of the greatest pianists and composers in Europe . He always wrote in a Classical style , he never became an early Romantic like Beethoven .
Sir Julian Sorell Huxley FRS -LRB- 22 June 1887 -- 14 February 1975 -RRB- was an English evolutionary biologist , humanist and internationalist . He was a proponent of natural selection , and a leading figure in the modern evolutionary synthesis .
He was Secretary of the Zoological Society of London -LRB- 1935 â `` 1942 -RRB- , the first Director of UNESCO , and a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund .
Huxley came from the distinguished Huxley family . His brother was the writer Aldous Huxley , and his half-brother , a fellow biologist and Nobel laureate , Andrew Huxley ; and his paternal grandfather was Thomas Henry Huxley , a friend and supporter of Charles Darwin and proponent of evolution .
Huxley was well-known for his presentation of science in books and articles , and on radio and television . He was awarded UNESCO 's Kalinga Prize for the popularisation of science in 1953 , the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society in 1956 , and the Darwin-Wallace medal of the Linnaean Society in 1958 . He was also knighted in that same year , 1958 , a hundred years after Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace announced the theory of evolution by natural selection . In 1959 he received a Special Award of the Lasker Foundation in the category Planned Parenthood â `` World Population . Huxley was a prominent member of the British Eugenics Society .
His particular interest was bird behavior , especially the courtship of water birds . His observations on the ethology of the Great Crested Grebe , published in 1914 , was a landmark in avian field research . His invention of vivid labels for the rituals -LRB- such as ` penguin dance ' , ` plesiosaurus race ' etc. -RRB- made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader .
Huxley was the most important biologist after August Weismann to insist on natural selection as the primary agent in evolution . A fine communicator , he was a prominent populariser of biological science to the public . In the early 20th century he was one of the minority of biologists who believed that natural selection was the main driving force of evolution , and that evolution occurred by small steps and not by jumps . These opinions are now standard . Though his time as an academic was quite brief , he taught and encouraged a number of evolutionary biologists at the University of Oxford in the 1920s .
Huxley was a key figure in the modern evolutionary synthesis . This explained how the discoveries of Gregor Mendel on genetics fitted with Charles Darwin 's theory of evolution by means of natural selection . Huxley 's
Huxley 's first ` trial run ' was the treatment of evolution in the Science of Life -LRB- 1929 â `` 30 -RRB- , and in 1936 he published a long and significant paper for the British Association . In 1938 came three lengthy reviews on major evolutionary topics .
Now it was time for Huxley to tackle the subject of evolution at full length , in what became the defining work of his life . His book Evolution : the modern synthesis was written whilst he was Secretary to the Zoological Society , and made use of his remarkable collection of reprints covering the first part of the century . It was published in 1942 . Reviews of the book in learned journals were little short of ecstatic ; the American Naturalist called it `` The outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade , perhaps of the century . The approach is thoroughly scientific ; the command of basic information amazing '' .
Huxley 's main co-respondents in the modern evolutionary synthesis are usually listed as Ernst Mayr , Theodosius Dobzhansky , George Gaylord Simpson , Bernhard Rensch , Ledyard Stebbins and the population geneticists J.B.S. Haldane , Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright . However , at the time of Huxley 's book , several of these had yet to make their distinctive contribution . E.B. Ford and his co-workers in ecological genetics were at least as important .
He always believed that on a broad view evolution led to advances in organization . `` Progress without a goal '' was one of his favorite phrases .
In the final chapter of his Evolution the modern synthesis he defines evolutionary progress as `` a raising of the upper level of biological efficiency , this being defined as increased control over and independence of the environment . `` Natural selection plus time produces biological improvement ... Improvements in biological machinery ... the limbs and teeth of grazing horses ... the increase in brain-power ... The eyes of a dragon-fly , which can see all round -LRB- it -RRB- in every direction , are an improvement over the mere microscopic eye-spots of early forms of life '' . '' -LRB- Over -RRB- the whole range of evolutionary time we see general advance â '' improvement in all the main properties of life , including its general organization . -LRB- But -RRB- improvement is not universal . Lower forms manage to survive alongside higher '' .
Huxley was a prominent member of the British Eugenics Society , and was Vice-President -LRB- 1937 â `` 1944 -RRB- and President -LRB- 1959 â `` 1962 -RRB- . Huxley was one of many intellectuals at the time who believed that the lowest class in society was genetically inferior . He advocated `` the virtual elimination of the few lowest and most degenerate types '' . In his writing he used this argument several times : no-one doubts the wisdom of managing the germ-plasm of agricultural stocks , so why not apply the same concept to human stocks ? .
In the post-war years , after the realisation that eugenic ideas had become tainted by the Nazis , Huxley -LRB- 1957 -RRB- coined the term `` transhumanism '' to describe the view that man should better himself through science and technology , possibly including eugenics , but also , importantly , the improvement of the social environment .
In response to the rise of European fascism in the 1930s Huxley was asked to write We Europeans with three other scientists . Huxley suggested the word ` race ' be replaced with ethnic group . After the Second World War he was instrumental in producing the UNESCO statement The Race Question , which asserted that : `` A race , from the biological standpoint , may therefore be defined as one of the group of populations constituting the species Homo sapiens '' ... `` Now what has the scientist to say about the groups of mankind which may be recognized at the present time ? Human races can be and have been differently classified by different anthropologists , but at the present time most anthropologists agree on classifying the greater part of present-day mankind into three major divisions , as follows : The Mongoloid Division ; The Negroid Division ; The Caucasoid Division . '' ... `` Catholics , Protestants , Moslems and Jews are not races ... ''
The Inline-four engine or Straight-four is an internal combustion engine with all four cylinders . All four cylinders are mounted in a straight line along one crankshaft . It can be powered by different types of fuels , including gasoline , diesel and natural gas .
The single bank of cylinders may be in a vertical direction -LRB- straight up -RRB- , or at an angle . When the cylinders are mounted at an angle , it is sometimes called a slant-four . When listed as an abbreviation , an inline-four engine is listed either as I4 or L4 -LRB- for longitudinal -RRB- . L4 is often used to avoid confusion between the digit 1 and the letter I.
The inline-four layout is a mechanically simple engine . It has a natural basic engine balance . It is smoother than one , two , and three cylinder engines . This makes it popular for economy cars . It does have a problem with secondary engine balance . This causes minor vibrations in smaller engines . These vibrations become worse as engine size and power increase . The more powerful engines used in larger cars use different a engine layout to avoid this problem .
This inline-four gasoline configuration is the most common in cars with a displacement -LRB- engine size -RRB- up to 2.4 L. Porsche used a 3.0 L four in its 944 S2 and 968 sports cars . Antique vehicles tended to have larger displacements to develop horsepower and torque . The Model A Ford was built with a 3.3 L inline-four engine .
Four-cylinder diesel engines are lower revving than gasoline engines . They often exceed 3.0 L. Toyota made a 4.1 L diesel engine that was used in the Toyota Mega Cruiser . Larger four-cylinder engines are used in industrial applications , are often made with displacements up to about 4.6 L.
Displacement can also be very small . Some cars sold in Japan have engines that are only 660 cc .
The 1913 Indianapolis 500 was won by Jules Goux driving a Peugeot . This car was powered by an inline-four engine designed by Ernest Henry . This design was big influence for racing engines . It was the first to use dual overhead camshafts -LRB- DOHC -RRB- and four valves per cylinder . This became the standard design for racing inline-four engines .
This Peugeot was sold to the American driver `` Wild Bob '' Burman . Burman broke the engine in 1915 . Because of World War I , Peugeot could n't deliver a new engine . Burman asked Harry Arminius Miller to build a new engine . With John Edward and Fred Offenhauser , Miller created a new engine . Its design was based on the Peugeot inline-four engine . This was the first version of the engine that would dominate the Indianapolis 500 until 1976 . At first , the engine was named Miller . Later it became known as Offenhauser . The Offenhauser engines won five straight races at Indianapolis from 1971 to 1976 . It was not until 1981 that engines such as the Cosworth V8 engine eliminated them .
Many cars produced for the pre-WWII voiturette Grand Prix motor racing used inline-four engine designs . These cars were rebuilt and reused after the war . They formed the beginnings of what is now Formula One .
Modern inline-four motorcycle engines first gained their popularity with Honda 's single overhead camshaft CB750 in the 1970s . The inline-four has become one of the most common engine configurations in street bikes The inline-four is common because of its relatively high performance-to-cost ratio . All of the Japanese motorcycle manufacturers offer motorcycles with inline-four engines .
Monounsaturated fats are found in food items , more particularly natural foods like nuts and avocados . They are the main component in olive oil -LRB- oleic acid -RRB- .
In general , these fats are considered to be healthier as compared to the others . They have the same amount of energy , but they reduce blood cholesterol levels . This reduces the risk to the heart .
The Armenian Highland -LRB- also known as the Armenian Upland or Armenian Plateau -RRB- is part of the Transcaucasian Highland and constitutes the continuation of the Caucasus mountains , also referred as eastern Armenia .
The apricot is native to China and spread to Europe through the Armenia Highlands . It came to be known throughout the ancient world as the Armenian fruit . Its botanical name Prunus armeniaca , derives from the Latin vernacular for apricot , armeniacum , which some scholars have linked to its Akkadian name armanu .
Many scholars place the Indo-European homeland in the Armenian Highlands and the plateau of Asia Minor to the southwest . Others believe that it was in Eastern Europe or southern Russia .
Some scholars believe , for example , that the earliest mention of the Armenians is in the Akkadian inscriptions dating to the 28th-27th centuries BC , in which the Armenians are referred to as the sons of Haya , after the regional god of the Armenian Highlands .
Maui is the second largest of the Hawaiian Islands , in the United States . It has a population of just over 100,000 and is 727 square miles -LRB- 1883 kmÂ -RRB- in size . Maui is part of Maui County , Hawaii . The larger -LRB- or better known -RRB- towns include Kahului , Wailuku , Lahaina , Hana , and Wailea . Main industries are agriculture and tourism .
Maui was named for the demi-god Maui . In Hawaiian legend , he raised all the islands from the sea . Maui is also known as the `` Valley Isle '' for the large fertile isthmus -LRB- narrow land connection -RRB- between two volcanoes .
Maui is a volcanic doublet : an island formed from two volcanic mountains that are joined together . The older volcano , Mauna Kahalawai , is much older and has been very worn down . In common talk it is called the West Maui Mountain . The larger volcano , Haleakala , rises above 10,000 feet -LRB- 3,050 m -RRB- . The last eruption of Haleakala happened over 200 years ago , and this lava flow can be seen between Ahihi Bay and La Perouse Bay on the southeast shore .
The term `` Iron Man '' is used in multiple sports for players with long streaks of consecutive games . For example , the term `` Iron Man of Baseball '' refers to either Lou Gehrig or Cal Ripken , Jr. .
Yangon , also known as Rangoon , is the largest city in Myanmar . It was also the capital city until 2006 . The city is by a river called Hlaing River , and is close to the sea . Yangon has more than 4 million people living there . Yangon was founded as Dagon in the 6th century AD by the Mons , who ruled Lower Burma at that time . Dagon was a small fishing village centered about the Shwedagon Pagoda . In 1755 , King Alaungpaya conquered Dagon and renamed it `` Yangon '' . The British captured Yangon during the First Anglo-Burmese War -LRB- 1824 â `` 26 -RRB- but returned it to Burma after the war . The city was destroyed by a fire in 1841 .
The British took Yangon and all of Lower Burma in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852 , and then changed Yangon into the most important city of British Burma . The British constructed a new city on a grid plan on delta land . It was bound to the east by the Pazundaung Creek and to the south and west by the Yangon River . Yangon became the capital of all British Burma after the British had captured Upper Burma in the Third Anglo-Burmese War of 1885 . By the 1890s Yangon 's increasing population and commerce gave birth to prosperous residential suburbs to the north of Royal Lake -LRB- Kandawgyi -RRB- and Inya Lake . The British also established hospitals including Rangoon General Hospital and colleges including Rangoon University . Colonial Yangon , with its spacious parks and lakes and mix of modern buildings and traditional wooden architecture , was known as `` the garden city of the East . '' By the early 20th century , Yangon had public services and infrastructure on par with London .
Before World War II , about 55 % of Yangon 's population of 500,000 was Indian or South Asian , and only about a third was Bamar -LRB- Burman -RRB- . Karens , the Chinese , the Anglo-Burmese and others made up the rest .
After World War I , Yangon became the center of Burmese independence movement . The leftist Rangoon University students led the way . Three nationwide strikes against the British Empire in 1920 , 1936 and 1938 began in Yangon . Yangon was under Japan 's occupation -LRB- 1942 â `` 45 -RRB- , and was heavily damage during World War II . Yangon became the capital of Union of Burma on 4 January 1948 when the country regained independence from the British Empire .

Calluna vulgaris -LRB- known as Common Heather , or simply heather -RRB- is the sole species in the genus Calluna in the family Ericaceae .
It is a low-growing perennial shrub growing to 20 t tall , or rarely to 1 m. It is found widely in Europe and Asia Minor on acidic soils in open sunny situations and in moderate shade .
Heather is the dominant plant on most heaths and moorland in Europe , and in some bog vegetation and acidic pine and oak woodland . It is tolerant of grazing and regenerates following occasional burning . It is often managed in nature reserves and grouse moors by sheep or cattle grazing , and also by light burning .
The flowers emerge in late summer ; in wild plants these are normally mauve , but white-flowered plants also occur occasionally .
Heather is an important food source for various sheep and deer which can graze the tips of the plants when snow covers low growing vegetation . Willow Grouse and Red Grouse feed on the young shoots and seeds of this plant . Both adults and larvae of the Heather Beetle Lochmaea suturalis feed on it , and can cause damage . The larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species also feed on the plant .
Heather honey is a highly valued product in moorland and heathland areas , with many beehives being moved there in late summer . It has a strong taste , and an unusual texture . It is thixotropic , being a jelly until stirred , when it becomes a syrup -LRB- like other honey -RRB- , but then sets again to a jelly . This makes the extraction of the honey from the comb difficult , and it is therefore often sold as comb honey .
Heather is seen as iconic of Scotland , where the plant grows widely . When poems like Bonnie Auld Scotland speak of `` fragrant hills of purple heather ' , when the hero of Kidnapped flees through the heather , when heather and Scotland are linked in the same sentence , the heather talked about is Calluna vulgaris .

A bratwurst is a kind of food . It is a type of sausage . It is composed of pork or beef , and sometimes veal . Bratwurst is German , from Old High German brÃ twurst , from brÃ t which is a derivative of the Old High German word `` brato '' . `` Brato '' originally meant hacked meat , intestines . The other part of the word is wurst which means sausage .
The original German `` Bratwurst '' comes from Thuringia . There it is known as ThÃ 1\/4 ringer Rostbratwurst . Small bratwursts originate in Nuremberg , Germany . Also famous are the original Coburger Rostbratwurst ; the more common longer , thicker form can be found almost anywhere else in Germany . A `` Bratwurst '' meal often is eaten with sauerkraut , mashed potatoes and roasted onions . Sometimes , it is also served with a potato sauce , or a potato salad .
There are many different kinds of these sausages . All are special in their own way .
The sausage is usually eaten with a hot or sweet German mustard or sliced and eaten as Currywurst . Sometimes , some hot French mustard is served as well . Bratwurst is almost always served with a hard German roll and usually accompanied by a beer . It is a popular snack in German-speaking countries , where it is sold at various fast food outlets and is often consumed while standing .
Vegetarians eat vegetarian sausages . This sausage does of course contain no meat . It is made of Tofu or Gluten .
In the United States , bratwurst are usually eaten with bread -LRB- a hot dog bun or a hardroll , for example -RRB- and topped with mustard and\/or many of the other condiments often eaten with hot dogs , including onions -LRB- grilled and\/or raw -RRB- , relish , sauerkraut , etc. . The bratwurst is occasionally eaten with a pair of brat links nestled in a buttered hardroll with these same toppings , which is called a ` double brat ' .
Within the US , bratwurst is strongly identified with Milwaukee , Wisconsin , and other areas in a band stretching from the north side of Chicago up through Minnesota and scattered pockets elsewhere in the Midwest .
They are especially popular in areas of the US where German-Americans settled in large numbers , like Sheboygan , Wisconsin , which is informally known as the Bratwurst Capital of the World because of the city and county 's very strong German roots and connections to bratwurst . Johnsonville Foods , the nation 's largest bratwurst maker , is based in the nearby unincorporated village of Johnsonville . The city also celebrates Sheboygan Bratwurst Days , a community festival held on the first Thursday-Saturday of August each year that celebrates the bratwurst . Other traditional Wisconsin brat manufacturers include Klement 's Sausage Company and Usinger 's , both of which are based in Milwaukee .
The city of Madison , Wisconsin , holds an annual festival billed as the World 's Largest Brat Fest . The four-day charity event sees tens of thousands of brats sold by `` celebrity '' cashiers , usually local television , radio , and government personalities . Brat Fest 's self-proclaimed world record is 189,432 brats consumed during the 2004 event .
Another town with German-American roots associated with bratwurst is Bucyrus , Ohio , which is known for its unique recipe incorporating fennel . It holds a bratwurst festival annually in mid-August attracting over 100,000 visitors annually .

Each concerto describes a season : Spring , Summer , Autumn , and Winter . he was very famous for his composition by the picolo , like , for example , `` il gradellino ''
Emperor Nintoku was the 16th emperor of Japan , according to the traditional order of succession . Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Nintoku to be possibly legendary , but probable . The name Nintoku-tenn Å was created for him posthumously by later generations .
No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign . The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as `` traditional '' until the reign of Emperor Kammu , who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty .
According to Nihon Shoki , Nintoku was the fourth son of Emperor Å jin and the father of three emperors â '' RichÅ `` , Hanzei , and IngyÅ .
Very little is known about the events of Nintoku 's life and reign . Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch , Emperor Kimmei .
Nintoku 's reign is marked by Japan 's first large-scale engineering projects .
This emperor 's posthumous name must must have been regularized many centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Nintoku .
According to the Imperial Household Agency , the emperor 's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus -LRB- kofun -RRB- at Sakai . Nintoku is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine -LRB- misasagi -RRB- which is associated with the burial mound .

The SchrÃ dinger equation is a mathematical formula that physicists use to study quantum mechanics . It is a mathematical equation that was thought of by Erwin SchrÃ dinger in 1925 . It shows how particles act in lots of time based situations . It can predict the position and velocity of a particle -LRB- where it is and how fast it is moving -RRB- at a certain time . It can not be very accurate , however , because of the uncertainty principle .
It uses something called a wavefunction to make questions about how the particle acts . The wavefunction is a picture of how this particle acts with time and describes the particle as fully as possible .

Eratosthenes of Cyrene 276BC â `` 194BC -RRB- was a third century BC Greek mathematician , geographer and astronomer . He was head of the Library of Alexandria from 240BC until his death : this was the most important library of the ancient world .
According to the Suda , his contemporaries nicknamed him Beta , -LRB- the second letter of the Greek alphabet -RRB- , because he was the second best in the world in almost any field . Eratosthenes was a friend of Archimedes , who also lived and worked in Alexandria . Archimedes was the greatest mathematician and inventor of the age , so perhaps the Beta nickname was not unjust .
The works Eratosthenes wrote are known to us only indirectly : the great Library was destroyed , and no copies survived . Strabo -LRB- ~ 63BC â `` 24AD -RRB- wrote about geography in antiquity . He tells us that the works of Eratosthenes were On the measurement of the Earth and Geographica .
Eratosthenes made several remarkable discoveries and inventions . He was the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth -LRB- with remarkable accuracy -RRB- , and he invented a system of latitude and longitude . He calculated the tilt of the earth 's axis -LRB- again with remarkable accuracy -RRB- ; he may also have accurately calculated the distance from the earth to the sun and invented the leap day . He created a map of the world based on the available geographical knowledge of the era . Eratosthenes was also the founder of scientific chronology ; he wanted to fix the dates of the chief literary and political events from the conquest of Troy .
Eratosthenes measured the circumference of the earth without leaving Egypt . He knew that on the summer solstice at local noon at the city now called Aswan on the Tropic of Cancer , the sun would appear at the zenith , directly overhead . He also knew , from measurement , that in Alexandria , the angle of elevation of the sun would be 1\/50 of a full circle -LRB- 7 Â 12 ' -RRB- south of the zenith at the same time . Assuming that Alexandria was due north of Syene he concluded that the distance from Alexandria to Syene must be 1\/50 of the total circumference of the earth . His estimated distance between the cities was 5000 stadia -LRB- about 500 geographical miles or 800km -RRB- by estimating the time that he had taken to travel from Syene to Alexandria by camel . He rounded the result to a final value of 700 stadia per degree , which implies a circumference of 252,000 stadia . The exact size of the stadion he used is frequently argued . The common Attic stadium was about 185 m , which would imply a circumference of 46,620 km , which is 16.3 % too large . However , if we assume that Eratosthenes used the `` Egyptian stadium '' of about 157.5 m , his measurement turns out to be 39,375 km , an error of less than 1 % . The method is an early application of trigonometry in the measurement science of geodesy .
In mathematics , the Sieve of Eratosthenes -LRB- Greek : Î Ï Ï Î Î Î 1\/2 Î Î 1\/2 á 1\/4 Ï Î Ï Î Ï Î Î Î 1\/2 Î Ï  It works efficiently for the smaller primes -LRB- below 10 million -RRB- . The sieve was described and attributed to Eratosthenes in the Introduction to Arithmetic by Nicomachus .
Eratosthenes went further and computed the tilt of the Earth 's axis to within a degree . This is the tilt which is the main cause of the annual climate cycle of spring , summer , autumn , winter . He also deduced the length of the year as 365 Â 1\/4 days . He suggested that calendars should have a leap day every fourth year , an idea taken up two centuries later by Julius Caesar .

Daejeon -LRB- in Korean language ë ì -RRB- is one of the major cities in South Korea , which is located in the middle of the Southern Korean Peninsula . Its official name is â Daejeon metropolitan cityâ and there are 6 existing metropolitan cities in Korea ; Daejeon , Busan , Gwangju , Incheon , Ulsan and Daegu . The population in Daejeon is around 1,480,895 , and the number of families is about 531,682 . There are 5 existing districts -LRB- in Korean language ê -LRB- Gu -RRB- -RRB- within Da Daejeon -LRB- in Korean language ë ì -RRB- is one of the major cities in South Korea , which is located in the middle of the Southern Korean Peninsula .
The history of Daejeon started as a small village called Hanbat , which is a different term in Korean Language that has the same meaning as Daejeon ; a grand field . From the meaning of the word we can guess that through the history , the major role of Hanbat has been related to agriculture . It is the Japanese occupation period when Daejeon started to develop as one of the major cities in Korea . Since the location of Daejeon is near to Seoul , the heart of Korea , the convenience of transportation has given it chance to open Ho-Nam train in 1914 . After liberation , in 1949 , Daejeon has aparted away from where it had been included , Chungcheong province and became the independent metropolitan city plays the same role as provinces .
Today , Daejeon has grown a lot bigger than before . It now plays a pivotal role of local self-governmental city in Korea . As more and more people come to Daejeon for living , the first subway station in Daejeon was opened in 2006 . The formal president Noh Mu Hyun once planned to move parts of the major public administration buildings in Seoul to Daejeon . The most definite image of Daejeon is the city of science and technology . It has Daedeock science research town , which was designed to support scientists and researchers in Daejeon . With diverse improvements done in Daejeon , in 1993 it successfully held Daejeon Expo Festival .
One of the most famous cultural values in Daejeon is Yuseong Hot Spring . It is near to subway station and many foreigners visit to enjoy the spa . Another famous cultural asset is Daejeon prehistory site . It is located in Seo-gu and includes the simulation of the lives of people from prehistoric ages . Famous people from Daejeon are Park Se Ri , a world famous golfer , and celebrities like Kwon Sang Woo and Park Hae Mi .

The 2009 stock is a type of London Underground train . It is built by Bombardier Transportation at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby , England . The Stock belongs to Bombardier 's Movia type of train . Bombardier Transportation UK used to be known as ADtranz , and before that ABB Asea Brown Boveri . ABB Asea Brown Boveri built the 1992 Stock which is currently used on the Central and Waterloo & City lines .
Forty-seven 8-car units will be built for use on the Victoria line . These will replace the line 's original 1967 Tube Stock . The trains are still being built . They will be introduced by 2012 , when all of the 1967 Stock trains will be completely replaced . The first 2009 Stock train started running on the line with passengers on board on 21 July 2009 . One new train will enter service every two weeks from early 2010 .
The trains are part of a 3.4 billion pound contract that was awarded to Bombardier by Metronet . The contract was to supply new trains featuring Automatic Train Operation and signalling for the Victoria and sub-surface lines . When it is finished this upgrade should make the lines and trains more reliable . There should also be an 8 % decrease in journey times between stations , and a 16 % overall decrease in journey times . This decrease is partly because the new trains have better performance that the 1967 Tube Stock that they are replacing . The new trains have a higher top speed of 80 k , a faster maximum acceleration of 1.3 m\/s2 , a normal service deceleration of 1.14 m\/s2 , and an emergency brake deceleration of 1.4 m\/s2 . This is the same as the 1992 Tube Stock .
During the busiest times of the day , or the `` peaks '' , 43 trains should be available in service . This will be an increase of 6 trains over the 37 units of 1967 Tube Stock . The trains have seats for 252 people and standing space for an estimated 1196 passengers . This gives a 19 % increase in capacity . The new trains also have wider doors for easier boarding and alighting -LRB- to descend or step down -RRB- of passengers to decrease the times that the trains have to wait at stations .
The new trains are being built 40 m wider than the current 1967 Tube Stock . This is because the Victoria line has a larger than normal loading gauge compared to the other deep level tube lines . . The larger size means that the new trains can not leave the Victoria line except by road as they are too wide to travel on the other London Underground deep level tube lines . This means that to move the units , each car has to be uncouple , loaded onto a lorry , and then re-coupled when they are delivered . The trains have been built using Bombardier 's technology called FICAS , which gives them a thinner bodyshell . Along with the larger size this gives more space for passengers .
The stock is the first to be designed since the Rail Vehicle Accessibilty Regulations came into force . Because of this they will have more facilities for people with impaired mobility , including multi-purpose areas with tip-up seats and space for wheelchairs and pushchairs and offset center door poles for wheelchair access .
The design of the trains was finalized in September 2004 , and manufacture of two pre-production trains began in January 2005 . The first train was scheduled to be completed by mid-2006 . Metronet announced on 3 February 2006 that the first of the pre-production cars had been completed to allow it to be tested without being moved . From 21 July until 4 August 2006 , a example of the train was on show at Euston Square Gardens , near Euston Square tube station , for a Customer Acceptance Test followed by public display . From September 2006 , the first of the two trains underwent testing at Bombardier 's manufacturing and test site at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby . It was due to be delivered to London Underground by the end of 2006 for testing on the Victoria line during engineering hours -LRB- times after the line stops carrying passengers and repair and testing work is carried out -RRB- , but this did not occur until May 2007 . It will also be used for driver and maintenance training and familiarisation . The first of the trains was expected to begin passenger service for the Victoria line for evaluation purposes in July 2008 , with the remainder of the fleet being delivered and entering passenger service in 2009 . However , by October 2007 the date for the first train entering service had been moved to January 2009 . The first train entered service on 21 July 2009 , leaving Northumberland Park depot at 23:00 and forming train 277 leaving Seven Sisters at 23:55 to Brixton .

A model organism is a non-human species that is studied over many years , building up a lot of knowledge about it .
The purpose is to understand fundamental biological phenomena . The hope is that discoveries made in the model will give insight into how other organisms work .
In particular , model organisms are widely used to explore potential causes and treatments for human disease when experimenting on humans would be impossible or less ethical .
This strategy is made possible by the common descent of all living organisms , and the conservation of metabolic and developmental pathways and genes over the course of evolution .
Drosophila melanogaster was among the first organisms used for genetic analysis , and today it is one of the most widely used and genetically best-known of all eukaryotic organisms .
All organisms use common genetic systems ; understanding transcription and replication in fruit flies helps in understanding these processes in other eukaryotes , including humans .
Studies of X-linked traits confirmed that genes are found on chromosomes . Studies of linked traits led to the first maps of genetic loci on chromosomes . The first maps of Drosophila chromosomes were done by Alfred Sturtevant .

Smokey Bear -LRB- also sometimes called Smokey the Bear -RRB- is a mascot of the United States Forest Service . He was made to teach people that forest fires are dangerous and how people can prevent . An advertising campaign featuring Smokey was started in 1944 with the slogan , `` Smokey Says â `` Care Will Prevent 9 out of 10 Forest Fires '' . Smokey Bear 's later slogan , `` Remember ... Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires '' , was made in 1947 by the Ad Council . In April 2001 , the message was changed to `` Only You Can Prevent Wildfires '' . According to the Ad Council , Smokey Bear and his message are recognized by 95 % of adults and 77 % of children in the U.S.
Smokey 's correct name is Smokey Bear . In 1952 , the songwriters Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins made a famous song named `` Smokey the Bear '' . The pair said that `` the '' was added to Smokey 's name to keep the song 's rhythm . This small change has made people confused ever since . Smokey 's name is spelled differently from the word smoky on purpose .
The fictional character Smokey Bear is run by three groups : the United States Forest Service , the National Association of State Foresters , and the Ad Council Smokey Bear 's name and image are protected by U.S. federal law , the Smokey Bear Act of 1952 -LRB- 16 U.S.C. 580 -LRB- p-2 -RRB- ; 18 U.S.C. 711 -RRB- .
Though the US Forest Service fought wildfires long before World War II , the war made doing it even more important . The forest service began using colorful posters to teach Americans about the dangers of forest fires . Since most physically fit men who were able to already were serving in the armed forces , there were few people who could stay back and put them out as a job . The hope was that local communities , educated about the danger of forest fires , could prevent them from starting in the first place . However , Japan saw wildfires as a possible weapon . Forest fires could waste the time of people in the United States who could otherwise be involved in the war . They could also destroy natural resources .
The government made advertisements about fire safety . It decided to use a bear in the advertisement . The bear was named `` Smokey '' after `` Smokey '' Joe Martin , a New York City Fire Department hero who suffered burns and blindness during a brave 1922 rescue .
Smokey 's first poster was released on August 9 , 1944 . It was drawn by Albert Staehle . In the poster , Smokey was wearing jeans and a `` forest ranger 's hat '' -LRB- a campaign hat -RRB- , pouring a bucket of water on a campfire . The message underneath reads , `` Smokey says â `` Care will prevent 9 out of 10 forest fires ! '' Knickerbocker Bears got a license to make Smokey bear dolls in 1944 . Also in 1944 , Forest Service worker Rudy Wendelin became the full time campaign artist ; he was considered Smokey Bear 's `` caretaker '' until he retired in 1973 .
In 1947 , the saying now associated with Smokey Bear was first said : `` Remember ... only YOU can prevent forest fires . ''
The living symbol of Smokey Bear was an American black bear who , in the spring of 1950 , was caught in the Capitan Gap fire , a wildfire that burned 17000 a in the Capitan Mountains of New Mexico . The cub was in the Lincoln National Forest . Smokey had climbed a tree to get away from the fire , but his paws and hind legs had been burned . He was rescued by a game warden after the fire .
At first , he was called `` Hotfoot Teddy , '' but he was later renamed Smokey , after the mascot . A local rancher who had been helping fight the fire took the cub home with him , but he needed care from a veterinarian . New Mexico Department of Game and Fish Ranger Ray Bell took him to Santa Fe . His wife , Ruth , and their children , Don and Judy , took care of the cub . News services around the country wrote stories about the cub , and he became famous . Soon after , Smokey was flown in a Piper Cub airplane to the National Zoo in Washington , D.C. , where he lived for 26 years . After he died on November 9 , 1976 , Smokey 's remains were returned by the government to Capitan , New Mexico , and buried at what is now the Smokey Bear Historical Park .
The character became a big part of American popular culture in the 1950s . He appeared on radio programs , in comic strips and in cartoons .
In 1952 , Congress passed the Smokey Bear Act , an act of Congress , was passed to remove the character from the public domain and place it under the control of the Secretary of Agriculture . This meant that people had to have permission from the government to use pictures of Smokey . The act -RRB-
In 2004 , Smokey 's 60th anniversary was celebrated . According to Richard Earle , author of The Art of Cause Marketing , the Smokey Bear campaign is recognized one of the most powerful and lasting of all public service advertising . `` Smokey is simple , strong , straightforward , '' Earle writes . `` He 's a denizen of those woods you 're visiting , and he cares about preserving them . Anyone who grew up watching Bambi realizes how terrifying a forest fire can be . But Smokey would n't run away . Smokey 's strong . He 'll stay and fight the fire if necessary , but he 'd rather have you douse it and cover it up so he does n't have to . ''
In 2009 , new commercials with Smokey made in CGI came out .

Hydrogen sulfide -LRB- hydrogen sulphide in British English -RRB- , H2S , is a colorless , toxic , flammable gas that is responsible for the foul smell of rotten eggs and flatulence . It often results when bacteria break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen . This happens in swamps , and sewers -LRB- alongside the process of anaerobic digestion -RRB- . It also occurs in volcanic gases , natural gas and some well waters . This is the smell that people often think to be that of sulfur . But sulfur itself does not smell .
Hydrogen sulfide is also known as sulfane , sulfur hydride , sour gas , sulfurated hydrogen , hydrosulfuric acid , sewer gas and stink damp . IUPAC accepts the names `` hydrogen sulfide '' and `` sulfane '' . When people speak of more complicated compounds they always use the term `` sulfane '' .
Small amounts of hydrogen sulfide can be found in crude petroleum but natural gas can contain up to 28 % . Volcanoes and hot springs emit some H2S , where it probably arises via the hydrolysis of sulfide minerals , i.e. MS + H2O to give MO + H2S .
Normal average concentration in clean air is about 0.0001-0 .0002 ppm .
Hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic and flammable gas . Because it is heavier than air it tends to accumulate at the bottom of poorly ventilated spaces .
Hydrogen sulfide is considered a broad-spectrum poison , meaning that it can poison several different systems in the body , although the nervous system is most affected . The toxicity of H2S is comparable with that of hydrogen cyanide .
Thanksgiving is a holiday in the USA and Canada when people give thanks . It is celebrated every year on the fourth Thursday of November in the USA and on the second Monday of October in Canada .
In 1863 , Abraham Lincoln set aside the last Thursday of November as a national Day of Thanksgiving . American immigrants brought the customs and practices of the American Thanksgiving to Canada , beginning on April 5 , 1872 . The United States Congress permanently established the fourth Thursday of each November as a national holiday in the year 1941 , and Canadian Parliament later established the second Monday of each October as a national holiday in the year 1957 .
Although not as famous , the first `` day of Thanksgiving '' actually took place at Berkeley Hundred , Virginia in 1619 - a year before the Mayflower brought the Pilgrims to Massachusetts .
The Pilgrims were early settlers on the east coast of North America . They traveled from England on a ship called the Mayflower and made their new home in what is now Plymouth , Massachusetts , 380 km northeast of what is now New York .
Many of the Pilgrims died during their first winter in North America . They were cold and did not have enough food . The following year , though , the Native Americans , who were from the Wampanoag tribe , helped them grow crops . At harvest time in the winter of 1621 , they were very thankful that they had a good crop of food to eat during the coming winter . They thanked God and the Wampanoags for teaching them how to grow crops .
They invited three of the Wampanoags who had helped them to their feast . They were Squanto , Samoset , and Chief Massasoit . The Wampanoags brought their families . This was over 90 people . There were so many people that the Pilgrims did not have enough food to make the meal , so the Wampanoags brought along their own food for the feast .
The Wampanoags brought turkey , duck , fish , deer , berries , squash , and cornbread . They also brought things that they had farmed and shown the Pilgrims how to care for .
The Thanksgiving holiday is a four-day holiday over the weekend . Families and friends usually eat a special meal together -LRB- usually with a turkey as the main dish -RRB- . This meal also usually includes mashed potatoes , cranberry sauce , pumpkin pie , several casseroles , and stuffing . This meal is made to remember a group of settlers called the Pilgrims , who came from England in 1620 to make a new life in North America . The food eaten today for Thanksgiving is very different from the food that was eaten at the First Thanksgiving in 1621 .
On television , there are parades and football games .
Dr. Joseph Goebbels -LRB- German pronunciation : -RRB- -LRB- 29 October 1897 in MÃ nchengladbach as Paul Joseph Goebbels â `` 1 May 1945 in Berlin -RRB- was a German politician and the minister of propaganda during the Nazi regime . He studied literature and philosophy at the Heidelberg university .
He was a close friend of Adolf Hitler . Goebbels stayed with Hitler in the FÃ 1\/4 hrerbunker until Hitler 's suicide on 30 April 1945 . After Hitler 's death , Goebbels was chancellor of Germany for one day , before he and his wife Magda Goebbels were killed by an SS officer , on Goebbels ' orders . Just before she died , Magda killed their six children with poison .
Joseph Goebbels was born as Paul Joseph Goebbels in MÃ nchengladbach on 29 October 1897 . His father , Friedrich Goebbels , was a bookkeeper and his mother was Maria Goebbels -LRB- born Oldenhausen -RRB- . He was the third child of the family and grew up with five siblings .

Parmigiana is a Southern Italian dish made with a shallow-fried sliced filling , with cheese and tomato sauce on top , then baked . Eggplant parmigiana is the earliest version . Other kinds made with breaded meat cutlets , such as veal and chicken parmigiana , are popular in other countries , usually in areas with a lot of Italian immigrants .
The dish is claimed by both Campania and Sicily . While `` parmigiana '' means `` from Parma '' -LRB- in Northern Italy -RRB- , the dish is not part of Parma food . It is based on melanzane alla parmigiana -LRB- alt . parmigiana di melanzane -RRB- or eggplant parmigiana -LRB- or eggplant Parmesan -RRB- , a classic Southern Italian dish .
Along with the many Italian versions , different kinds of Parmigiana have been developed across the world , most often in countries where large numbers of Italians immigrated . Examples of dishes developed outside of Italy from the early parmigianas include veal -LRB- Veal Parmigiana -RRB- or chicken breast -LRB- Chicken Parmigiana -RRB- dipped in beaten eggs , breaded , shallow-fried and topped with a marinara sauce -LRB- red Sicilian tomato sauce -RRB- and mozzarella . It is then usually baked until the cheese is bubbly and brown . The veal dish is known in Italian as Cotolette alla Bolognese .
Parmigiana is also used as an adjective in the names of other unrelated dishes from Parma food , such as Trippa alla Parmigiana -LRB- Parma-style tripe -RRB- .
The dish consists of a sliced filling pan fried in oil , layered with tomato sauce and cheese , and baked in an oven . In some kinds , the sliced filling is first dipped in beaten eggs and covered in flour or breadcrumbs before frying . Some recipes use hard grated cheeses such as Parmesan or Pecorino Romano , while others use softer melting cheeses like Mozzarella or Caciocavallo , or a combination of these .
In the United States and Canada , veal parmigiana or chicken parmigiana is commonly served as a grinder or a submarine sandwich . It is also popular with a side of or on top of pasta . Diced onions or green bell peppers , sautÃ ed or raw , are sometimes added .
Chicken or veal parmigiana has become very popular in Australia as a pub dish , often served with chips and salad . It may also contain a lot of toppings , including sliced ham or fried eggplant slices . This dish is often referred to as a parma or parmi , a simple shortening of the name .
A similar dish , the Parmo , which uses either pork or chicken , has been made within the country of England .
There are several theories for the origin of the name parmigiana .
One common theory says the name is from Parmigiano-Reggiano -LRB- Parmesan cheese -RRB- .
This is an ancient Sicilian dish which , in all cookbooks , is erroneously stated as obtaining its name from Parmesan cheese , which is one of the ingredients . Nothing could be further from the truth . The name `` parmigiana '' does not derive from that of the cheese but is the Italianization of the Sicilian dialectal word `` parmiciana '' , which refers to the slats of wood which compose the central part of a shutter and overlap in the same manner as the slices of eggplant in the dish . ''
As with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese , the word Parmigiana is often rendered as `` Parmesan '' in English-speaking countries , from the French word for `` from Parma . ''

The Spanish Conquest of YucatÃ n was the campaign undertaken by the Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Maya states . This part of the conquest and colonization of the Americas began in the early 16th century , but it took more time than the similar campaigns against the Aztec and Inca Empires . It was about 170 years later before the last Maya stronghold fell , that of the Itza capital of Tayasal on Lake PetÃ n ItzÃ , in 1697 . But except for the PetÃ n region and the Guatemalan highlands , the Spanish had control over YucatÃ n itself already by 1546 .
Unlike the campaigns against the Aztec and Inca states , the Maya had no single political center . Therefore the Spanish had to fight city by city to brake resistance by the indigenous peoples . In the beginning the conquistadores were mainly interested to get as much gold and silver as possible . Because the Maya lands were poor in this respect , they were not very interesting for the Spanish at that stage . But when land workers became important for the colonies , the Spanish turned to the Maya region . That was around the 1520s .

The Childrenâ s Hearing System in Scotland is unique . It takes into account the fact that children who offend need the same sort of care as those who are victims of offence . Only if a child has committed a serious crime will they be trialled in a normal court . For most cases they are sent to a childrenâ s panel . On the panel there are 3 adults of whom there must be at least one member of each sex , and the childâ s parent or guardian will also be present .
The meeting is usually done sitting round a table . The Panel members are given information and reports and the childâ s circumstances are fully discussed before reaching a decision . Itâ s unlike a regular hearing as well in the fact that the child can speak at any time during the meeting .
A child may be sent to a childrenâ s court because they had committed a crime , or because they had been neglected or were not attending school . Often , a childrenâ s reporter will refer a child to a panel . These reporters gather information on a child from teachers , social workers , or police and decide whether or not to refer them to a panel . A childrenâ s reporter will be made aware of a vulnerable child by a referral . A referral is a notification from anyone -LRB- neighbor , teacher , police -RRB- about a child they think needs legal intervention .

However they can not inflict a fine upon a child or their parents .

Scandinavia is a region in northern Europe , that includes Norway , Sweden and Denmark . `` Scandinavia '' is more useful as a linguistic term , rather than geographic , however , because it also refers to the area where Scandinavian languages -LRB- North Germanic languages -RRB- are spoken . The Scandinavian languages -LRB- Swedish , Norwegian , Danish , Icelandic and Faroese -RRB- are closely related , and many Scandinavians are able to understand some of the other languages , though with difficulty .
The Scandinavian Peninsula is a large peninsula reaching west from northern Europe over the north side of the Baltic Sea . Norway , Sweden and some of Finland are on the peninsula , also known as Fennoscandia . Denmark , not Finland , however , is regarded as part of Scandinavia . This is because Danish is a Scandinavian language but Finnish is not . Iceland and the Faroe Islands are sometimes included in `` Scandinavia '' for the same reason .
The term Nordic countries is sometimes used as a more precise geographical term , but the Nordic countries include Norway , Sweden , Denmark -LRB- including the Faroe Islands -RRB- , Finland and Iceland . These five countries coordinate political and cultural activities through the Nordic Council . Denmark , Sweden and Finland are also members of the European Union , but only Finland uses the euro , while the other Nordic countries still use their own currency , each called krone or krona -LRB- `` crowns '' -RRB- . Norway and Iceland , which are not members of the EU , are members of NATO . Only Denmark is a member of both the EU and NATO .
The Scandinavian Peninsula is sparsely populated and covered with large forests of pine , birch , and spruce . The western and northern parts are mountainous ; the Scandinavian mountains are some of the oldest in the world . The tallest mountain is GaldhÃ piggen in Norway . Denmark -LRB- 43,098 km2 -RRB- is the smallest of the Scandinavian countries . It is more densely populated , and most of the land is farmland . Sweden -LRB- 449,964 km2 -RRB- is the largest of the Scandinavian countries . It has the most lakes , and the landscape ranges from plains in the south to mountains in the west -LRB- along the border with Norway -RRB- to tundra in the north . The far north of Scandinavia and Finland is called Lapland , where the Sami people live . Some of them still herd reindeer as they have for centuries , but the Sami mostly live in a modernized society equal to that of other Scandinavians .
The best-known stereotypes of Scandinavian people relate to the Vikings of the Middle Ages . The Vikings from Sweden are best known as traders , traveling as far as modern Ukraine and establishing trade routes to bring goods from the Middle East to Scandinavia . The Vikings from Norway are best known as explorers , crossing the North Atlantic in their longships and settling Iceland and Greenland . The Norwegian explorers even reached the east coast of modern Canada where they set up a colony , but it only lasted a few years . The Vikings from Denmark , however , left the biggest mark on the English . The Danish raiders attacked England repeatedly and brutally , demanding Ransom that came to be called `` Danegeld '' , and prompting the Clergy of churches along the east coast of England to offer the desperate and often repeated prayer , `` deliver us , O Lord , from the wrath of the Norsemen ! '' But the modern stereotypes of the Vikings actually were invented much later , in the 19th century , when Richard Wagner and others of the Romantic period romanticised ancient Germanic culture in the opera and the other arts , often showing Vikings wearing furs and winged or horned helmets and drinking from large horns .

Less expensive inkjet printers , which cost a little more than 100 US dollars , are a bargain for users who want to be able to print pages in color .
Endorphins are proteins that are similar to opioids . They are made by the endocrine system of many vertebrates . When they are released into the body , they cause a sense of well-being . They also act as analgesics -- that is , they can fight pain . They are sometimes named `` natural pain killers '' . Endorphins were first found in 1970s . In 1977 , Roger Guillemin and Andrew W. Schally won the Nobel Prize in medicine because of their studies on hormones in the brain , including endorphins .
The term endorphin is a general name for many opioid-like proteins . -LRB- It consists of two parts : endo and orphin ; these are short forms of the words endogenous metersorphine which means `` a morphin-like substance which is produced by the human body '' . -RRB- Special endorphins have their own names , like enkephalin and Î - endorphin .
Four types of endorphins are created in the human body . They are named alpha -LRB- Î -RRB- , beta -LRB- Î -RRB- , gamma -LRB- Î -RRB- and sigma -LRB- Ï -RRB- endorphins . The four types have different numbers and types of amino acids in their molecules ; they have between 16 and 31 amino acids in each molecule .
Beta-endorphins -LRB- Î - endorphins -RRB- are the most powerful endorphins in the body . They are usually found in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland . More endorphins are released in the pituitary gland during times of pain or stress . Exercise increases the endorphin release too . For the same reason , exercise results in a better mood .
Met-enkephalin and leu-enkephalin are found in the brain stem and spinal cord ; they are the pain killers of the spinal cord . Both of them have five amino acids in their structure ; the first four are similar , but the last one is different .
All of the endorphins bind to the opioid receptors in the brain . Many of the analgesic -LRB- pain killer -RRB- drugs have a similar action in the brain . The main difference between the natural endorphins and the analgesic drugs is that natural endorphins are cleared from the blood very quickly . Endorphins are also involved in the release of sex hormones in the pituitary gland . Also , scientists think that acupuncture results in the release of more endorphins . Endorphins may have a role in obesity , diabetes and psychiatric diseases too .
The term endorphin rush is sometimes used in normal speech to refer to a feeling of wellness caused by exercise , danger or stress . However , it is not a medical term , and it is not proven that higher endorphin production after exercise really has a role in the wellness feeling .
Another term which is commonly used is runner 's high . It refers to the feeling being `` high '' -LRB- full of energy and wellness -RRB- after exercise . It is commonly said that the `` high '' is a result of the release of bigger amounts of endorphins in the body during the exercise . However , some scientists think this feeling is caused by the challenge , and is not related to endorphin release .
For example , in some studies a drug was given to people which blocked the effect of endorphins . These people still felt the runner 's high ; it means this feeling is not caused by the release of endorphins in the blood . Another study was performed in 2004 , which showed this feeling is related to a different body chemical named `` anadamide '' . Anadamide is similar to one of the chemicals which is found in marijuana . The body produces anadamide to fight with the stress and pain in a long exercise .
The Lower East Side is a neighborhood in southeastern part of the New York City borough of Manhattan . The neighborhood is roughly made up of Allen Street , East Houston Street , Essex Street , Canal Street , Eldridge Street , East Broadway , and Grand Street . It is considered to be an immigrant , working class area , but some parts of the neighborhood have been bought , repaired , destroyed , and renovated in recent years . Because of this , The National Trust for Historic Preservation put Lower East Side Manhattan on their list of America 's Most Endangered Places At one time , much of the Lower East Side was tenements or slums , but many of these have been torn down or replaced by housing projects . During the late 19th and early 20th century , almost a million people lived on the Lower East Side , making it one of the most densely populated places on the planet . In the early to mid-19th century , many of the people were from Ireland and Germany . In the late 19th and early 20th century , many of the people there were from Eastern Europe , including many Jews . Today , many of the immigrants in the Lower East Side are from the Dominican Republic and China .

A chosen-plaintext attack -LRB- CPA -RRB- is an attack model for cryptanalysis which assume that the attacker has the capability to choose random plaintexts to be encrypted and obtain the corresponding ciphertexts . The goal of the attack is to gain some further information which reduces the security of the encryption scheme . In the worst case , a chosen-plaintext attack could expose secret information after calculating the secret key .
Modern cryptography , is implemented in software or hardware and is used for a diverse range of applications ; for many applications , a chosen-plaintext attack is often very feasible . Chosen-plaintext attacks become extremely important in the context of public key cryptography , where the encryption key is public and attackers can encrypt any plaintext they choose .
Any cipher that can prevent chosen-plaintext attacks is then also guaranteed to be secure against known-plaintext and ciphertext-only attacks ; this is a conservative approach to security .

In baseball , a stolen base is when a baserunner advances to the next base while the pitcher is throwing the ball to home plate . In baseball statistics , stolen bases are displayed as SB . It is possible to steal second base , third base , or home plate , but not to steal first base .
If the defense does not try to put the baserunner out -LRB- for example , if the catcher does not even look his way -RRB- , the play is called defensive indifference -LRB- also called fielder 's indifference -RRB- . No stolen base is credited to the runner in this case . Defensive indifference is usually only scored instead of a stolen base when the game is in a late inning and the team with the stealing baserunner is down by more than one run . MLB Rule 10.07 -LRB- g -RRB- defines defensive indifference .
A player who is good at stealing bases needs not just running speed , but also good base-running instincts , quickness , and split-second timing . The scoring and guidelines for awarding a stolen base to a runner are covered by rule 10.07 of the Major League Baseball rule book .
If a player is good at stealing bases , his manager may let him try to steal a base whenever he thinks he can . A player who is allowed to try to steal whenever he wants is said to have the `` green light '' . Players who do not have the green light may only be allowed to steal when a coach or manager tells him to .

The Maya civilization was a large , loosely organized group of people who lived in Central America . It is famous now because the Maya people long ago knew a lot about writing , art , mathematics , star systems and calendars . The Maya knew more about these things than most other Central American civilizations of the time .
The Maya civilization began around the year 2000 BC -LRB- about 4000 years ago -RRB- and continued until Spanish invaders arrived in the 15th and 16th centuries AD . It was at its strongest and most advanced between 250 AD and 900 AD . This is called the Classic period .
The Maya civilization was similar to most other civilizations that existed at the same time in the region . The Maya did not invent writing or the calendar , but they developed these systems more than the other civilizations around them . Some of the things the Maya did changed the way other people did the same things , even as far away as central Mexico which is more than km -LRB- 625 miles -RRB- from where the Maya lived . Many things from other places also influenced Maya art and buildings . The Maya also revolutionized the way we keep time with the Mayan Calendar .
The Maya peoples never disappeared . There was a time called the Classic period declination . In this time lots of other civilizations disappeared but the Maya civilization did not disappear . Spain sent out conquistadores who tried to take over other civilizations around the same area as the Maya Civilization . The Maya Civilization did not get taken over by these people .
Today , the Maya and their descendants are a big part of the population in the Maya area . They still have many of the same traditions and beliefs that the Maya from classic times had . Most people believe in the religion of Roman Catholicism brought to Maya by the conquistadores . Lots of different Mayan languages are still used as people 's first language today . The Rabinal AchÃ is a play written in the Q ` eqchi ' language . It was declared a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity -LRB- an important part of the world 's history -RRB- by UNESCO in 2005 .
The Maya civilization was from the northern Central American region . It included some of the places that are now known as Guatemala , Belize , western Honduras and El Salvador , as well as the southern Mexican states of Chiapas , Tabasco , and the YucatÃ n Peninsula states of Quintana Roo , Campeche and YucatÃ n.
This was a very large region that had lots of different types of land , such as the Sierra Madre mountains and the semi-arid -LRB- slightly dry -RRB- plains of northern YucatÃ n. The weather in the region changes lots . This was because it has low level land areas that are affected by hurricanes and tropical storms of the Caribbean .
The area is normally divided into three parts : the southern Maya highlands , the southern -LRB- or central -RRB- Maya lowlands , and the northern Maya lowlands .
People have lived in the Mayan region since the 10th millennium BC . The first Maya settlements started about 1800 BC , in the Soconusco region . This is in the modern-day state of Chiapas in Mexico , on the Pacific Ocean . Today , this is called the Early Preclassic period in Mayan history . At this time , humans began to settle down permanently . They started to farm animals . Pottery and small clay figures were made . They made simple burial mounds . Later they developed these mounds into step pyramids . There were other civilizations around , especially in the north . Examples are the Olmec , the Mixe-Zoque , and Zapotec civilizations . These people mostly lived in the area of the modern-day state Oaxaca . The exact borders of the Maya empire in the north are unclear . There were probably areas where Maya culture overlapped with other culures . Many of the earliest significant inscriptions and buildings appeared in this overlapping zone . These cultures and the Maya probably influenced one another .
What is known as the classical period lasted from about 250 to about 909 . During this time , many monuments were constructed . There are also many big inscriptions -LRB- carvings -RRB- during that time . In it , the Maya moved to building large cities . This is known as urbanism . Many important intellectual and artistic developments happened in an area that is known as the southern lowlands .
Like with the Ancient Greek their civilization was made of many independent city-states -LRB- cities that made their own rules -RRB- . Intensive agriculture was done around these city states . Well-known cities were Tikal , Palenque , CopÃ n and Calakmul . Lesser-known cities were Dos Pilas , Uaxactun , Altun Ha , and Bonampak , among others . In general , the city distribution in the south is better known than that in the north . Some known population centers in the north were Oxkintok , Chunchucmil , and the early occupation of Uxmal .
The most notable monuments are the pyramids they built in their religious centers and the palaces of their leaders . The palace at CancuÃ n is the largest in the Maya area . There are no pyramids near the palace . The Maya also made carved stone slabs usually called stelae -LRB- the Maya called them tetun , or `` tree-stones '' -RRB- . These slabs show rulers along with hieroglyphic texts -LRB- a type of writing -RRB- describing their genealogy , military victories , and other things that they did successfully .
The Maya also had trade routes that ran over long distances . They traded with many of the other Mesoamerican cultures , such as Teotihuacan , the Zapotec , and other groups in central and gulf-coast Mexico . They also traded with non-Meosoamerican groups that were farther away . For example , archaeologists -LRB- people who study ancient things -RRB- found gold from Panama in the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza .
Important trade goods were cacao , salt , sea shells , jade and obsidian .
In the north , development went on , from the 10th to about the 16th century . The influences from the outside left more traces in the Maya culture at that time . Some of the important sites in this era were Chichen Itza , Uxmal , EdznÃ , and Coba . At some point , the ruling dynasties of Chichen and Uxmal declined . Afterwards , Mayapan ruled all of YucatÃ n until a revolt in 1450 . The area then broke up into competing city-states until the YucatÃ n was conquered by the Spanish .
The maya Itza , Ko ` woj , and Yalain groups of Central Peten survived the `` Classic Period Collapse '' in small numbers . By 1250 , they started to form competing city-states . The Itza maintained their capital at Tayasal -LRB- also known as Noh PetÃ n -RRB- . The remains of this city are thought to be below the modern city of Flores , Guatemala on Lake PetÃ n ItzÃ . Tayasal ruled over an area extending across the Peten Lakes region , encompassing the community of Eckixil on Lake Quexil . The Ko ` woj had their capital at Zacpeten . Postclassic Maya states also continued to survive in the southern highlands . One of the Maya kingdoms in this area , the QuichÃ , is responsible for the best-known Maya work of historiography and mythology , the Popol Vuh .
The Spanish started to conquer Maya lands . This took them much longer than with the Inca or Aztecs , because the Mayans had no capital city . This meant that when the Spanish had conquered one city , this had little influence on the whole empire . The last Maya states , the Itza city of Tayasal and the Ko ` woj city of Zacpeten , were continuously occupied . They remained independent of the Spanish until late in the 17th century . They were finally conquered in 1697 .
The Maya people did not disappear though . There are still about 6 million of them . Some are well-integrated , others keep more traditions from older times .

Wikipedia is not working to a deadline . A small number of articles might make Wikipedia 1.0 , but the vast majority will not and for the balance there is no deadline . There are two points of view on what this lack of a deadline means .
We can afford to take our time , to consider matters , to wait before creating a new article until its significance is unambiguously established .
Wikipedia is not Wikinews and has no need to scoop anyone . Turn this into a strength by working on your article in your userspace or scratchpad until you have the best possible article , fully referenced , a masterpiece of neutrality . And if someone beats you to it , makes that first place in the edit history , so what ? Merge in what you have and turn a stub or whatever into a good article . Wikipedia is not a competition either .
Above all , creating an article without establishing the basis of the content and its significance is a bad idea . There really are no points for being first ; being the author of the best and most neutral content will earn you far greater kudos .
We can afford to take our time to improve articles , to wait before deleting a new article until its lack of significance is unambiguously established .
Wikipedia is not paper and has no need to work towards a deadline . There is no finished version expected soon , and it is perfectly acceptable to let the editing process fashion an article up to our standards eventually . And if it takes a long time for that process to work , so what ? Wikipedia is a work in progress , and will always remain so . There is no publication date and Wikipedia does not have to be finished today . It merely needs to have improved on yesterday . Perfection is neither desired nor achievable .
Above all , creating an article which is unfinished is the -LRB- second rule -RRB- of Wikipedia . That way you encourage other people to contribute ; collaborating will earn you far greater respect .

Ian Stevenson , M.D. , was a Canadian professor of psychiatry . He worked at the University of Virginia , in the area of parapsychology .
Stevenson thought that the idea of reincarnation might help modern medicine better understand aspects of human behavior and development . He traveled a lot over a period of 40 years to investigate 3,000 childhood cases that suggested to him the possibility of past lives . Stevenson saw reincarnation as the survival of the personality after death , although he never suggested a physical process by which a personality might survive death .
Stevenson 's research was the subject of Jim B. Tucker 's Life Before Life -LRB- 2005 -RRB- .
Stevenson found that the best evidence supporting the belief in reincarnation comes from the cases of young children who , typically between the ages of 2 and 5 , make statements about a previous life they claim to have had before being born . Their statements are often accompanied by behavior that is unusual for their family but appropriate for the life that the child claims to remember . There is often a `` forgetting of the imaged memories between the ages of 5 and 8 ; a high incidence of violent death claimed in the claimed previous life ; and mention of the mode of death by the subject '' .
Some 35 per cent of the subjects have birthmarks or birth defects which often correspond to injuries or illness experienced by the deceased person who the subject remembers . Medical documents have confirmed this correspondence in more than forty cases .
Ian Stevenson authored or co-authored more than a dozen books . Stevenson died in 2007 , and many of these books are mentioned in his obituaries in the British Medical Journal , New York Times , and the Washington Post .

Their daughter , named Chibiusa -LRB- Rini in the English version -RRB- , travels through time to help them and the Sailor Senshi .
Usagi has a cat named Luna . The cat is named Luna because `` luna '' is the Latin word for moon . Minako has a cat named Artemis after the Greek goddess of the moon -LRB- although Artemis is a male cat -RRB- . Luna and Artemis are not ordinary cats . They can talk , and they have moon symbols on their foreheads . They can also turn into humans in the manga , and Luna turns into a human in one of the anime movies . In the future , they have a kitten named Diana -LRB- Diana is the name of the Roman moon goddess -RRB- .
Later there are some other Sailor Senshi . They are named after the planets Saturn , Uranus , Neptune , and Pluto -LRB- now a dwarf planet -RRB- . Sailor Saturn 's real name is Hotaru Tomoe . Sailor Uranus ' real name is Haruka Tenoh -LRB- Amara in English -RRB- . Sailor Neptune 's real name is Michiru Kaioh -LRB- Michelle in English -RRB- . Sailor Pluto 's real name is Setsuna Meioh -LRB- Trista in English -RRB- . In the manga and the Japanese anime , Haruka and Michiru are lesbians , but in the English anime they were changed to cousins . This is because the English anime was made for younger children than the Japanese anime .
Each Sailor Senshi has different powers . Sailor Moon has powers of love and healing . Sailor Mercury has powers of water . Sailor Mars has fire powers , Sailor Jupiter has electricity and plant powers , and Sailor Venus has light and energy powers . Sailor Chibi Moon , -LRB- called Sailor Mini Moon in the English version -RRB- has love and sugar powers . Sailor Saturn is death and rebirth , Sailor Neptune is water , Sailor Uranus is earthquakes , and Sailor Pluto has time and death powers . Tuxedo Mask can throw sharp rose darts at the enemies .
In the manga there are five series : Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon , Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R -LRB- eturn\/omance -RRB- , Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Stars . Sailor Moon was originally serialized in the Japanese manga magazine by Kodansha . Afterwards Kodansha published the completed series in volumes . There are eighteen volumes total .
The anime stayed close to the story from the manga . However due to its popularity , Toei made more seasons and produced movies . Sailor moon was licensed to be aired in the United States by DIC Entertainment -LRB- a company that makes tv and film -RRB- . DIC cut out some scenes and changed some of the dialogue to make it more acceptable for children . Many anime fans in the US did not like the changes . Due to their complaints , ADV Films and later Pioneer Inc. made uncut versions .

K2 is the second highest mountain in the world . It is in the Karakoram section of the Himalayas between Pakistan and Chinaand it is the National mountain of Pakistan . The name K2 is derieved from the name of mountain range Karakoram . This is how the mountain is popluarly known as K2 . K2 means Karakoram 2 . The mountain is 8,623 metres -LRB- 28,661 feet -RRB- high . It is believed that the mountain is harder to climb than Mount Everest because of its very bad weather . It is said by the climbers that the weather around K2 is 10 times worse means Colder or Freezing than Mount Everest . K2 is also much higher than the area around it when compared to Everest . K2 is nicknamed `` The Savage Mountain '' because of this . As of 2004 , only 246 people have climbed to the top of the mountain . At least 56 people have died trying to climb it . An unofficial name for K2 is Mount Godwin Austen , named for the man who first climbed it .

This essay , WP : Avoiding Wikipedia quirks , is intended to try to explain what is happening , hourly , to the Wikipedia system , and to suggest work-around solutions . Everything is changing , without warning , and lots of it is quirky . There are hundreds of unusual , or unexpected quirks or glitches in the way things sort-of-do , sort-of-don ' t work . On any given day , new problems might arise , or old problems get fixed , as the developers adjust the servers or hack the MediaWiki code to alter character-shift typesetting for the 200 + Wikipedia languages -LRB- see below : Why quirks occur -RRB- .
Not all problems are caused by Wikipedia 's software configuration . Many problems are actually from each user 's PC setup or browser , such as pressing F5 or -LRB- before edit-preview -RRB- and losing all edit-text -LRB- see below : Browser nightmares -RRB- . Also , Wikipedia is not alone in having website quirks , even Google has had them -LRB- see section below : `` Google quirks '' -RRB- .
The MediaWiki markup language is a peculiar twisto-mash of 3 computer languages . The most normal language is the typical free-flowing text that allows triple-quote ` bold-font ' , along with the HTML tags , such as . However , along with that stuff , there is a 2nd language as wikitable codes -LRB- in Table -RRB- , so that a table begins with '' '' which formerly were required in column 1 but can be indented now -LRB- at least sometimes , or maybe not whatever -RRB- . Then there is the 3rd language : the `` infamous '' if-you-indent , you get `` quotebox '' yes the all-important quotebox , which in computer-typesetting typically requires only 2 markers ; instead , just indent and the whole section turns into quotebox â `` quotebox â `` quotebox . Ah so , oh-so-important quotebox he look like : Me is quotebox â `` I so cool , so important . Me is quotebox â `` wiki would die without me . Me is quotebox â `` I exist here 8 years plus forever . So , anyway , put all 3 schidzo languages , blended together , and you get MediaWiki markup -LRB- or markdown ? -RRB- language , affectionately known as `` wikipuke '' . Well , as can be expected with multiple personality disorder -LRB- MPD -RRB- , the 3 languages fight for power : when HTML code is formatted with typical indentation , the me-is-quotebox personality , at times , hijacks the page , and you get hypertext-markup-laughter displayed in a box that looks like -LRB- ... wait for it ... -RRB- a QuoteBox !
Kids do n't do this . Do n't design coding as quotebox .
The above text , with the multi-line footnote shows use of 4 HTML comment lines '' '' to simulate indenting by putting each text segment on a separate line .
In the first use of `` Mytemplate '' , the value of param1 can be considered to be `` xxx '' because the coding was split , with param2 -LRB- value `` yyy '' -RRB- on the 2nd line . In the second use of `` Mytemplate '' , the value of param1 is only `` aaa '' because the vertical-bar -LRB- or pipe -RRB- '' '' stopped param1 from including the line-break newline . When the template begins to process `` xxx '' then the newline might be seen as an indentation , within the template , so the template would start considering all subsequent lines to be part of the oh-so-important quotebox , generated now in the middle of the template procedural coding . Surprise !
Well , perhaps the users and article editors might find the coding steps somewhat annoying , adding the '' '' bar , just to avoid producing quoteboxes . However , imagine the stress on the Wikipedia developers , having to ensure that any changes or enhancements , to the MediaWiki interfaces , must continue to work as before , generating the same demented , peculiar sets of quotebox indentations , everywhere they had popped up before .
Many problems that users think are caused by Wikipedia are actually caused by limited Web browsers . For example , in some mainsteam browsers :
All of those problems are caused by quirky browser operation -LRB- not Wikipedia -RRB- , as the browser does not reflect the way that people actually think . In advanced software design , users would be allowed to set preferences for text-wrapping , cursor-movement , cursor-shape , etc. . Those preferences could be set to overcome some design flaws in the basic design of a system -LRB- such as a browser -RRB- , until the more normal settings are preset as the defaults in later software versions .
The exact causes , behind each quirk , are perhaps too complex to explain in this essay . However , some general principles can explain how the problems have arisen , over the years .
Wikipedia 's underlying software system , with the MediaWiki markup language , is constantly being changed to fix old problems and try to offer new , better features , but better for whom ? Many changes are made to support the unusual typesetting needs of rare written languages that use split-character placement of text or other unusual options not seen in English or other European languages . The English Wikipedia is impacted because all 200 + languages share some common software , and that software gets changed for everyone .
Sometimes -LRB- or often ? -RRB- , some really bizarre features are added , such as allowing wiki-templates to pass newlines at the end of parameter values , simply by indenting the next line , when calling a template . Normally , bizarre features would be designed to require special coding to trigger those features , such as : if you want to pass newlines in parameter values , then specify them , explicitly , such as `` param = aa # nuline ; bb # nuline ; cc # nuline ; '' where the code '' # nuline ; '' or '' '' -LRB- or some other invented thing -RRB- is the feature to be requested . Unfortunately , `` one man 's bizarreness is other man 's ordinary dork-otopia '' and some developers think that everyone should change their ways to adjust to the new stuff . Overly often , peculiar ideas are treated as mainstream `` everyone-should-know-nerdisms '' which become some of the widespread quirks that appear , from day to day .
Complicating the complications is the reality that , eventually , several multiple nerdisms are implemented . Rather than maintaining some basic , core levels of simplicity , the multiple nerdisms start interfering with earlier peculiar features , and the result becomes conflicting nerdisms with almost unpredictable , expanding quirks . Even the most level-headed , otherwise-normal software developers will become overwhelmed by the pre-exising nerdisms , so that even simple changes can introduce new quirks , and hence , no single group of people can be blamed for the combined , bizarre outcomes . Far surpassing `` creeping featurism '' the total system becomes `` featured creepyism '' .
By considering the design flaws , and the operational instability , it is possible to get a better understanding of the psychological pressures that people face when using Wikipedia . Knowing the details , about specific quirks , can help avoid the stress or frustrations in the future .
Wikipedia is not alone in having many website quirks . Even Google Inc. , with all the $ billions , has had some very unusual things happening in the official websites -LRB- for years -RRB- :
So even an organization with $ billions of revenue can not seem to avoid utterly spastic , peculiar quirks in their webpages . Perhaps the world is seeing a rapid growth in the rise of `` nerdnology '' as typical notions of quality control have been abandoned , almost everywhere . No longer are major changes tested on a sample user-group , but instead , released untested to the entire world . The quirks are not merely planned obsolescence , similar to allowing computer viruses , which are known to kill user computers and cause people to buy new or fix-it software products -LRB- as the planned result -RRB- . Instead , the quirks are not the work of college-dropout billionaires , but rather just a collection of misdirected changes .

The Komodo National Park is a national park in Indonesia . It is on several islands in the Lesser Sunda Islands . The park is in the area between the East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara provinces . The park includes three larger islands : Komodo , Padar and Rincah . It also includes 26 smaller ones for a total area of 1,733 kmÂ -LRB- 603 kmÂ of it land -RRB- . The national park was founded in 1980 to protect the Komodo dragon . This animal is the world 's largest lizard . Later it began protecting other species , including some in the ocean . In 1991 the national park was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site .
The park is spread over several islands . It includes part of western coast of Flores , the three larger islands of Komodo , Padar , Rincah , and 26 smaller islands . It also includes ocean areas such as the Sape Straights . The islands of the national park are volcanic . The land is generally rugged , with some rounded hills to 735m . The climate is one of the driest of Indonesia . Each year between 800mm and 1000mm of rain falls in the park area . Temperatures in the dry season from May to October are around 40 Â C.
The Park is hot and dry . There are many savannah plants that make it a good place for the Komodo dragon .
Cloud forests are in only a few areas above 500 metres . These forests are good places for some local plants . There are mangrove forests in some of the quiet bays of the three larger islands .
Large and complex coral reefs are along the north-east coast of Komodo . The park has many animals that live in the ocean , including whale sharks , ocean sunfish , manta rays , eagle rays , pygmy seahorse , false pipefish , clown frogfish , nudibranchs , blue-ringed octopus , sponges , tunicates , and coral .
The island of Padar and part of Rinca were made nature reserves in 1938 . Komodo Island became a nature reserve in 1965 . UNESCO also began to protect the island in 1977 . The three islands were named a national park in 1980 , . The park was extended to include the nearby parts of the ocean and a part of Flores in 1984 . In 1991 the national park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Since 1995 , the national park authority has been supported by an American environmental organization called The Nature Conservancy -LRB- TNC -RRB- .
Komodo National Park has been selected as one of 28 finalists to become one of the New7Wonders of Nature .
About 4,000 people live within the park . Scuba diving is popular because of the many different kinds of life living in the water . Ecotourism in the ocean is the main way to get money to support the park
However , several fishermen died since the 1980s . People disagree about what happened to them . Park patrol and military said they needed to protect themselves . Fishermen living in the area say the park management killed the fishermen on purpose . .

Malta , in particular , still speaks a language based on its own Maghrebi Arabic variety : Maltese .
The Meet-in-the-middle attack is a cryptographic attack which , like the birthday attack , makes use of a space-time tradeoff . While the birthday attack attempts to find two values in the domain of a function that map to the same value in its range , the meet-in-the-middle attack attempts to find a value in each of the ranges and domains of the composition of two functions such that the forward mapping of one through the first function is the same as the inverse image of the other through the second function -- quite literally meeting in the middle of the composed function .
It was first developed as an attack on an attempted expansion of a block cipher by Diffie and Hellman in 1977 . When trying to improve the security of a block cipher , one might get the idea to simply use two independent keys to encrypt the data twice and think that this would square the security of the double-encryption scheme . Certainly , an exhaustive search of all possible combination of keys would take attempts if each key is n bits long , compared to the attempts required for a single key . However , Diffie and Hellman , discovered a time-memory tradeoff that could break the scheme in only double the time to break the single-encryption scheme . The attack works by encrypting from one end and decrypting from the other end , thus meeting in the middle .
Assume the attacker knows a set of plaintext and ciphertext : P and C. That is , , where E is the encryption function -LRB- cipher -RRB- , and K1 and K2 are the two keys .
The attacker can then compute EK -LRB- P -RRB- for all possible keys K and store the results in memory . Afterwards he can decrypt the ciphertext by computing DK -LRB- C -RRB- for each K. Any matches between these two resulting sets are likely to reveal the correct keys . -LRB- To speed up the comparison , the EK -LRB- P -RRB- set is stored in an in-memory lookup table , then each DK -LRB- C -RRB- can be matched against the values in the lookup table to find the candidate keys . -RRB-
Once the matches are discovered , they can be verified with a second test-set of plaintext and ciphertext . If the keysize is n , this attack uses only encryptions -LRB- and space -RRB- in contrast to the naive attack , which needs encryptions -LRB- but only space -RRB- .
Applied mechanics , also known as theoretical and applied mechanics , is a branch of the physical sciences and the practical application of mechanics . Applied mechanics examines the response of bodies -LRB- solids and fluids -RRB- to external forces . Some examples of mechanical systems include the flow of a liquid under pressure , the fracture of a solid from an applied force , or the vibration of an ear in response to sound . A practitioner of the discipline is known as a mechanician .
Applied mechanics , as its name suggests , bridges the gap between physical theory and its application to technology .

A boomerang is a flying tool that is best known for its ability to return to the thrower . It used to be made of wood , but most of the modern boomerangs are made of other materials .
Most people know that Australian Aborigines used boomerangs for hunting . But the oldest boomerang was found in a cave in Poland and is more than 20,000 -LRB- twenty thousand -RRB- years old . This kind of boomerang do not return to the thrower , but they can fly longer distances and more stably than other things which can be thrown . These days -LRB- returning -RRB- boomerangs are usually used for recreation .
Most of the boomerangs do not have the classical `` L '' - shape . The modern boomerang is special in that it will return to the one who threw it , if it is thrown correctly . However , some boomerangs do not return because their wings do not have the right profile . Most of the boomerangs are made for right-handed use , left-handed people have to use other boomerangs that are mirror-inverted or have to throw with their right hand .
A boomerang is not thrown like a frisbee . It has to be thrown almost vertically , with an inclination of about 10-20 degrees and with a lot of rotation -LRB- spin -RRB- . When facing the wind , throw with an angle of 30-45 degrees to the right -LRB- left-handed : to the left -RRB- of the wind . Be sure to choose a field that is big enough , watch out for passers-by and do not throw when people are standing in the range of the boomerang . See also the link provided in the section below .
There are a lot of boomerang clubs in many countries all over the world . These clubs organise workshops and tournaments . The best boomerang-throwers come from Australia , France , Germany , Japan , Switzerland and the United States of America . A few years ago , the International Federation of Boomerang Associations -LRB- IFBA -RRB- was founded to help to spread knowledge about boomerangs .

Macroeconomics studies the economic decisions of a large group of people ; for example , a whole country 's economy . Many governments use macroeconomics to decide how much tax to collect , and what interest rates should be .
Macroeconomics also looks at exchange rates . For example , if a country has a high exchange rate , not many people will want to buy its expensive products . So the demand will be lower , and so will the prices .
The Alps is the greatest mountain range of Europe . It reaches from Austria and Slovenia in the east ; through Italy , Switzerland , Liechtenstein and Germany ; to France in the west . The original meaning of the word was ` white ' .

The mountains are divided into the Western Alps and the Eastern Alps . The division is along the line between Lake Constance and Lake Como , following the Rhine . The Western Alps are higher , but their central chain is shorter and curved ; they are located in Italy , France and Switzerland .
The Eastern Alps -LRB- main ridge system elongated and broad -RRB- belong to Austria , Germany , Italy , Liechtenstein , Slovenia and Switzerland . The highest peaks of the Western Alps are Mont Blanc , 4,808 metres -LRB- 15,774 ft -RRB- , Mont Blanc de Courmayeur 4,748 metres -LRB- 15,577 ft -RRB- , the Dufourspitze 4,634 metres -LRB- 15,203 ft -RRB- and the other summits of the Monte Rosa group , and the Dom , 4,545 metres -LRB- 14,911 ft -RRB- . The highest peak in the Eastern Alps is Piz Bernina , 4,049 metres -LRB- 13,284 ft -RRB- . Perhaps the most famous location for tourist to the Alps are the Swiss Alps .
The main chain of the Alps follows the watershed from the Mediterranean Sea to the Wienerwald , defining the northern border of Italy . It then passes over many of the highest and most famous peaks in the Alps . From the Colle di Cadibona to Col de Tende it runs to the west before turning to the northwest and then , to the north , near the Colle della Maddalena . Upon reaching the Swiss border , the line of the main chain goes about northeast , a heading it follows until its end near Vienna .
The Alps do not make an impassable block ; they have been traveled by for war and commerce , and later by pilgrims , students and tourists . Crossing places by road , train or foot are called passes . These are depressions in the mountains into which a valley leads from the plains and hilly pre-mountainous places .
The Union Internationale des Associations d'Alpinisme -LRB- UIAA -RRB- has defined a list of 82 `` official '' Alpine 4,000-meter -LRB- 13,123 ft -RRB- peaks . The list has many sub-peaks with little prominence , but good for mountaineering . Here are the twelve four-thousanders with at least 1 km prominence .
Karl Blodig was the first person to climb all the main four-thousand meter peaks , round 1900 .
The reason mountains form is usually the moving together of continental plates of the Earth 's crust . The Alps rose as a result of the slow but gigantic pressure of the African plate as it moved north against the stable Eurasian landmass .
This all took place in the Tertiary period , mostly in the Miocene and Pliocene . That 's about 35 to 5 million years ago .
The Alps are just a part of a larger orogenic belt of mountain chains , called the Alpide belt . It reaches through southern Europe and Asia from the Atlantic Ocean most of the way to the Himalayas .
A gap in these mountain chains in central Europe separates the Alps from the Carpathians off to the east . Subsidence is the cause of the gaps in between .
A great and ancient ocean was once between Africa and Europe , the Tethys Ocean . Now sediments of the Tethys Ocean basin and its Mesozoic and early Cenozoic strata sit high above sea level . Even metamorphic basement rocks are found high on Mont Blanc , the Matterhorn , and other high peaks in the Pennine Alps and Hohe Tauern .
The formation of the Mediterranean Sea is a more recent development .
The Alps are popular both in summer and in winter . The Alps as a place for sightseeing and sports . Winter sports -LRB- Alpine and Nordic skiing , snowboarding , tobogganing , snowshoeing , ski tours -RRB- can be learned in most regions from December to April . In summer , the Alps are popular with hikers , mountain bikers , paragliders , and mountaineers . There are also alpine lakes which attract swimmers , sailors and surfers . The lower places and bigger towns of the Alps are well served by motorways and main roads , but higher passes and by-roads can be bad even in the summer . Many passes are closed in winter . Many airports around the Alps -LRB- and some within -RRB- , as well as long-distance rail links from all bordering countries , afford large numbers of travelers easy access from abroad . The Alps normally has more than 100 million visitors a year .
The typical treesâ '' oak , beech , ash and sycamore maple have a natural height limit : the ` tree line ' . Their upper limit matches the change in climate which comes with increasing height . The change from a temperate to a colder climate is also shown true by a change in the wild flowering plant life . This limit normally lies about 1200 m above the sea on the north side of the Alps . On the southern slopes , it often reaches to 1500 m , sometimes even to 1700 m.
The Alps do not always have the typical trees . People have felled them in many places . Except for the beech forests of the Austrian Alps , forests of the typical deciduous trees are hardly found . Where such woods were , Scots pine and Norway spruce now grow . These trees are less sensitive to the attacks of goats who eat the saplings of deciduous trees .
Above the tree line , there is often a band of dwarf pine trees -LRB- Pinus mugo -RRB- , which is taking place of dwarf shrubs . These shrubs are Rhododendron ferrugineum -LRB- on acid soils -RRB- or Rhododendron hirsutum -LRB- on non-acid soils -RRB- .
Above this is the alpine meadow . Above the alpine meadow is where plant life becomes less and less common . At these great heights , the plants are likely to make separate groups . In the Alps , many species of flowering plants have been recorded above 4000 m. These are like Ranunculus glacialis , Androsace alpina and Saxifraga biflora .

Its scientific name , Macropus giganteus means gigantic -LRB- huge -RRB- large-foot , and the Eastern Grey is the second biggest marsupial on earth . The Red Kangaroo is the largest .
Indigenous Australian names for the Eastern Grey include iyirrbir and kucha . The Eastern Grey kangaroo was first seen by Europeans when Captain James Cook was fixing his ship near Cooktown , Queensland . He took a specimen back to England . The Eastern Grey is also the kangaroo on the Australian Coat of Arms . Captain John Hunter , later Governor of New South Wales painted a watercolor in 1788 , of the Eastern Grey which was published in his book , `` Birds and Flowers of New South Wales , painted on the spot in 1788 , 1789 and 1790 '' . This painting can be seen online here .
The Eastern Grey has a soft gray , or sometimes brown fur . The fur on the chest and stomach is more pale , sometimes white . They have a small head and large ears . Their tails are about 120 c long . The male is much larger than the female . They have long eye lashes which protect their eyes from the sun . They live for around 15 â '' 20 years . Because they are marsupials , the female carries its young in special pouch . Babies are born about five weeks after mating . The tiny baby which is only about 15 millimetres long , and weighs less than one gram , crawls up into the pouch . Inside the pouch there are four nipples . The baby kangaroo , called a joey , will only use one of the nipples . It lives in the pouch for about eight months . It still drinks milk from its mother until about 18 months of age . The mother is able to have another joey in the pouch , which feeds from a different nipple . The mother provides a different mix of milk to each nipple . A joey can remain with its mother until it becomes an adult , at about four years old .
The Eastern Grey is the species most commonly seen in Australia . It lives near the big cities of the south and east coast . It likes open grassland with areas of bush for daytime shelter . Like all kangaroos , it is mainly a nocturnal animal , and it is crepuscular , which means it is active early in the morning , and early in the evening . They live in large groups of up to 100 kangaroos , called `` mobs ' .
The Eastern Grey is a herbivore , which means it grass and small shrubs . It mainly eats during early morning and evening . They do not need to drink water as they can get enough moisture from the plants that they eat .
The Eastern Grey Kangaroo can travel very fast over land . They can jump up to 9 m in a single leap . The fastest recorded speed of any kangaroo was 64 k set by a large female Eastern Grey Kangaroo . Kangaroos use less energy if they travel faster . When they go slowly they walk on all four legs , and use their tail as well .
It is often said that kangaroo numbers have increased since the European settlement of Australia . There are more areas of grassland and less forest , less dingos , and more man made watering holes . The current population of the species is about two million . Because of this the Eastern Grey has been killed in some parts of Australia to stop them from eating all the grass and then dying from starvation .

The sebaceous glands are microscopic -LRB- tiny -RRB- glands in the skin which produce an oily\/waxy substance , called sebum , to lubricate -LRB- oil -RRB- the skin and hair . In people , these glands are found in greatest amounts on the face and scalp , joined near the top inside hair follicles or sweat pores . However , they are in all skin areas except the palms and soles of the feet . There are different kinds of these glands and sebum . In the eyelids , meibomian sebaceous glands emit a special kind of sebum into tears . There are several related medical conditions , including : acne , sebaceous cysts , hyperplasia , sebaceous adenoma and sebaceous gland carcinoma -LRB- see section below : Diseases -RRB- . Washing skin or hair with plain detergent can cut the amount of sebum in oily skin . Also , water temperature over 84 F can keep sebum melted during a wash.
As a branched kind of acinar gland , the sebaceous glands are found in people all over the skin except in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet .
Sebaceous glands are often found in hair-covered areas , where they are connected near the top of hair follicles -LRB- see image at top -RRB- . The glands deposit sebum on each hair , and bring it to the skin surface along the hair shaft . The structure consisting of hair , hair follicle , arrector pili muscle , and sebaceous gland is known as a pilosebaceous unit .
Sebaceous glands are also found in non-haired areas -LRB- glabrous skin -RRB- of the eyelids , nose , penis , labia minora , and nipples . Here , the sebum travels along ducts which end inside sweat pores near the surface of the skin .
At the rim of the eyelids , meibomian glands are a specialized form of sebaceous gland . They secrete a form of sebum -LRB- known as meibum -RRB- onto the eye , which slows the drying of tears .
Sebaceous glands produce the oily , waxy substance called sebum -LRB- Latin , meaning fat or tallow -RRB- that is made of fat -LRB- lipids -RRB- , wax , and the leftover dead fat-producing cells . In the glands , sebum is produced within specialized cells and is released as these cells burst ; sebaceous glands are thus classified as holocrine glands .
Sebum has no smell , but its bacterial breakdown can produce a bad smell . Sebum is the cause of some people experiencing `` oily '' hair , as in hot weather or if not washed for several days . Earwax is partly composed of sebum . Sebum can be washed using plain detergent , to dissolve the waxy material in the skin . Also , water for washing should be over 84 F to keep the sebum melted .
Excess sebum has been linked to eating red meats , fried , oily or other foods , but studies are not conclusive .
It is commonly believed that sebum acts to save skin from drying or to waterproof hair and skin . But some scientists have contended that `` low levels of sebaceous gland activity are not correlated with dry skin '' , and it may serve little or no purpose in modern humans .
The substances in sebum vary between species . In people , the lipid content is as follows :
Also , sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is found only in people , not in animals .
The sebaceous glands of a human fetus in utero secrete a substance called Vernix caseosa , a `` waxy '' or `` cheesy '' white substance covering the skin of newborn babies .
The activity of the sebaceous glands increases during puberty because of heightened levels of androgens . In males , sebaceous glands begin to appear predominantly on the penis , on the shaft and around the rim of the penile head during and after puberty . This is however normal , not to be confused with an STD . In females , they appear predominantly in the labia minora .
Sebaceous glands are involved in skin problems such as oily skin , acne , and keratosis pilaris . In the skin pores , sebum and keratin can create a hyperkeratotic plug called a `` microcomedo '' which can block a pore and cause pimples . The prescription medicine isotretinoin significantly reduces the amount of sebum produced by the sebaceous glands , and is used to treat acne .
The extreme use -LRB- up to 10 times doctor-prescribed amounts -RRB- of anabolic steroids by bodybuilders , for muscle gain can also cause acne . The sebaceous gland is stimulated due to some steroid conversion into dihydrotestosterone . This event may cause serious acne on the face , neck , chest , back and shoulders .
A blocked sebaceous gland can result in a sebaceous cyst .
A condition involving enlarged sebaceous glands is known as sebaceous hyperplasia .
Sebaceous gland carcinoma is a very uncommon and aggressive form of cancer involving the sebaceous glands ; sebaceous adenoma is a more benign neoplasm of the sebaceous glands .
Sebum can also build up around body piercings .
Certain species of Demodex mites feed on sebum and are commonly found in the sebaceous glands of mammals , including those of humans .

The Royal Navy is the navy of the United Kingdom . It is the oldest part of the British fighting forces . Because it is the oldest , it is called the `` Senior Service '' . From the 18th century until World War II , it was the largest and strongest navy in the world . The Royal Navy was very important in making Britain the superpower of that time . The Naval Service is made up of the Royal Navy , Royal Marines , Royal Fleet Auxiliary and reserve forces . The Naval Service had 42,700 personel -LRB- people -RRB- as of April 2009 .
The Royal Navy is the second largest navy in the world in terms of gross tonnage -LRB- weight and size of all their ships -RRB- . The Royal Navy has 90 ships including aircraft carriers , submarines , minesweepers and patrol vessels as well as the ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary . All ships in the Royal Navy are called `` Her Majesty 's ships '' -LRB- Or HMS for short -RRB- , because by constitution the Queen owns them and has command over them .
During the Cold War , the Royal Navy mainly focused on hunting for Soviet submarines . These submarines were most active in the North Atlantic Ocean , the ocean near Britain . With the fall of the Soviet Union , the Royal Navy focuses of deep sea exploration .
In law , the head of the Royal Navy is the monarch , holding the ceremonial title of Lord High Admiral . The professional head of the naval service is the First Sea Lord . He is a member of the Defense Council and the Admiralty Board . The Navy Board is below Admiralty Board and is responsible for running the Navy .

The strength of the fleets of the united Kingdom of England was an important element in the kingdom 's power in the 10th century . At one point Aethelred II had an especially large fleet built by a national levy of one ship for every 310 hides of land , but it is uncertain whether this was a standard or exceptional model for raising fleets . During the period of Danish rule in the 11th century a standing fleet was maintained by taxation , and this continued for a time under the restored English regime of Edward the Confessor , who frequently commanded fleets in person .
A permanent Royal Navy , with its own staff , dockyards and a group of purpose-built warships , was created in the 16th century in the reign of Henry VIII.221-37 Under Elizabeth I England became involved in a war with Spain . Privately-owned ships combined with the Navy Royal in highly profitable raids against Spanish commerce and colonies.238-53 , 281-6 , 292-6 In 1588 Philip II of Spain sent the Spanish Armada against England to stop English support for the Dutch rebels , to stop English pirate activity , and to depose Elizabeth . The Spaniards sailed from Lisbon , planning to escort an invasion force from the Spanish Netherlands . The plan failed due to poor planning , English tactics , blocking action by the Dutch , and bad weather .253 -71

Mammals are a group of vertebrate animals which form the class Mammalia . They have these features :
Most mammals -LRB- but not all -RRB- bear live young . All mammals feed their young on milk , which is made by glands in the skin or the mammary glands . All mammals protect and look after their young , though details differ greatly . Mammals are warm-blooded ; they regulate their body temperature . The heat they need to live is made chemically inside their body . With this goes a higher rate of metabolism , and heat-retaining fur . One diagnostic feature is the lower jaw which , unlike earlier forms , is composed of a single bone , the dentary . Another diagnostic feature is the neocortex of the brain , which no other vertebrate has .
Almost all mammals give birth to live young . There are only two mammals that lay eggs , called Monotremes , the Duck-billed Platypus Ornithorhynchus , and the Spiny Anteater Echidna , with four species . All are confined to Australia and New Guinea , and are the sole survivors of an earlier group of mammals . However , like other mammals , they feed milk to their young , and protect and look after them .
Other mammals are divided into the Marsupials and the Eutheria , the placental mammals . Marsupials are mammals with pouches to carry young in , like the kangaroo . All other mammals are Eutherian .
Mammals are found on land and in water , and also in the air , where they compete with lots of other animals . Their ability to move from place to place and adapt has made them a most efficient group . Many mammals live in cold places . These mammals have thick hair or blubber to keep them warm . Others may live in rainforests . Some live in deserts , and still others are in rivers , lakes , and seas all around the world .
Sea-going mammals , the Cetacea and the pinnipeds , are very successful and significant predators . This includes the whales , seals , walrus , dolphins and others . In the air , the bats -LRB- Chiroptera -RRB- are the mammalian order with the most species . They ` own ' the nighttime , since birds are largely diurnal -LRB- daytime -RRB- animals .
On land the rodents -LRB- rats , mice -RRB- are hugely successful , more common in numbers than any other mammals . Large mammals on land have been hunted to extinction in many parts of the world . The ones which remain are now being better protected .
Last , but certainly not least , are the primates . Their natural habitat , with few exceptions are the forests . Most live in the trees , with hands that grasp , good color vision , and intelligence . In the Pliocene period some moved out onto the savannahs as grassland began to replace forests .
This sort of classification is not traditional , but it does reflect our knowledge of palaeontology and evolution .
A somewhat standardized classification system has been adopted by most current mammalogy classroom textbooks . It is based on living animals . The following taxonomy of extant and recently extinct mammals is from Vaughan et al . 2000 .

A bread roll is a piece of bread , usually small and round and is usually a side dish . Bread rolls are most times used in the same way as sandwiches are - cut in half , with items like butter placed between the two halves .
There are many names for bread rolls , especially in local versions of British English . These were named depending on how the dough was made and how the roll was cooked . Over time , most people started using one name to call all equal products regardless of whether it is right or not .
Bread rolls are common in Europe , mostly in Germany and Austria . They are also common in both Australia and New Zealand , and very common in Canada . In Germany and Austria , there is a large variety of bread rolls , ranging from white rolls made with wheat flour , to dark rolls containing mostly rye flour . Many variants include spices , such as coriander and cumin , nuts , or seeds , such as sesame seeds , poppy seed or sunflower seeds .

Strychnine -LRB- -LRB- British , U.S. -RRB- , \/ - naÉ n \/ or \/ - nÉ n \/ -LRB- U.S. -RRB- -RRB- is a very toxic colorless crystalline alkaloid . It is very poisonous , the LD50 is about 10 mg . Strychnine is soluble in alcohol and chloroform , but not in water .
Strychnine can act as a stimulant , much like caffeine . It is on the list of substances tested for doping in sports .
The substance was used as a pesticide , especially for killing small vertebrates such as birds and rodents . Strychnine causes muscular convulsions . It leads to death through asphyxia or exhaustion . The most common source is from the seeds of the Strychnos nux vomica tree . Strychnine is one of the most bitter substances known . Its taste is detectable in concentrations as low as 1 ppm .
Between 30 and 120mg can kill an adult human . Strychnine is rapidly absorbed by Mucous membranes . If its given under the skin , or intravenously , a quantity of 15 mg may be enough to kill an adult . Benzodiazepines -LRB- such as Diazepam -RRB- are used by default for emergency treatment .
Unlike the illustrations given in fiction crime novels , Strychnine is not very good for killing someone -LRB- when given orally -RRB- . This is because even diluted at 1:130.000 it can still be tasted . Despite this , some murders happened with Strychnine . Thomas Neill Cream , a serial killer used it on some of his victims .
Strychnine acts as a blocker or antagonist at the inhibitory or strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor -LRB- GlyR -RRB- , a ligand-gated chloride channel in the spinal cord and the brain .
Although it is best known as a poison , small doses of strychnine were once used in medications as a stimulant , a laxative and as a treatment for other stomach ailments . A 1934 drug guide for nurses described it as `` among the most valuable and widely prescribed drugs '' . Strychnine 's stimulant effects also led to its use historically for enhancing performance in sports . Because of its high toxicity and tendency to cause convulsions , the use of strychnine in medicine was eventually abandoned once safer alternatives became available .
The dosage for medical use was cited as between `` 1\/60th grainâ `` 1\/10th grain '' , which is between 1.1 milligrams and 6.4 milligrams in modern measures . Normally the maximum dosage used was 3.2 mg , half of a `` full dose '' . A lethal dose was cited as 1\/2 a grain -LRB- 32 mg -RRB- , but people have been known to die from as little as 5 mg of strychnine .
Christian hedonism is a controversial Christian doctrine in some evangelical churches , partly those of the Reformed tradition .

`` A Day in the Life '' is a song by the English rock group The Beatles , the last song on the group 's 1967 album Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band . It is a very famous song .
Many people thinl that the first verse was written about the death of Tara Browne , the 21-year-old heir to the Guinness fortune and close friend of Lennon and McCartney , who had crashed his Lotus Elan on 18 December 1966 when a Volkswagen pulled out of a side street into his path in Redcliffe Gardens , Earls Court . In many interviews , Lennon said this was the verse 's main inspiration . However , George Martin thinks that it is a drug reference -LRB- as is the line `` I 'd love to turn you on '' and other passages from the song -RRB- and while writing the lyrics Lennon and McCartney were imagining a stoned politician who had stopped at a set of traffic lights .
The description of the accident in `` A Day in the Life '' was not a literal description of Browne 's fatal accident . Lennon said , `` I did n't copy the accident . Tara did n't blow his mind out , but it was in my mind when I was writing that verse . The details of the accident in the song â '' not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene â '' were similarly part of the fiction . ''
The final verse was inspired by an article in the Daily Mail in January 1967 regarding a substantial number of potholes in Blackburn , a town in Lancashire . However , he had a problem with the words of the final verse , not being able to think of how to connect `` Now they know how many holes it takes to '' and `` the Albert Hall '' . His friend Terry Doran suggested that they would `` fill '' the Albert Hall .
`` A Day in the Life '' is in the key of G major , but , as Alan W. Pollack explains , `` its true center of gravity is in the parallel minor and Major keys of E. '' The verses are in G-major\/E-minor and the bridge is in E-major . A 4\/4 meter is used throughout . The song is laid out with an instrumental beginning , followed by three verses -LRB- 0:13 -RRB- , an orchestral crescendo -LRB- 1:45 -RRB- , a middle section -LRB- 2:16 -RRB- , an orchestral bridge -LRB- 2:49 -RRB- , the final verse -LRB- 3:19 -RRB- , a second orchestral climax -LRB- 3:50 -RRB- , and a final piano chord -LRB- 4:21 â `` 5:05 -RRB- .
Each verse sung by Lennon follows the same basic layout , but each has a different way of ending . The first verse , which is twenty measures , ends with a repetition of the F major chord progression before returning to the home key . The second verse , two measures shorter than the first , ends on the C major chord rather than repeating the F major progression . The third verse is the same as the second , except that there is one more measure -LRB- to accommodate the `` I 'd love to '' -RRB- , and the verse does not return to the home key . Instead it leads to a bridge , a long climax starting from low E to an E several octaves higher . Random cymbal crashes are interspersed near the end to `` challenge your sense of meter '' .
An alarm clock rings , beginning McCartney 's verse . While the pulse of this section remains the same , the accents suggest a tempo twice as fast as that of the verses before . The three chords in this nineteen measures long section are the I , flat VII , and V chords -LRB- E , D , and B -RRB- . This is followed by an orchestral bridge : a repeated circle of fifths -LRB- from C to E -RRB- over twenty measures . The bridge is accompanied by a wordless vocal -LRB- `` Ahhhh ... '' -RRB- and leads to the fourth and final verse .
The final verse has the same layout as the third verse . Starr 's drumming , however , retains its double-time feel from McCartney 's section . This verse leads to the second crescendo . However , after the orchestra hits its highest note , there is a measure of silence , which leads to the final E-major piano chord .
Following the final orchestral climax , the song ends with one of the most famous final chords in music history . Lennon , McCartney , Starr , and Evans shared three different pianos , with Martin on the Harmonium , and all played an E-major chord simultaneously . The final chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out . Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio , including rustling papers and a squeaking chair .
The piano chord was a replacement for a failed vocal experiment : on the evening following the orchestra recording session , the four Beatles had recorded an ending of their voices humming the chord , but after multiple overdubs they wanted something with more impact .
McCartney provided the fourth verse of the song , a short piano piece he had been working on by himself , with lyrics about a commuter whose uneventful morning routine leads him to drift off into a dream . He had written the piece as a wistful recollection of his younger years , which included riding the bus to school , smoking , and going to class . The line `` I 'd love to turn you on '' , which concludes both verse sections , was , according to Lennon , also contributed by McCartney ; Lennon said `` I had the bulk of the song and the words , but he contributed this little lick floating around in his head that he could n't use for anything .

The argument of periapsis -LRB- Ï -RRB- is the orbital element describing the angle of an orbiting body 's periapsis -LRB- the point of closest approach to the central body -RRB- , relative to its ascending node -LRB- the point where the body crosses the plane of reference from south to north -RRB- . The angle is measured in the orbital plane and in the direction of motion . -LRB- For specific types of orbits , words such as `` perihelion '' -LRB- for Sun-centered orbits -RRB- , `` perigee '' -LRB- for Earth-centered orbits -RRB- , `` pericenter '' -LRB- general -RRB- , etc. may replace the word `` periapsis '' . See apsis for more information . -RRB-
An argument of periapsis of 0 Â means that the orbiting body will be at its closest approach to the central body at the same moment that it crosses the plane of reference from south to north . An argument of periapsis of 90 Â means that the orbiting body will reach periapsis at its northmost distance from the plane of reference .

is a city in Lower Saxony , Germany . It is located in the district of Hildesheim and is about 30 km southeast of Hannover . The city is on the banks of the Innerste river , which is a smaller river that flows into the Leine river . It can be reached from Autobahn A7 , which links Kassel , GÃ ttingen and Hannover .
It has about 110,000 people living there .
Hildesheim is one of the oldest cities in North Germany . The city may have been founded when the bishop moved from Elze to the Innerste ford , where it was an important market on the Hellweg trade route . The settlement soon grew into a town which was awarded market rights by King Otto III in 983 . Originally the market was held on a street called Old Market -LRB- Alter Markt -RRB- , which still exists today . The first market place was laid out around Saint Andrew 's Church . As the city grew larger , a bigger market place became more important . The current market place of Hildesheim was made at the start of the 13th century when the city had about 5,000 people living there . When Hildesheim got city rights in 1249 , it was one of the biggest cities in Northern Germany . For four centuries the clergy ruled Hildesheim , before a city hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence . Construction of the present City Hall started in 1268 , and in 1367 Hildesheim became a member of the Hanseatic League . A war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519-1523 when they engaged in a feud . Hildesheim became protestant in 1542 , and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in imperial -LRB- catholic -RRB- hands . Several villages around the city remained catholic as well . In 1813 , after the Napoleonic Wars , the town became part of the Kingdom of Hanover , which was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 as a province .
The city had bombs dropped on it in World War II , but the bombing had little importance in the war . 28.5 % of the houses were destroyed and 44.7 % damaged . 26.8 % of the houses had no damage . The center , which still had its medieval character until then , was almost levelled . As in many cities , priority was given to rapid building of badly needed housing , and concrete structures took the place of the destroyed buildings . Fortunately , most of the major churches , two of them now UNESCO World Heritage Sites , were rebuilt in the original style soon after the war . During the war , valuable world heritage materials had been hidden in the basement of the city wall . In 1978 , the University of Hildesheim was founded . In the 1980s a reconstruction of the historic center began . Some of the new concrete buildings near the marketplace were torn down . Replicas of the original buildings were built in their place .

A parody is a special piece of art .
Parodies make fun of another piece of art by mocking it .
The parody is an imitation of the original , but exaggerating it , showing clichÃ s which have been used , to make the original look ridiculous or to make a comment about an issue affecting society .

Mesa Verde National Park is a U.S. National Park and UNESCO World Heritage Site . It is in Montezuma County , Colorado , United States .
The Park was created in 1906 to protect some of the best preserved cliff dwellings in the world . The UNESCO listing was , with Yellowstone National Park , the first from the U.S.A.
The park occupies 81.4 square miles -LRB- 211 square kilometers -RRB- near the Four Corners and features ruins of homes and villages built by the Ancestral Puebloan people , sometimes called the Anasazi .
The Ancestral Puebloans made these stone villages their home in the 13th century . However , the first Ancestral Puebloans had settled in Mesa Verde over 600 years before the cliff dwellings were ever built .
These first people are known as the Basketmakers and they lived in pithouses clustered into small villages usually built on mesa tops but sometimes in the overhangs of the cliffs . These hunter-gatherer people settled and began farming and using the bow and arrow , a weapon that was more efficient and accurate than the atlatl .
By 750 AD , the people were building mesa-top villages made of adobe . By the late 12th century they began to build the cliff dwellings for which Mesa Verde is famous .
Mesa Verde is best known for cliff dwellings , which are structures built within caves and under outcropping in cliffs â '' including Cliff Palace , which is thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in North America . The Spanish term Mesa Verde translates into English as `` green table . '' Approximately 600 of the over 4700 archeological sites found in Mesa Verde National Park are cliff dwellings .
Mesa Verde National Park is in the south-western corner of the state of Colorado .
Elevations in the park range from about 6100 t. The terrain is dominated by ridges and valleys running roughly north and south . The northernmost point is 13.2 miles -LRB- 21.2 kilometers -RRB- farther north than the southernmost .
Although explorers from Spain went through the general region in the 18th century , actual sight of the cliffs dwellings by outsiders seems to have first occurred in the latter half of the 19th century .
The fame of Mesa Verde soon began to spread thanks to the Wetherill ranchers and the archeological work of Gustaf NordenskiÃ ld . Vandalism led to President Teddy Roosevelt 's support of protecting the area as a national park in 1906 .
The Zygophyllaceae is a family of flowering plants that contains the bean-caper and caltrop . It includes around 285 species in 22 genera .
In the APG III system of classification , the families Zygophyllaceae and Krameriaceae compose the order Zygophyllales .
Taxonomy is a science . It is about the classification of all things living . Although it is most commonly used in biology , it can be used in other types of classification too . Taxonomy is used with different ranks , the lowest is a species . There can also be sub-species . An organism is a species if two organisms of the same kind can mate . This name is the scientific classification of that species . The name is the same all over the world , so that when scientists from different places talk or write about the living thing , they can understand each other .
The highest rank in the domain of living things is the Kingdom . Each kingdom has many smaller groups in it , called Phyla : see List of animal phyla . Each Phylum has more smaller groups in it , called Classes . This pattern looks like branches on a tree with smaller branches growing from them . Each species is put into a group because of what it does , how and what it eats , special body parts , and so on . At the end of the pattern , the groups -LRB- Genera -RRB- are very small . Then each species in the Genus is given its own name . When someone writes about a living thing and uses this name , they only write the Genus name and the species name , like this :
Felis silvestris catus -LRB- domestic cat -RRB- When someone writes about this animal , the first time they write its name they will write Felis silvestris catus . After the first time they write its name , they will only write the first letter of the Genus , so they will write F. silvestris catus . This is known as binomial nomenclature , because it is a way to describe organisms using two names , the first is the Genus name , and the second is the adjective that denotes the specific species of that genus .
A mnemonic , or a saying to help a person remember something , for that is `` King Phillip Came Over From Greater Spain '' , `` King Phillip Came Over For Good Spaghetti '' , and King Phillip Cried Out `` For Goodness Sake '' .
An important alternative approach to biological classification is cladism , a strict approach which is based on out knowledge of the course of evolution . It uses characters -LRB- traits -RRB- to decide on the branches of the taxonomy .

Other fish with white meat can be used as well , for example whiting or plaice . Many places that serve fish and chips have more than one kind of fish . The customers can then choose what kind of fish they want ...
The fish is always dipped in batter , which is a kind of liquid mixture which hardens upon frying . After that , it will be fried for a short time . The phrase ` fish & chips ' implies that it will be fried in batter ; of course , in a fish restaurant , grilling or boiling would be alternatives . Fish cooked like that do not have batter .
The chips are made from sliced potatoes . They are larger than French fries . Large slices of potatoes are fried .

The periodic table of the chemical elements is a list of known atoms -LRB- chemical elements -RRB- . In the table the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number . The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of electrons or protons in that particular atom .
In the periodic table the elements are arranged into periods and groups .
A row of elements across the table is called a period . Each period has a number : from 1 to 7 . Period 1 has only 2 elements in it : hydrogen and helium . Period 2 and Period 3 both have 8 elements . Other periods are longer .
A column of elements down the table is called a group . There are 18 groups in the standard periodic table . Each group has a number : from 1 to 18 . Elements in a group have electrons arranged in similar ways , which gives them similar chemical properties -LRB- they behave in similar ways -RRB- . For example , group 18 is known as the noble gases because they are all gases and they do not combine with other atoms .
The periodic table can be used by chemists to observe patterns , and relationships between the elements . For example , elements to the top and far left of the table are the most metallic , and elements on the bottom right are the least metallic . -LRB- e.g. lithium is much more metallic than xenon -RRB- . There are also many other patterns and relationships .
There are three systems of group numbers ; one using Arabic numerals -LRB- 1,2,3 -RRB- and the other two using Roman numerals -LRB- I , II , III -RRB- . The Roman numeral names were used at first and are the traditional names ; the Arabic numeral names are newer names that the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry -LRB- IUPAC -RRB- decided to use as well . The IUPAC names were meant to replace the older Roman numeral systems as they used the same names to mean different things , which was confusing .
The Periodic Table was invented and arranged by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev -LRB- 1834-1907 -RRB- .
The color of the number -LRB- atomic number -RRB- above the element symbol shows the state of the element at normal conditions .

Hurricane Carla was one of two Category 5 tropical cyclones . It hit the Texas shore in the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season as a Category 4 hurricane , becoming one of the most powerful storms to ever strike the United States . Hurricane Carla was the second strongest storm to ever hit the Texas shore . The storm caused over $ 2 billion -LRB- 2005 US dollars -RRB- in damages , but because over 500,000 people who lived there moved out only 43 were killed .
A tropical depression started in the western Caribbean Sea on September 3 from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone . It moved northwestward , to become Tropical Storm Carla on the 5th and Hurricane Carla on the 6th . After touching the YucatÃ n Peninsula as a weak hurricane , Carla moved into the Gulf of Mexico and headed for the U.S. Gulf Coast .
As it moved slowly across the Gulf of Mexico , Carla got stronger to its peak of 175 mph -LRB- 280 km\/h -RRB- winds -LRB- Category 5 intensity -RRB- on September 11 . Just before landfall , it weakened , but Carla was still a very strong and unusually large Category 4 hurricane when it touched the shore between Port O'Connor and Port Lavaca , Texas , on the 11th . At the time , Carla became the largest hurricane on record in the Atlantic basin . Along the whole Texas shore , hurricane warnings were given , and people were moved out of their homes in low-lying areas .
Storm surge was measured at 22 feet -LRB- 6.6 m -RRB- near the heads of bays , in some places reaching 10 miles inland . Because of its large size , the whole Texas shore was hit , and damage was seen as far away as Dallas . Winds were reported to be 115 mph in Matagorda , 110 mph in Victoria and 88 mph in Galveston . Wind gusts as high as 170 mph were recorded at Port Lavaca . Pressure at landfall was measured at 931 mb -LRB- hPa -RRB- , making it the eighth most intense hurricane to strike the United States in the 20th century . Then little-known newsman Dan Rather reported live from the Galveston Seawall during the storm , an act that would be imitated by later reporters . This marked the first live television broadcast of a hurricane .
Much of the damage was done well away from the landfall site , as Carla caused one of the largest hurricane-related tornado outbreaks on record at the time , when 26 tornadoes touched down within its circulation . One F4 tornado ripped through downtown Galveston , killing several -LRB- sources differ on the exact number , varying from 6 to 12 -RRB- . Outside the protection of the Galveston Seawall , structures on the island were severely damaged by storm surge . Damage was reported as far east as the Mississippi River delta .
As Carla weakened , it dropped heavy rain in the Midwest , causing some flooding .
Carla killed 43 people , 31 of them in Texas . The low number of deaths was due to what was then the largest movement of people out of their homes in US history except during a war . One half million people moved inland from exposed coastal areas . Carla caused a total of $ 325 million -LRB- 1961 USD , $ 2.36 billion 2010 USD -RRB- in damage , not much considering Carla 's strength at landfall .
Owing to the intensity of and destruction by the storm , the name Carla was retired , and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane . It was replaced by Carol in the 1965 season .

Autofocus is a procedure for finding the correct position of the lens for a scene . The autofocus feature can be provided in a system which includes a movable optical element , a motor , an image sensor and a processing unit . The autofocus procedure is done by changing the lense position and image quality measurements in each position . The position that provides the image with the best quality will be used as the best focus .
The image quality may be estimated using image gradients . To speed-up the autofocus procedure , the autofocus is done in two steps : the first run over the full range of the lenses movement with a significant step will provide the estimated position which will be improved in the second run over the small range with a small step . Interpolation between the few best positions may improve the results accuracy .

In graphics , superimposition is when an image or video is put on top of an already-existing image or video . This is usually done to add to the overall image effect or to hide something -LRB- such as when a different face is superimposed over the original face in a photograph -RRB- .
This technique is used in cartography to produce photomaps by superimposing grid lines , contor lines and other linear or textual mapping features over aerial photographs .
Superimposition of 2D images containing correlated periodic grid structures may produce moirÃ patterns . Superimposition of two correlated layers comprising parallel lines or curves may give rise line moirÃ patterns . The movement of one of the layers results in a faster movement of the line moirÃ superimposition image . Such optical acceleration is known as moirÃ speedup -LRB- check for the formulas of optical speedup for curved patterns -RRB- . When superimposing two identical layers comprising randomly spaced parallel lines , at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random line moirÃ patterns , namely line Glass patterns -LRB- after Leon Glass , 1969 -RRB- appear . Similarly , when superimposing two identical layers of randomly scattered dots at a small angle or with a small scaling difference random dot Glass patterns , namely random dot moirÃ , appears . When one of the layers embeds complex shapes , such as sequences of symbols forming a text , and another layer contains parallel lines or curves , the superimposition image may gives rise to magnified shapes , called shape moirÃ patterns .

Modesty -LRB- also called demureness or reticence -RRB- is the name for a number of norms of behavior a society expects form the individual people that make up this society .
Different fashions test the level of modesty . People are usually also subjected to peer pressure .
Different levels of modesty apply in different situations , and to different groups of people .
Modesty is a social norm , it does not apply when it can not , such as in an emergency . In the case of an emergency it is more important that doctors treat those that are wounded . It does not matter that doctors may see those people naked . In some cases , it may be necessary that they take off all the clothes , to be able to treat them better .
Some people still insist on maintaining their standards of modesty , even in an emergency situation .
Modesty usually says that the parts of the human body that do not need to be exposed should not be . Usually , this applies to bare skin , hair , undergarments , and especially to intimate parts . Sometimes , the standards do not only say that the respective part should be hidden , but also that special clothing should hide its shape , what it looks like . Certain standards say how the changing of clothes should be done , like using a towel on a beach or closing -LRB- and locking -RRB- a door of a cabin that is provided .
Different cultures have different standards of modesty . But standards are also different according to who the other people are , that could possibly see one 's body :
Social standing or class can also matter . That way , different rules can apply to people of the same social class than to those of other -LRB- or lower -RRB- social classes .
That way , a teacher that would perform at a night club might be seen as bringing the profession into disresapect . Some people say this kind of modesty is body shame .
Too much modesty is called prudishness . As a medical condition it is also called gymnophobia . Excessive immodesty is called exhibitionism . Proponents of modesty often see it as respect for their bodies and the feelings of themselves and others , and some people believe it may reduce sexual crimes . Critics argue that it 's not healthy to have a negative attitude toward the human body . Some assert that there may be a correlation between repressive body attitudes and undesirable outcomes such as sexual crimes , violence , and stress .
The cultural and religious background heavily influence the views a person has on modesty .
What is called Western culture expects that Intimate body parts are covered in public places at all times . There are exceptions for places where people change clothes , as these are usually differentiated by sex . This means there is one changing-room for men , and another for women . Other exceptions include saunas , which tend to be mixed-sex -LRB- there is one sauna for both men and women -RRB- places .
Special rules also apply for places where bathing is common . It might be tolerated that a woman is topless on a beach , or near a pool . If there is a restaurant near the beach or pool , it is usual , that the woman can be topless on the beach , but if she wants to eat something in the restaurant , that she has to cover her breasts . Very often , such restaurants are visually segregated by a railing . On one side of the railing there is the beach , on the other , there is the restaurant .
There are more and more beaches in cities . This blurs the boundary even more . There may be people in swimsuits next to businesspeople in a suit .
In private homes , the rules may be more relaxed . Nudity among close family members in the home is sometimes permitted , especially in the bedroom and bathroom . Wearing undergarments casually may be permitted as well . Elsewhere in the home , family members may be expected to wear more clothes , casually , especially if guests are present . A bathrobe may fulfill the purpose here .
Naturists have different views . They want to create an environment , were people can feel at ease , even when they are nude , they can be seen nude , or nude people are among them . These values conflict with the current standards of modesty . For this reason , nudists mostly reject the current standards of modesty .
Traditional indigenous cultures such as those in Africa , or the aborigines in Australia have social norms that vary greatly . How much exposure is acceptable varies from nothing for some women , to everything except the glans penis for some men of certain tribes . Certain African cultures think body painting is body coverage . Many think it is an `` attire '' .
There are different standards of modesty for men and women . Western culture expects that both men and women keep their genitals covered . It also expects that women keep their breasts covered , most of the time . There may be exceptions for bathing , or breastfeeding .
Showing naked soldiers bathing became common during the Second World War . Boys in high-school age also swam in the nude , during that time .
Fashion as well as other social norms expect that men cover more body parts than women , such as the midriff and the upper part of the back .
Swimming pants are often larger for men than for women . Before the 1930s , men were generally prohibited from baring their chests in public , even at beaches . Organizations such as the Topfree Equal Rights Association advocate for gender equality in this regard . In 1992 , New York State 's highest court accepted 14th Amendment arguments and struck down the provision in New York 's Exposure of the Person statute that made it illegal for women to bare their chests where men were permitted to do so .
Sexual orientation is a subject that is less and less a taboo . Homosexuality also seems to be more common or more talked about . This has led to stricter levels of modesty in same-sex situations , such as in changing-rooms . In several places , community showers have been converted to single showers , with curtains or doors . Many students no longer shower after exercise . Research has shown a dramatic decline in same-sex sexual activity among adolescent males that correlates with the increasing social visibility of gays and the increasing level of modesty . Related factors are the increasing emphasis on ideal male physiques shown by advertisements and the concern over being photographed and videotaped .
Islamic society thinks modesty is important , but there are different interpretations of what dress should be considered modest . Many Muslim women wear a headscarf -LRB- hijab -RRB- as a sign of modesty . More conservative societies expect that women cover their whole body , except for their hands and their face .
A woman who choses to also cover her face and hands is said to be expressing greater `` modesty and holiness '' . In some Islamic societies , women wear the niqab , an all-encompassing garment intended to conceal every part of the body , sometimes including the eyes . Wearing a niqab -LRB- sometimes referred to as a burqa , although this term only technically applies to an Afghan all-in-one garment -RRB- is common in some countries with a majority Muslim population .
In most Muslim countries a woman can chose how to express her modesty . More conservative countries such as Afghanistan or Iran do have laws that say what kind of dress a woman should wear . Not obeying these laws can lead to harsh punishments .
Likewise , according to some Islamic interpretations of Hadith , men are required to cover everything from ` navel to knee ' ; with some men choosing to extend this to the traditional Islamic head covering taqiyah -LRB- cap -RRB- , the male counterpart to hijab which closely resembles the Jewish yarmulke but is slightly larger in size . The taqiyah cap may vary in shape , size or color just as the hijab does , with many regional differences according to tradition and personal taste .
A burqini is a swimsuit designed for Muslim women that covers the whole body except the face , the hands and the feet , that enables them to satisfy the requirements of Muslim standards of modesty while enabling them to take part in swimming activities .
Modesty is also important in Judaism , especially in the case of women . An orthodox married woman is expected by their community to cover her hair in public , and sometimes at home . The hair covering may be a scarf , hat , snood , or a wig -LRB- `` sheitel '' -RRB- . Some communities have stricter standards and expect women to cover their elbows and legs , with blouses covering the collarbone and sleeves covering elbows . Skirts are expected to cover the knees . All slits in skirts are expected to be closed . See-through materials may not be used and clothes are expected not to be tight-fitting , provocative , loud in color , or display texts . Some communities apply these standards to girls as young as three .
Non-orthodox Jewish women tend to adopt the fashions of the non-Jewish society in which they live .
Catholics are expected to dress modestly , but there are no `` official guidelines '' . Form time to time , priests and popes have given their opinion . These opinions are not binding , nevertheless many Catholics find them useful .
Pope Pius XII stated that women should cover their upper arms and shoulders , that their skirts should cover at least as far as the knee , and the neckline should not reveal anything . Another example is Giuseppe Cardinal Siri of Genoa , who stated that trousers were unacceptable dress for women . Many tradition-minded Catholics have attempted to further expand on this latter standard .
Some Catholics have attempted to make theories of modesty . Sometimes this is from a sociological perspective , while at other times it takes a more systematic , Thomistic approach , combined with the writings of the Church Fathers . Approaches arguing primarily from traditional practices and traditional authorities , such as the saints , can also be found .
The Church also expects men to dress modestly , but the demands are not as strict for them as for women ; this is largely because men are often thought to be more inherently susceptible to sexual thoughts .

Plant propagation is when a plant is distributed . There are several ways to do this :
Chromium is a chemical element . Its symbol on the periodic table -LRB- a list of all the elements -RRB- is Cr . Its atomic number is 24 . -LRB- The atomic number says where chromium sits in the periodic table . -RRB- Its mass number -LRB- number of protons and neutrons -RRB- is approximately 54 . It always has 24 protons . Most of the times it has 28 neutrons , but sometimes different isotopes have more or less neutrons . As a metal , it has 24 electrons . Its ions have less electrons .
Chromium is a shiny metal . It is reactive , but it reacts with air to produce a very thin coating of chromium -LRB- III -RRB- oxide , which prevents it from rusting any more .
It forms chemical compounds that are colorful . They can be green , yellow , purple , red , orange , black , and blue !
There are two main types of chromium ions , which are found in chromium compounds . One type of chromium ion -LRB- Cr3 + , trivalent chromium -RRB- is required by our body and by those of other animals . If we do not get enough chromium , certain parts of our body may not work properly . We get most of the chromium we need from our food we eat . Chromium is also put into vitamins to make sure that we get enough . If we get too much of this type of chromium , it can harm our body .
Another type of chromium -LRB- Cr6 + -LRB- chromate , hexavalent chromium -RRB- , in the +6 oxidation state -RRB- can cause cancer or make people sick , even though most people do not get exposed to it much . Hexavalent chromium was important in the movie Erin Brockovich . It is found in places that make chromium metal , which is why they need to be cleaned up when they close . Hexavalent chromium can be destroyed by reacting it with reducing agents , turning it into Cr3 + -LRB- trivalent chromium -RRB- . They are strong oxidizing agents .
Chromium occurs as chromite . Chromite is a mixture of iron -LRB- II -RRB- oxide and chromium -LRB- III -RRB- oxide . Its chemical formula is FeCr2O4 . It is heated with sodium carbonate to make sodium chromate , iron -LRB- III -RRB- oxide , and carbon dioxide . The sodium chromate is reacted with sulfuric acid to produce sodium dichromate . The sodium dichromate is reduced by carbon to chromium -LRB- III -RRB- oxide . The chromium -LRB- III -RRB- oxide is reacted with aluminum to make chromium metal . The chromates and dichromates are what make chromium production areas toxic .
Chromium is used in different metal products . Stainless steel is the most common use . It is also used in `` chrome plating '' , where it makes things shiny and stops corrosion . Some chromates were used as pigments , but they are toxic so people do not want to use them anymore .
Chromium metal is nontoxic . But hexavalent chromium is toxic and carcinogenic , and trivalent chromium is mildly toxic in large quantities .

The Mariinsky Theatre is a famous theater of opera and ballet in Saint Petersburg , Russia . It was opened in 1860 and soon became the most important theater for opera and ballet in Russia . Many great operas and ballets of the 19th century were first performed there , including the greatest stage works by Tchaikovsky , Mussorgsky , and Rimsky-Korsakov .
The Mariinsky Theatre is home to the Mariinsky Ballet , Mariinsky Opera and Mariinsky Orchestra . The conductor Valery Gergiev has been the general director there since 1988 .
The theater is named after Empress Maria Alexandrovna , wife of Tsar Alexander II . There is a bust of the Empress in the main entrance hall . The theater 's name has changed several times during its history , because of different political parties that were in power .
The theater building is commonly called the Mariinsky Theatre . The companies that use it have kept the famous Kirov name , which it got during the Soviet period in honor of the murdered Leningrad Communist Party leader , Sergey Kirov -LRB- 1886-1934 -RRB- .
The first ballet groups to perform in St Petersburg were Italian ballet dancers in the early 18th century . Catherine the Great wanted a Russian theater to be built . It was built in 1783 . It was called Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre -LRB- â Kamennyâ is the Russian word for â stoneâ . It was used to distinguish the building from the wooden theater that was being used . -RRB- . The building we see today dates from 1860 . It opened with a performance of Glinkaâ s opera A Life for the Tsar . It was called the Mariinsky Theatre , named after the Empress Maria Alexandrovna . The great choreographer Marius Petipa put on the first performances of many famous ballets such as Tchaikovskyâ s The Sleeping Beauty in 1890 , The Nutcracker in 1892 , Alexander Glazunov 's ballet Raymonda in 1898 , and an updated version of Tchaikovsky 's Swan Lake -LRB- with Lev Ivanov -RRB- in 1895 .
When the theater became the main home of the Imperial Ballet and Opera in 1886 , the theater was improved . Many operas were performed there , including first performances of Mussorgsky 's Boris Godunov , Rimsky-Korsakov 's The Golden Cockerel , Tchaikovsky 's The Queen of Spades and Iolanthe , Prokofiev 's Romeo and Juliet and Cinderella , and Khachaturian 's Spartacus were also produced there .
The imperial and Soviet theater was the home of many great impresarios , conductors , and musicians . The Vaganova Academy of Russia Ballet , the ballet school of the Mariinksy Theatre , started the careers of Mathilde Kschessinskaya , Olga Preobrajenskaya , Anna Pavlova , Tamara Karsavina , Vaslav Nijinsky , Marina Semenova , George Balanchine , Galina Ulanova , Rudolf Nureyev , Natalia Makarova , Mikhail Baryshnikov , Irina Kolpakova , Galina Mezentseva , Altynai Asylmuratova , and in more recent times famous dancers like Ulyana Lopatkina , Diana Vishneva , and Svetlana Zakharova .
Yuri Temirkanov was Principal Conductor from 1976 to 1988 . He conducted many modern and classical operas . Since 1988 , Valery Gergiev has brought even more fame to the theater . It has now got links with many of the world 's great opera houses , including the Royal Opera House , Covent Garden , the Metropolitan Opera , the OpÃ ra Bastille , La Scala , La Fenice , the Tel Aviv Opera , the Washington National Opera and the San Francisco Opera . Today , the Opera Company regularly tours to most of these cities .

In mathematics and statistics , Spearman 's Rank Correlation Coefficient is a measure of correlation , named after its maker , Charles Spearman . It is written in short as the greek letter rho or sometimes as . This means that it is a number that shows how closely two sets of data are linked . It only can be done on data that can be put in order , highest to lowest .
To work out you first have to rank each piece of data . We are going to use the example from the intro of computers and their speed .
So , the computer with the lowest price would be rank 1 . The one higher than that would have 2 . Then , it goes up until it is all ranked . You have to do this to both sets of data .
Next , we have to find the difference between the two ranks . Then , you times the difference by itself , which is called squaring the number . The difference is called , and to show when you square , you write .
Count how much data we have . This data has ranks 1 to 5 , so we have 5 pieces of data . This number is called .
Finally , use everything we have worked out so far in this formula : .
means that we take the total of all the numbers that were in the column . This is because means total .
So , is which is 4 . The formula says times it by 6 , which is 24 .
is which is 120 .
So , to find out , we simply do .
Therefore , Spearmans Rank Correlation Coefficient is 0.2 for this set of data .
always gives an answer between -1 and 1 . The numbers between are like a scale , where -1 is very strong link , 0 is no link , and 1 is also a very strong link . The difference between 1 and -1 is that 1 is positive correlation , and -1 is negative correlation . A graph of data with a value of -1 would look like the graph shown except the line and points would be going from top left to bottom right .
For example , for the data that we did above , was 0.2 So this means that there is positive correlation . But , because it is so close to 0 , it means that the link is not very strong between the two sets of data . So , we can say that those two sets of data are not very linked , and go up together . If it was -0.2 , we could say it was not very linked and as one goes up , the other goes down .
Sometimes , when ranking data , there are 2 or more numbers that are the same . When this happens in , we take the mean or average of the ranks that are the same . These are called tied ranks . To do this , we rank the tied numbers as if they were not tied . Then , we add up all the ranks that they would have , and divide it by how many there is . For example , say we were ranking how well different people did in a spelling test .
These numbers are used in exactly the same way as normal ranks .

A brick is a man-made building material used to make walls and make places to walk .
Bricks are made of clay . Bricks are either formed into molds or cut with wires , and then baked in an oven . The color of a brick depends on the color of the clay from which it was made .
Masons build brick walls . They join bricks together using mortar .
Bricks can be assembled into many different patterns . The most common pattern is called `` running bond '' . A row of bricks is called a course . A wall that is just one brick thick has one wythe .
Bricks used outdoors on the ground are called `` pavers '' .
The oldest shaped bricks found date back to 7,500 B.C. . They have been found in Ã ayÃ nÃ 1\/4 , a place located in the upper Tigris area in south east Anatolia close to Diyarbakir . Newer bricks , dated between 7,000 and 6,395 B.C. , come from Jericho and Catal HÃ 1\/4 yÃ 1\/4 k. The invenÂ tion of the fired brick -LRB- as opposed to the considÂ erably earlier sun-dried mud brick -RRB- is believed to have arisen in about the third millennium BC in the Middle East . Fired bricks were much more resistant to cold and moist weather conditions . Fired bricks enabled the construction of permanent buildings in regions where the harsher climate precluded the use of mud bricks .

A monarchy is a kind of government where a monarch , a kind of hereditary ruler -LRB- someone who inherits their office -RRB- is the head of state . Monarchs usually rule until they die or resign -LRB- when a monarch resigns it is called abdication -RRB- . Most monarchies are hereditary , but some are elected . The most famous elected monarch is the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church . Some common titles for monarchs are King , Queen , Emperor , Empress , Czar , Kaiser , Shah , Emir and Sultan .
Monarchy is one of the oldest kinds of government . Most historians agree that the first monarchies were tribes or small groups of people who decided to let a war-chief or other leader pass on their office to their children . Over time , the rules for deciding who got to become the next monarch became more complicated . In general , the oldest son or , in some countries , daughter , gets to become the next monarch when the old one dies . Kings and other kinds of monarchs have been around for many thousands of years , there are many , for example , mentioned in the Bible as well as ancient historical records . Three of the oldest countries with monarchs that still hold office are the United Kingdom , where the present line of Kings and Queens has been around for nearly 1,000 years , Denmark where the royal line has remained unbroken for almost 1,200 years , and Japan , which has records showing a line of Emperors dating back even farther .
Many monarchs today perform mostly the ceremonial jobs of a head of state , while the head of government , who is usually elected , passes and enforces laws .
An absolute monarchy is a form of government where only the monarch himself or herself is the only source of all laws and the monarch can make any law they want just by deciding it . Any other institution in the country can not make laws that affect the monarch , unless the monarch decides to allow it . Sometimes the monarch is also the head of the state religion and makes religious laws also . All land and property in the country can be taken or given away by the monarch at any time for any reason . The army and navy is under the personal control of the monarch and can be used for any purpose at any time . The monarch can also pick who gets to be the next monarch and can change the rules at any time . There is usually no elected government or Parliament , and if there is one , it has no real power . This kind of government is very rare today .
Countries that are examples of an absolute monarchy are Vatican City , Brunei , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Oman and Swaziland .
A constitutional monarchy is a form of government that is usually a democracy and has a constitution , with the monarch as head of state . Either the monarch has to obey the laws like everyone else , or , if the monarch does not have to obey the same laws as the rest of the people , there are special laws that say what the monarch can and can not do . The monarch usually can not decide their special laws on their own . There may be laws about who the monarch 's children can marry , for example , that are passed by the Parliament or Congress . For example , in the Netherlands , if a member of the royal family marries without the permission of Parliament , they can not become king or queen themselves . The army and navy may swear an oath to the monarch , but the real power to control it is given to the elected government . There are laws about property and succession -LRB- who gets to be the next monarch -RRB- that can only be changed by the elected government . Usually the monarch must sign laws into effect , but they are required to follow the will of the elected government .
A constitutional monarchy usually has separation of power , and the monarch often has only ceremonial functions , such as representing the country while traveling or acting as a symbol for the whole country -LRB- not for a particular political party -RRB- . Constitutional monarchs usually do not vote , even when it is legal for them to do so . Voting would mean that they picked a side in political arguments and then could not claim to represent everyone in the country . Some constitutional monarchies give the power to veto laws to the monarch , but in most countries where this is the case it is a power that is very rarely used . In countries where the monarch can dismiss or appoint governments , this is usually only done to make sure that the democratic process is respected , without taking sides in politics . Appointments to public office made by constitutional monarchs are generally approved by the democratically elected government beforehand .
Examples of Constitutional monarchies are the United Kingdom , New Zealand , Australia , The Netherlands , Norway , Denmark , Sweden , Belgium , Japan and Spain . Thailand has a monarch who sometimes take part in politics to influence the government unlike in other constitutional monarchies , but he still is subject to law .
A laxative is a food or drug taken to make bowel movements easier , or to treat constipation . Sometimes taking powerful or lots of laxatives can cause diarrhea or a flatulence .
Laxatives work by helping your intestines digest undigested food , and do not make you lose weight . Despite this , some people with eating disorders take laxatives in an attempt to lose weight .

Shonisaurus is the largest ichthyosaur , and the largest extinct marine animal that has yet been found . It was first discovered in rocks of the Upper Triassic in Nevada , and later in British Columbia .
Fossils of Shonisaurus were first found in a large deposit in Nevada in 1920 . Thirty years later , they were excavated , uncovering the remains of 37 very large ichthyosaurs . These were named Shonisaurus , -LRB- `` Lizard from the Shoshone Mountains '' -RRB- .
Shonisaurus lived 216 -- 203 million years ago . The better known S. popularis species was about 15 metres -LRB- 50ft -RRB- long , but a more recently discovered species , S. sikkanniensis , was longer still , at about 21m -LRB- 70ft -RRB- .
Shonisaurus had a long pointed mouth that contained teeth only at the front end . It had a large whale-like body , a long dolphin-like snout , and its flippers were much longer , and narrower than in other ichthyosaurs . All of these features suggest that Shonisaurus may be a relatively specialised offshoot of the main ichthyosaur evolutionary line .
The first species discovered , S. popularis , was adopted as the state fossil of Nevada in 1984 . Excavations , begun in 1954 under the direction of Charles Camp and Samuel Welles of the University of California , Berkeley , were continued by Camp throughout the 60s .
The Nevada fossil sites can currently be viewed at the Berlin-Ichthyosaur State Park . The discovery of S. sikkanniensis in British Columbia in the 1990s made S. popularis the smaller of the Shonisaurus species . An ichthyosaur found in the Himalayan mountains called Himalayasaurus , may be the same animal as Shonisaurus .

Caesium -LRB- or cesium -RRB- is the chemical element with the atomic number 55 on the periodic table . Its symbol is Cs .
Caesium is an alkali metal . Its melting point is low -LRB- 28 Â C -RRB- . It is extremely reactive . Because of its high reactivity , it is a dangerous chemical . It may set itself on fire -LRB- ignite -RRB- in air . It explodes on contact with water . It reacts more violently than the other alkali metals with water . Consequently , caesium is stored in mineral oil .
Caesium is a rare element . Since there is little caesium on the Earth , it is rather expensive . The human body does not need caesium . In large quantities , it is mildly poisonous because it resembles potassium , which the body does need .
Caesium was first described in 1861 , by Gustav Robert Kirchhoff and Robert Wilhelm Bunsen . They were testing mineral water , from Bad DÃ 1\/4 rkheim . After they separated calcium , strontium , magnesium and lithium , they saw two lines in the `` blue '' range of the spectometry . Because of these lines , they concluded that in addition to the elements already found , there must be another unknown substance in the mineral water . They named this substance caesium , after the color blue .
Caesium has at least 39 known isotopes ranging in atomic mass from 112 to 151 . Only one of these , Cs , is stable . Therefore , the naturally-occurring isotope of caesium is Cs , which is not radioactive . Cs is used in atomic clocks , its vibration frequency used to define the length of the second . Another isotope , Cs does not occur naturally but is produced as a byproduct of nuclear fission . It is intensely radioactive and used as an industrial gamma ray source .
Caesium forms compounds with many other chemical elements . Caesium formate is used in oil drilling because of its high density .

Its back , sides , and head are usually covered with orangish-red fur , and its neck and chest are covered with white fur . Its legs and paws are normally black .
Red foxes hunt alone . Because they are carnivorous , they feed on rodents , birds , rabbits , and other small animals . However , some red foxes eat fruit and vegetables , fish , frogs , and even worms . The red fox will continue to hunt even when it is full . It stores leftover food to eat later . When they are raised by humans domestically , they can also eat pet food . Red Foxes hunt mostly at night , sunset , and dawn .
Red foxes usually mate in the winter . The vixen -LRB- female fox -RRB- normally gives birth to a litter of 2 to 12 pups . When red foxes are born , they are brown or gray . Although a new red coat usually grows in one month , some red foxes have other colored coats such as golden , reddish-brown , silver , or even black . The mother of the pups feed them at first by regurgitating food into their mouths .

Cabell was born into a wealthy Virginian family . His father , Robert Gamble Cabell II -LRB- 1847 â `` 1922 -RRB- , was a physician . His mother , Anne Harris -LRB- 1859 â `` 1915 -RRB- , was the daughter of Col. and Mrs James R. Branch . Cabell 's great-grandfather , William H. Cabell , was Governor of Virginia from 1805 to 1808 .

He went to the College of William and Mary in 1894 at the age of fifteen . He graduated in 1898 . While an undergraduate , Cabell taught French and Greek at the college . Ellen Glasgow , a writer and close friend of Cabell said that he had a friendship with a professor at the college which some people thought was `` too intimate '' . Because of this , Cabell had to leave the college . He was later allowed back and finished his degree .
Cabell worked from 1898 to 1900 as a newspaper reporter in New York City . He returned to Richmond in 1901 . In Richmond , he worked several months for the Richmond News .
Many things happened to Cabell in 1901 . His first stories were accepted for publication . It was believed for a short time that Cabell murdered John Scott , a wealthy person in Richmond . There was a rumor that Scott was `` involved '' with Cabell 's mother .

The book was seen as being bad by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice . They tried to bring a prosecution for obscenity . The case went on for two years before Cabell and his publishers won . Many of the things in the book were double entendres . They had one meaning which was bad and also had a decent meaning . It appeared that what had actually offended the prosecution most was a joke about papal infallibility . Cabell took an author 's revenge . The new edition of 1926 included a ` lost ' section which was not in the earlier version . In it , the hero is put on trial by the Philistines . A large dung beetle is the chief prosecutor .

Cabell is now forgotten by most people but his work affected later writers of fantasy fiction . Robert Heinlein 's Job , A comedy of Justice has an appearance of the Slavic god Koschei -LRB- from Jurgen -RRB- . Fritz Leiber 's Swords of Lankhmar was also affected by Jurgen . Jack Vance 's Dying Earth books show a similar style to Cabell 's writing . Cugel the Clever in those books is very similar to Jurgen .

The Federally Administered Tribal Areas -LRB- FATA -RRB- in Pakistan are areas of Pakistan outside the four provinces , comprising a region of some 27,220 kmÂ -LRB- 10,507 miÂ -RRB- . Miran Shah is the tribal capital . There are seven areas known as Agencies and six areas known as Frontier Regions .
Lithium -LRB- symbol Li -RRB- is the third chemical element in the periodic table . This means that it has 3 protons in its nucleus and 3 electrons around it . Its atomic number is 3 . Its mass number is 6.94 . It has two common isotopes , 6Li and 7Li . 7Li is more common . 92.5 % of lithium is 7Li . Lithium is a soft silvery metal that is very reactive . It is used in lithium batteries and certain medicines .
Lithium is one of the alkali metals . Lithium is a silvery solid metal -LRB- when freshly cut -RRB- . It is very soft . Thus it can be cut easily with a knife . It melts at a low temperature . It is very light , similar to wood . It is the least dense metal and the least dense element in a solid or liquid state . It can hold more heat than any other solid element . It conducts heat and electricity easily .
It will react with water , giving off hydrogen to form a basic solution -LRB- lithium hydroxide -RRB- . Because of this , lithium must be stored in petroleum jelly . Sodium and potassium can be stored in oil but lithium can not because it is so light . It will just float on the oil and not be protected by it .
Lithium also reacts with halogens . It can react with nitrogen gas to make lithium nitride . It reacts with air to make a black tarnish and then a white powder of lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate .
Lithium forms chemical compounds with only one oxidation state : +1 . Most of them are white and unreactive . They make a bright red color when heated in a flame . They are a little toxic . Most of them dissolve in water . Lithium carbonate is less soluble in water than the other alkali metal carbonates like sodium carbonate .
It does not occur as an element in nature . It only is in the form of lithium compounds . The ocean has a large amount of lithium in it . Certain granites have large amounts of lithium . Most living things have lithium in them . There are some places where much lithium is in the salt . Some silicates have lithium in them .
Lithium -LRB- Greek lithos , meaning `` stone '' -RRB- was discovered by Johann Arfvedson in 1817 . In 1818 , Christian Gmelin observed that lithium salts give a bright red color in flame . W.T. Brande and Sir Humphrey Davy later used electrolysis on lithium oxide to isolate the element . Lithium was used first in greases . Then nuclear weapons became a big use of lithium . Lithium was also used to make glass melt easier and make aluminium oxide melt easier in making aluminium . Now lithium is used mainly in batteries .
It was apparently given the name `` lithium '' because it was discovered from a mineral , while other common alkali metals were first discovered in plant tissue .
It is made by getting lithium chloride from pools and springs . The lithium chloride is melted and electrolyzed . This makes liquid lithium and chlorine .
Its main use is in batteries . Lithium is used as an anode in the lithium battery . It has more power than batteries with zinc , like alkaline cells . Lithium ion batteries also have lithium in them , though not as an element . It is also used in heat transfer alloys . Lithium is used to make organolithium compounds . They are used for very strong bases .
Lithium compounds are used in some drugs known as mood stabilizers . Lithium niobate is used in radio transmitters in cell phones . Some lithium compounds are also used in ceramics . Lithium chloride can absorb water from other things . Some lithium compounds are used to make soap and grease .
Lithium reacts with water , making irritating smoke and heat . It is not as dangerous as the other alkali metals . Lithium hydroxide is very corrosive .
There are 5 isotopes of Lithium having respectively 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 neutrons in the nucleus . The most common isotope in nature is 3Li7 which makes up 92.58 % of the total . The second isotope which is widely available is 3Li6 which makes up 7.42 % of the total . The other 3 isotopes exist in very small quantities . The atomic mass of Lithium is 6.939 .
Bob Dylan is one of the most famous and successful popular singers of the last 40 years . His birth name was Robert Zimmerman , but he legally changed his last name to Dylan .
He was born in 1941 in Minnesota . As a youth he was a big fan of rock and roll , and formed several bands in high school . However , Dylan first became famous as a folk musician . In 1962 , he released his first album , simply called Bob Dylan . The next year , he released the folk song `` Blowin ' in the Wind '' , which became very popular . In 1965 , he began playing rock and roll . That year , Dylan released `` Like a Rolling Stone '' , which has been called the greatest popular music song of all time . He put these two types of music together in a new way , which became very popular .
The next year , Dylan was in a motorcycle crash which broke his neck . His recovery took many months , and he released no new music or records during this time . Dylan re-examined his life while he recovered , saw what other musicians were doing , and made changes to his own style . His comeback album , John Wesley Harding , was different from his earlier work . While he made many tours to perform during the mid-1960s , he made very few public appearances until the mid-1970s .
Dylan later became a Christian , then drifted away from Christianity , even re-exploring Judaism , which his family followed . Now , he does not want to talk about his religion . Since the 1980s , he has concentrated on touring .
Also , Dylan is one of the famous people who appear on the cover of The Beatles 's Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band .
Vampires are monsters in legends and stories . The first vampire legends were told in Eastern Europe , but much of how modern people see vampires was created by Bram Stoker in the famous novel , Dracula . Few people believe that vampires are real , but they are still very popular in movies , television , and books .
Vampires were once people but have a supernatural curse . Some vampires must drink blood to survive . They do this by biting people or animals on the neck with their two long fangs . People who are killed by having their blood drank by vampires may also become vampires . Others can live off the life energy of people . In many stories , vampires can change into other animals , usually bats , though also wolves , cats or rats .
Dracula is the most famous vampire in fiction , and several movies have been made about him . There is also a popular series of books by Anne Rice about vampires . The television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer featured a young girl who fought vampires , but also befriended good ones . The series Twilight by Stephenie Meyer is also about vampires . The movie The Lost Boys was about a band of vampires in -LRB- then -RRB- modern California . Among many other stories , shows and movies about vampires .
In stories , garlic is often used for keeping vampires away . A branch of wild rose and hawthorn plant are said to hurt vampires , and in Europe , putting mustard seeds on the roof of a house was said to keep them away . Though this is not traditional , mirrors have been used to make vampires stay away -LRB- in some cultures , vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not have a shadow , perhaps as a way of showing that they do not have souls -RRB- . Not all vampires in stories have this quality -LRB- the Greek vrykolakas\/tympanios had both reflections and shadows -RRB- , was used by Bram Stoker in Dracula .
Some neurolgists believe that rabies might lie at the base of the myth .
The problem with this is that rabid people , especially in advanced stages of the disease , will live for about ten days , at best . This does not account for them getting out of ditches and graves over weeks or months .
Another explanation was given by other people . The disease might be porphyria , rather than rabies . Porphyria is a genetic condition that leads to differences when the body makes blood . Some parts of the blood can not be made in sufficient quantities .
Psychological disorders can contribute to vampiric behavior . As well as the fact that drinking blood has always been believed to give you the strength of the one you drink from . That belief stems all the way back to ancient civilizations .
There are people in the real world who like to dress and behave like a vampire . Some of them may also drink blood .
Finally , there is the vampire bat .
Chlorous acid is a chemical compound . It is an acid . Its chemical formula is HClO2 . It contains chlorite ions . It is not stable . It easily disproportionates to hypochlorous acid and chloric acid . It is a strong oxidizing agent . Chlorites are made by reacting chlorous acid with a base . They are more stable . It can be made by reacting barium chlorite with sulfuric acid . This makes insoluble barium sulfate and chlorous acid .
Twelve is a number . It comes between eleven and thirteen , and is an even number . It is divisble by 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 . Its ordinal is 12th -LRB- twelfth -RRB- . Its Roman numeral is XII . It is a duodecimal number . Twelve is also the number of monkeys in a Bruce Willis movie .

James II of England\/VII of Scotland -LRB- 14 October 1633-16 September 1701 -RRB- became King of Scots , King of England , and King of Ireland on 6 February 1685 , and Duke of Normandy on 31 December 1660 . He was the last Roman Catholic king of Scotland , England , or Ireland . Some of his citizens did not like his religious ideas , leading a group of them to disobey and fight against him . This was called the Glorious Revolution because no one was killed . He was not replaced by his Roman Catholic son , James Francis Edward , but by his Protestant daughter and son-in-law , Mary II and William III -LRB- William II of Scotland -RRB- , who became rulers in 1689 .
The belief that James , not William III or Mary II , was the one true ruler became known as Jacobitism -LRB- from Jacobus or Iacobus , Latin for James -RRB- . James made one serious attempt to recover his throne when he landed in Ireland in 1689 . After his defeat at the Battle of the Boyne in the summer of 1690 , he returned to France , living the rest of his life under the protection of King Louis XIV . His son James Francis Edward Stuart -LRB- The Old Pretender -RRB- and his grandson Charles Edward Stuart -LRB- The Young Pretender and Bonnie Prince Charlie -RRB- attempted to restore the Jacobite line after James 's death , but failed .
The issue listed are the children of James II who survived into adulthood . Illegitimate are not listed .

Mass Transit Railway or MTR -LRB- in Chinese , é æ é è æ é å å , literally `` Hong Kong Railway Company '' ; or æ é for short -RRB- is the main rapid transit railway system in Hong Kong . Since the MTR service first opened in 1979 , the network has grown to 150 stations . . Built and run by MTR Corporation Limited , the MTR system is a very popular mode of public transport in Hong Kong , with around 2.46 million passengers riding each day .
The price of using MTR is very low . For example , the price of going from Tsing Yi to Causeway Bay by taxi is around HK$ 200 . Travelling the same distance by MTR costs HK$ 11.80 for grown up people and HK$ 5.40 for young and very old people . People can buy a one way ticket or a Octopus card to enter MTR . Octopus card is a contact-less smart card .
Hong Kong 's growing economy caused a lot of traffic problems . Hong Kong government made a study of these problems . The first line was opened in 1979 . The MTR was popular quickly with the people of Hong Kong , so later they built more lines to cover more ground . People are still arguing about how and where to expand the MTR network next .
During the 1960s , the government of Hong Kong thought they need to accommodate increasing road traffic that growing Hong Kong 's economy would bring . British transport consultants Freeman , Fox , Wilbur Smith & Associates were appointed to study the transport system of Hong Kong . The consultants released the Hong Kong Mass Transport Study in September 1967 , which proposed the construction of a mass transport underground railway system in Hong Kong .
In 1970 , an underground network with four lines was laid out and planned as part of the British consultants ' new report , Hong Kong Mass Transit : Further Studies . The four lines were to be the Kwun Tong Line , Tsuen Wan Line , Island Line , and East Kowloon Line . However , the lines that were eventually constructed were somewhat different compared with the lines that were originally proposed by the `` Hong Kong Mass Transport Study '' .
In 1972 , the Hong Kong government authorised construction of the Initial System , a 20-km system that roughly translates to the Kwun Tong Line today -LRB- except the line now extends to Tiu Keng Leng -RRB- . Negotiations with four major construction consortia started in 1973 . The government 's intention was to tender the entire project , based on the British design , as a single tender at a fixed price . A consortium from Japan signed an agreement to construct the system in early 1974 , but in December of the same year it pulled out from the agreement , stemming from fears of the Arab oil crisis .
Several weeks later , in early 1975 , a government agency known as the Mass Transport Provisional Authority was established to take charge of the project . It announced that the Initial System would be slightly reduced to 15.6 kilometres , and renamed it the Modified Initial System . Plans for a single contract were also abandoned in favor of 25 engineering contracts and 10 electrical and mechanical contracts .
In addition , the government-owned Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway Corporation -LRB- MTRC -RRB- was established to replace the Mass Transport Provisional Authority . -LRB- This was the company succeeded by the MTR Corporation Limited on 30 June 2000 -RRB-
Construction of the Modified Initial System -LRB- now part of Kwun Tong Line and Tsuen Wan Line -RRB- commenced in November 1975 . After almost four years , the northern section was completed on 30 September 1979 . On 1 October 1979 , the northern section was opened , with trains running from Shek Kip Mei to Kwun Tong . The route from Tsim Sha Tsui to Shek Kip Mei was opened in December of the same year .
In 1980 , the first harbor crossing was made by an MTR train as the Kwun Tong Line was extended even farther to Chater station , now known as Central station . To deal with increasing patronage , trains were also extended to six cars .
The government approved construction of the in 1977 , then known as Tsuen Wan Extension , and works commenced in November 1978 . The project added a 10.5-kilometre section to the MTR system , from Prince Edward to Tsuen Wan . The line started service on 10 May 1982 with a total cost of construction -LRB- not adjusted for inflation -RRB- at HK$ 4.1 billion .
When service of this line started , the section of the Kwun Tong Line from Chater to Argyle , present-day Mong Kok station , was transferred to the Tsuen Wan Line . Thus , Waterloo became the terminus of the Kwun Tong Line , and both Argyle and Prince Edward stations became interchange stations . This change was made because system planners expected traffic of the Tsuen Wan Line would exceed that of the Kwun Tong Line . This forecast proved quite accurate , necessitating a bypass from the northwestern New Territories to Hong Kong Island . Launched in 1998 , the Tung Chung Line serves exactly that purpose .
Although land acquisitions were made for a station at Tsuen Wan West , the station was never built . This is not to be confused with Tsuen Wan West Station on KCR West Rail , which lies on the newly reclaimed area near the former ferry pier .
It is interesting to note that since the line 's opening in 1982 , this is the only line whose alignment has virtually remained the same for the past 23 years . For example , the Kwun Tong Line 's alignment has changed for 2 times since its opening - the taking over of Tsuen Wan Line from Mong Kok to Central , and the taking over of Eastern Harbour Crossing section by the Tseung Kwan O Line .
Government approvals were granted for construction of the in December , 1980 . Construction commenced in October , 1981 . On 31 May 1985 the Island Line was opened with service between Admiralty and Chai Wan stations . Both Admiralty and Central stations became interchange stations with the Tsuen Wan Line . Furthermore , each train was extended to eight cars .
On 23 May 1986 , service reached Sheung Wan station . Construction for this station was delayed for one year as government offices which sat on top of the station had to be removed to a new location before construction could start .
In 1984 , the government approved the construction of the Eastern Harbour Crossing , a tunnel to be used by cars and MTR trains . The Kwun Tong Line was extended across the harbor to Quarry Bay , which became an interchange station for the Kwun Tong Line and the Island Line . The extension was launched on 5 August 1989 . An intermediate station , Lam Tin , started operations on 1 October 1989 .
The decision was made in October 1989 to construct a new international airport at Chek Lap Kok on Lantau Island to replace the overcrowded Kai Tak International Airport . The government invited the MTR to build a train line , then known as the Lantau Airport Railway , to the airport . But construction did not begin until the Chinese and British governments settled their financial and land disagreements in November 1994 .
In the end , the new line was included in the financing plans of the new Hong Kong International Airport as the airport was not considered viable without direct public transport links . Construction costs were also shared by the MTR which was granted many large-scale developments in the construction plans for the new stations .
The Lantau Airport Railway turned into two MTR lines , the Tung Chung Line and the Airport Express . The was officially opened on 21 June 1998 by Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa , and service commenced the next day . The opened for service on 6 July 1998 along with the new Hong Kong International Airport .
The Airport Express line is the second most popular means of transport to the Hong Kong International Airport . In 2005 , 22 % of the commuters took the Airport Express to and from the airport .
The Quarry Bay Congestion Relief Works involved extending the Hong Kong Island end of the Kwun Tong Line from Quarry Bay to North Point via a 4.2 kilometre tunnel . The project was initiated due to overcrowding at Quarry Bay and persistent passenger complaints about the 5-minute walk from the Island Line station to the Kwun Tong Line station . Construction began in September 1997 and was completed in September 2001 at a cost of HK$ 3.0 billion .
Construction of the was approved on 18 August 1998 to serve new housing developments . Construction began on 24 April 1999 and the line officially opened in 2002 . It took over the train tracks running through the Eastern Harbour Tunnel from the Kwun Tong Line , and ran from Po Lam to North Point . When the line was opened , the Kwun Tong Line was diverted to Tiu Keng Leng on the new line . The Government paid part of the cost for this construction , and the money came also from private developers which linked construction of the Tseung Kwan O Line to new real estate and commercial developments . Previously under-developed areas were opened up for development with more transport options .
While the construction of the Tung Chung Line was still underway , the plan for building a railway corridor to serve the northwestern New Territories was conceived . Space has been reserved for the addition of an interchange station and two extra tracks -LRB- to allow non-stop service for the Airport Express -RRB- between Olympic and Lai King . Originally known as the Airport Railway Phase 2 , the contracts of the West Rail Interface Works were awarded shortly after construction works of the West Rail commenced . The project comprised Mei Foo Interchange -LRB- modification of the existing Mei Foo station on the Tsuen Wan Line to provide a pedestrian link to the West Rail Mei Foo station ; Nam Cheong Station -LRB- an interchange station on the Tung Chung Line , jointly operated by the MTRC and KCRC -RRB- and 4-Tracking Works -LRB- the additional two tracks , 4 km in length , allow the Tung Chung Line trains to stop at Nam Cheong without obstructing the passage of Airport Express trains -RRB- .
The Works were completed in stages . The Tung Chung Line trains have been running on the new track since mid May 2003 , whereas the Mei Foo station interchange subway and the Nam Cheong station were opened at the same time the West Rail opened for public use in December 2003 .
Two major works have been undertaken to improve interchange between MTR and KCR East Rail . The modification of Kowloon Tong station started in June 2001 . A new pedestrian link to East Rail Kowloon Tong station southern concourse and a new entrance were completed in June 2003 to cope with the increase in interchange passenger flow .
Modification to MTR Tsim Sha Tsui Station involved in upgrading station factilities and concourse layout to facilitate access from the pedestrian links of East Rail East Tsim Sha Tsui station . New entrances to the subway links were opened on 19 September 2004 -LRB- for KCR Mody Road subway -RRB- and 30 March 2005 -LRB- for Nathan Road subway , which connects to KCR Middle Road subway -RRB- , with the whole scheme completed in May 2005 .
, previously known as Penny 's Bay Rail Link , provides service to the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort which was opened on 12 September 2005 . Service to Sunny Bay station on the Tung Chung Line started on 1 June 2005 . The new line and Disneyland Resort station opened for service on 1 August 2005 .
This 3.5 km single-track railway is an extension of the Tung Chung Line . It runs between Sunny Bay station to Disneyland Resort station , which is designed to blend in with the Hong Kong Disneyland to create a resort ambience . The line currently operates two four-car fully-automated trains -LRB- each car accommodating up to 180 passengers -RRB- running every four to ten minutes . These carriages were converted from the existing rolling stock to suit the recreational and adventurous nature of the 3.5 minute journey .
The new Asia World-Expo station is an extension of the Airport Express to serve the new international exhibition center , known as the AsiaWorld-Expo at Hong Kong International Airport . The station opened on 20 December 2005 to meet the opening of the exhibition center . To cope with the projected increase in patronage , Airport Express trains has expanded from 7 cars to 8 cars . Additional trains will also be deployed on the Tung Chung line during major exhibitions and events .
On 5 October 2000 the operator of the MTR network , MTR Corporation Limited , became Hong Kong 's first privatised rail and metro company , which marked the start of the Hong Kong government 's planned initiative to wind down its interests in various public utilities . Prior to its listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange , the Mass Transit Railway Coporation was wholly owned by the Hong Kong Government . The offering involved the sale of around one billion shares , and the company now has the largest shareholder base of any company listed in Hong Kong . In June , 2001 , MTR Corporation Limited was transferred to Hang Seng Index .
MTR Corporation Limited has always been reliant on developing properties next to railway stations for its profits -LRB- although the rail lines are profitable themselves -RRB- ; many recently built stations are incorporated into large housing estates or shopping complexes . Examples of this type of construction can be seen at Tsing Yi station , which is built next to the Maritime Square shopping center , and directly underneath the Tierra Verde housing estate .
On April 11 , 2006 , MTR Corporation Limited signed a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding with the Hong Kong Government , the owner of Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation -LRB- KCRC -RRB- , to merge the operation of the two railway networks of Hong Kong . If eventually approved , MTR Corporation Limited will take over the operation of the KCR network and combine the fare system of the two networks .
Various campaigns and activities are taken to help ensure that the MTR is a safe system to travel on . Poster campaigns displaying information on topics such as escalator safety are a common sight in all MTR stations , and announcements are made regularly as safety reminders to traveling passengers .
Bylaws have been recently introduced to deter potentially dangerous actions on the MTR , such as the ban of flammable goods on the MTR and rushing into trains when the doors are closing . Penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment have been imposed for such offenses . Metallic balloons are also banned due to previous incidents on KCR and on MTR 's Island Line where a metallic balloon interfered with the operation of the overhead power lines .
Police officers patrol on trains and stations , and police posts are available at some stations . The Hong Kong Police Force has a Railway District responsible for the MTR and the KCR . Closed-circuit television cameras are installed in stations .
Tung Chung Line , the Airport Express and Tseung Kwan O Line , except Quarry Bay station , had platform screen doors -LRB- PSDs -RRB- installed upon construction . These doors prevent people from falling onto the rails , and MTRC allowed the assumption that this implementation was primarily a safety campaign , without heavily promoting it directly . In fact , the primary motivation was to separate the stations from the tunnels , hence allowing substantial energy savings on station air-conditioning and tunnel ventilation . Automatic platform gates -LRB- APGs -RRB- have also been installed at the Sunny Bay and Disneyland Resort stations . Their heights are half of the PSDs and only prevent people from falling onto the rails .
In June 2000 , The MTR Corporation proceeded with its plans to retrofit 2,960 pairs of platform screen doors at all 30 underground stations on the Kwun Tong Line , Tsuen Wan Line , and Island Line in a six year program . The program made MTR the world 's first railway to undertake the retrofitting of PSDs on a passenger-carrying system already in operation . A prototype design was first introduced at Choi Hung station in the 3rd quarter of 2001 . HK$ 0.10 per passenger trip was levied on Octopus card users to help fund the HK$ 2 billion retrofit program . The whole installation scheme was completed in October 2005 . The original completion year was 2006 . The MTR Corporation said that part of the cost had to be assumed by passengers .
With the high level of daily passenger traffic , facilities of MTR stations are built with durability and accessibility in mind . The elevators and escalators in stations are heavy duty , with the elevators installed by Otis Elevator Company\/Fujitec and the escalators installed by Constructions Industrielles de la MediterranÃ e and Otis Elevator Company .
After extensive retrofits , the MTR system has become , in general , disabled-friendly -- the trains have dedicated wheelchair space , the stations have special floor tiles to guide the blind safely on the platforms , and there are extra wide entry and exit gates for wheelchairs as well .
Unlike many other metro systems around the world , `` main line '' MTR stations do not have toilet facilities , although their installation has been contemplated . Only stations on the Airport Express and Disneyland Resort Line have access to toilet facilities .
The MTR network is unique in its arrangement of interchange stations . Interchange stations between the Island , Tsuen Wan , Kwun Tong and Tseung Kwan O lines are arranged in pairs ; such an arrangement allows cross-platform interchange wherein a passenger leaves a train on one side of the platform and boards trains on the other side of the platform for another line .
Most of those stations make use of a cross-platform interchange system , where the commuter can change to another line on the opposite platform . For example , when a person is traveling on the Kwun Tong Line towards Tiu Keng Leng , getting off at Yau Tong would allow him to change trains across the platform for the Tseung Kwan O Line towards North Point . Whereas , staying on the train and reaching Tiu Keng Leng would allow you to change trains for the Tseung Kwan O Line towards Po Lam .
This not only makes it more convenient for passengers , it also reduces the amount of traffic per station . Riders are made aware of the closest connection point by way of in-train visual and auditory messages . Although riders can disregard these tips , the design of the stations are for the convenience of passengers .
A full GSM -LRB- GSM-900 and GSM-1800 -RRB- , CDMA and TDMA mobile phone network is in place through out the MTR system of stations and tunnels . Passengers can stay connected underground .
Currently , full 3G network coverage in all stations and tunnels -LRB- except West Rail Line -RRB- for the MTR system has been provided by 3 Hong Kong , SmarTone-Vodafone and PCCW Mobile . Passengers with subscription services will be able to make video calls and access high speed video content on their mobile phones regardless whether the train is above ground or under ground .
Until recently , MTR stations only had branches of the Hang Seng Bank and Maxim 's Cakes stores , owned by Jardine Matheson , and a handful of other shops . Since the privatisation of the MTR , however , numerous shops have been added to certain stations , turning them into miniature shopping centres . Services available at most stations include :
Apart from retailers , there are also dentists and medical clinics , drycleaners , and florists along the Tseung Kwan O Line . Standard services include payphones , vending machines -LRB- Coca-Cola only -RRB- , and self-service photo-booths .
Recruit was the first free magazine which was solely distributed in MTR stations since July 1992 . However , in July 2002 , the contract between the magazine and MTR was terminated . Another recruitment magazine Jiu Jik -LRB- æ è -RRB- , published by South China Morning Post , replaced Recruit as the only free recruitment magazine distributed in MTR stations on every Tuesdays and Fridays .
At the same time , there was another entertainment magazine Hui Kai Guide -LRB- å '' è -- Guide -RRB- . However , it is no longer distributed in MTR stations since 2006 .
The Metropolis Daily -LRB- é 1\/2 å æ -- å -RRB- , published by Metro International , is the first free newspaper distributed free in MTR stations from Monday to Friday -LRB- except public holidays -RRB- ; and in 2005 , there is another weekend newspaper Express Post -LRB- å `` ç å ` å -RRB- , distributed every Saturday except public holidays .

As of January 2005 , there are two different fare classes on the MTR : Adult and concessionary . Only children below the age of 12 , senior citizens 65 years or older , or full-time Hong Kong students between the ages of 12 and 25 qualify for the concessionary rate . Children below the age of 3 travel free .
Similar to some other metro systems in the world , the fare payable by a passenger depends on the approximate distance traveled . However , taking any particular station as the origin , the other stations fall into fare `` zones '' depending on the distance from the origin . The fare to all stations in a `` zone '' is the same and increases with distance , especially if the journey involves a harbor crossing . Adult fares range from HK$ 3.80 to $ 26.00 . Concessionary fares are usually half the adult fare , and range from HK$ 2.40 to $ 13.00 . Fares for the Airport Express Line are significantly higher .
The Octopus card is a rechargeable contactless smart card used in an electronic payment system in Hong Kong . It was launched in September 1997 for use on both the MTR and the KCR and now is the most widely used electronic cash system for transactions in Hong Kong as many retailers are fitted with readers .
The Octopus card uses radio frequency identification -LRB- RFID -RRB- technology so that users need only hold the card in front of the reader . Physical contact is not required , and the card need not even be taken out because the reader can penetrate through material . This fare collection system has been so popular that many cities such as Singapore , London , Chicago , and Taipei have adopted the idea , launching their own version of smart cards , respectively named EZ-link , Oyster card , and EasyCard .
Except for the Airport Express , MTR fares are slightly lower when using an Octopus card compared to using single journey tickets . For example , the cost of the 3-minute journey from Admiralty to Tsim Sha Tsui across the Victoria Harbour is -LRB- as of 2005 -RRB- HK$ 7.9 using the Octopus card , compared with HK$ 9.0 for a single-journey ticket .

All trains are electric multiple units -LRB- EMUs -RRB- , equipped with ATC and ATP , operating on 1432 mm rail gauge . Except for the rolling stock of the Airport Express , all trains are designed with features to cope with high density passenger traffic on stopping services . Examples are the latitudinal seating arrangement , additional ventilation fans and 5 doors on each side per car .
The Tung Chung Line and the Airport Express use dedicated rolling stock designs specified to their respective lines . Initially run in 7-car formations , they have now been lengthened to eight cars . These two variations are built jointly by Adtranz -LRB- now Bombardier Transportations -RRB- and Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles between 1994 â `` 97 .
The other lines are operated using a mixture of the other two variations , known as the `` M-Train '' and the `` K-Stock '' . The `` M-Stock '' -LRB- or CM-Stock '' -RRB- of `` M-Train '' are the oldest trains on the MTR , built originally by Metro Cammell -LRB- now Alstom -RRB- and refurbished by United Goninan . The `` M-Train '' is the only variation that uses sliding doors , as opposed to others which use plug-doors . The `` K-Stock '' are built jointly by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and ROTEM , and a further order of 32 cars is due to be in service on the Tung Chung Line by 2007 .
The Disneyland Resort Line uses driverless `` M-Trains '' with their appearance overhauled to suit the atmosphere and theme of the line .

With the objective `` not only bring MTR passengers more time for life , but also more time for art '' , the `` Art in MTR '' Initiative has been a success since its reception in 1998 , where the Airport Express Artwork Programme was the pioneer project . Thereafter , live performances , art exhibitions , display of artwork by established and emerging artists , students and young children have been brought into the MTR stations . MTR Corporation Limited have even made art part of the station architecture when building new stations or renovating existing ones . Artworks are exhibited in different forms on the network , including `` arttube '' , open art gallery , community art galleries , roving art , living art , and art in station architecture .
By incorporating elements of art into the railway network , the traveling environment for the passengers is not only enhanced , but also makes their journeys even more pleasant and enjoyable . Moreover , with MTR stations being an integral part of the neighborhood , the program also provides opportunities to promote Hong Kong 's community art , encourage art appreciation among the public and give residents a feeling of home at the stations .
MTR Corporation Limited has suggested several future projects to the Hong Kong Government , with some already being built . The network is also set to grow quite much when MTR Corporation Limited joins with the government-owned Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation -LRB- KCRC -RRB- , with the non-binding `` Memorandum of Understanding '' agreement signed on 11 April 2006 to give MTR Corporation control of the KCR network for 50 years . The new Sha Tin to Central Link that was first given to KCRC would now also be run by MTR Corporation Limited , which will run from Tai Wai Station in Tai Wai to Central .
It has also been suggested to improve parts of MTR that are running now . Airport Station on the Airport Express will have a new platform to serve passengers flying out of Hong Kong International Airport 's Skyplaza . New subway links to the stations are also being made , and it has been proposed to lengthen the Tseung Kwan O Line with a branch line to Tseung Kwan O South , and the Kwun Tong Line as far as Whampoa Garden , also linking with the Sha Tin to Central Link expansion .

Xenophanes of Colophon , c. 570 â `` c. 475 BC , was a Greek philosopher , poet , and social and religious critic .
Our knowledge of his views comes from fragments of his poetry , surviving as quotations by later Greek writers . To judge from these , his poetry criticized and satirized a wide range of ideas . This included Homer and Hesiod , the belief in the pantheon of anthropomorphic gods and the Greeks ' veneration of athleticism . He is the earliest Greek poet who claims explicitly to be writing for future generations , creating `` fame that will reach all of Greece , and never die while the Greek kind of songs survives '' .
Xenophanes ' surviving writings display a skepticism that became more commonly expressed during the 4th century BC . He satirized the polytheistic beliefs of earlier Greek poets and of his own contemporaries . `` Homer and Hesiod '' one fragment states , `` have attributed to the gods all sorts of things that are matters of reproach and censure among men : theft , adultery , and mutual deception '' . Sextus Empiricus reported that such ideas were savored by Christian apologists . Xenophanes is quoted , memorably , in Clement of Alexandria , arguing against the conception of gods as fundamentally anthropomorphic : But if cattle and horses and lions had handsor could paint with their hands and create works such as men do , horses like horses and cattle like cattlealso would depict the gods ' shapes and make their bodiesof such a sort as the form they themselves have ... Ethiopians say that their gods are snubnosed and blackThracians that they are pale and red-haired .

Jane Seymour was the child of John Seymour and Margaret Wentworth . She was not educated as much as King Henry 's wives before her , for example , Catherine of Aragon or Anne Boleyn . She could read and write a little but was much better at needlework and managing the house . These were considered much more necessary for women . Jane 's needlework was said to be beautiful and complex . Some of her work was kept till 1652 , where it is recorded to have been given to the Seymour family . After her death , it was noted that Henry was an `` enthusiastic embroiderer '' .
She was a lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon , the first wife of Henry VIII . When Henry divorced his first wife and married Anne Boleyn , Jane continued to be a lady-in-waiting .

Champagnes have different names depending on how much sugar is added . Here is a list of kinds of champagnes from least sweet -LRB- called `` dry '' -RRB- to most sweet -LRB- called `` wet '' \/ `` doux '' -RRB- :
Brut is the most common type of champagne .
Champagne , like all sparkling wines , is carbonated . Because of all the bubbles , champagne is sometimes called bubbly -LRB- ex . `` We 're going to have bubbly at our wedding . '' -RRB-
Champagne can be opened in a way that the cork `` pops '' out and the champagne sprays out in a bubbly foam . Usually this is done only at celebrations . It can be achieved by shaking the bottle before opening it . Normally , care should be taken when opening champagne bottles so that it does not make a mess .

Lucas Cranach the Elder -LRB- 1472 â `` 16 October 1553 -RRB- was a German painter and printmaker in woodcut and engraving . He was born Lucas Sunder at Kronach in upper Franconia .
Early on , Lucas Cranach tried jobs that had something to do with painting . He decorated houses , but mostly made portraits and altar-pieces . He also helped design coins and other things .
His first paintings were still lifes and animals on the walls of the palaces at Coburg and Locha . They were so good that the duke asked Lucas Cranach to make a painting of him . Lucas Cranach painted the duke killing a boar .
Before 1508 he had painted a few altar-pieces for the Castle Church at Wittenberg . Albrecht DÃ 1\/4 rer , Hans Burgkmair and others also worked there . He made many portraits of the duke and his brother John . The best woodcuts and copper-plates were published .
More honor was given to Cranach when he went to the Netherlands in 1509 , and painted the Emperor Maximilian I and the boy who became Charles V later in his life . Until 1508 Cranach signed his works with the initials of his name . In that year the person in charge gave him the snake with wings as a symbol . This symbol was marked on all his pictures after that date .
Lucas Cranach the Elder died on 16 October 1553 at Weimar in Germany . The house in which he lived still stands in the marketplace . He is commemorated as an artist by the Lutheran Church on 6 April .
Cranach 's art in its prime was slightly affected by the art of the Italians , but was also similar to that of the Netherlands and Germans .
As a composer Cranach was not greatly gifted . His concept of the human shape was low ; but he showed some freshness in the contor of incident , though he not unfrequently bordered on coarseness . His copper-plates and woodcuts are the best pieces of his art ; and the earlier they are in date the more apparent is their power . Striking evidence of this is the `` St Christopher '' of 1506 , or the plate of `` Elector Frederick praying before the Madonna '' -LRB- 1509 -RRB- .
His first woodcut -LRB- 1505 -RRB- represents the Virgin and three saints in prayer before a crucifix . Later on he composes the marriage of St Catherine , a series of martyrdoms , and scenes from the Passion .
After 1517 he occasionally draws the old gospel themes , but he also gives style to some of the thoughts of the Reformers . In a picture of 1518 at Leipzig , where a dying man offers `` his soul to God , his body to earth , and his worldly goods to his relations , '' the soul rises to meet the Trinity in heaven , and being saved is clearly shown to depend on faith and not on good works . Again sin and grace become a familiar subject of description in pictures . Adam is observed sitting between John the Baptist and a prophet at the foot of a tree . To the left God brings out the tables of the law , Adam and Eve partake of the forbidden fruit , the serpent is holding his head up high , and punishment takes place in the shape of death and the realm of Satan . To the right , the birth , Crucifixion and Resurrection symbolize achievement , and this is duly impressed on Adam by John the Baptist , who points to the sacrifice of the crucified Saviour . There are two examples of this work in the galleries of Gotha and Prague , both of them dated 1529 .
Cranach had three sons , all artists : John Lucas Cranach , who died at Bologna in 1536 ; Hans Cranach , whose life is obscure ; and Lucas Cranach the younger -LRB- 1515-1586 -RRB- who took over his father 's workshop after his death . He also had a daughter Barbara Cranach , married to Christian BrÃ 1\/4 ck -LRB- Pontanus -RRB- , ancestors of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe .

The word `` fat '' can also mean that someone is obese .
Fat is something found in foods , and it is the most concentrated kind of energy that a human can use . It has 9 kilocalories in one gram . The other two types of energy that humans can use are carbohydrates and proteins . Those each have 4 kilocalories in one gram . The human body uses the fat to make the body bigger . The human eats healthy things like vegetables to nullify -LRB- stop -RRB- or reverse the effects of fat .
Fats can be solid -LRB- firm -RRB- or fluid at room temperature . For example , cooking oil is a type of fluid fat . Butter is a solid fat . Some fats come from animals , others come from plants . Fat from plants is called vegetable fat . Examples of vegetable fats are margarine and vegetable oil . Examples of animal fats are butter , cream and lard .
The different types of fats are saturated , unsaturated and trans fats . Trans fats are created in the food industry by treating other types of fats and giving them a different structure . This happens when oil is hardened to make margarine , for example . Many restaurants also use trans fats for deep-frying food . Trans fats are the most unhealthy fats to eat and can cause heart disease .
Fats are usually not soluble in water , but they can be dissolved in other organic solvents . Fats are triesters of fatty acids and glycerol .
Fat is important for the human body because it gives much energy and helps the body use the vitamins in the food . It is also good for the skin and hair . Olive oil is an especially healthy fat . Many types of fish also contain healthy fat , for example salmon , sardines , herring , and tuna . But if too much fat collects in the body , a person can become too heavy . The energy that fat gives the body must be used up by moving or working . Some vegetables like celery or carrots contribute much less to the bodies fat supply . Though being very important for the human body , it can be harmful in large amounts .

According to the WHO , a drug is a substance that can change how a a living organism works . Food is generally not seen as a drug , even though some foods may have such properties . Most of the time drugs are taken to treat a disease , or other medical condition . An example for such drugs may be Aspirin or Paracetamol , which are usually given to treat fever , as well as certain infections . If such drugs are taken over a longer time , they are usually prescribed by a doctor . Other drugs are taken for fun , because of the effect they have . Some of these drugs taken for fun are better accepted by society than others . Having or taking certain drugs may be illegal , in certain countries .
Drugs that are taken to treat a disease or condition are usually called `` therapeutic '' , drugs that are taken for fun are called `` recreational '' drugs .
Drugs may have other effects than those wanted . Such effects are generally known as side-effects .
Drugs act differently in different amounts . It is therefore important to take the right amount . The amount of the drug taken is called a dose . Aspirin is often prescribed against fever , or as an analgesic . One of the side-effects of Aspirin is that it makes the blood thinner . For this reason , it can also be used to prevent strokes , or heart attacks - in a much lower dose than the one used to treat fever , though .
Taking too much of a drug -LRB- `` too high a dose '' -RRB- can cause sickness or even death . When a doctor says how much of a drug -LRB- the right dose -RRB- to take , only that amount should be taken . It is very important to keep taking the drug until the doctor says to stop because someone can feel better but still be sick . When a doctor says what drug to take , how much of it , and for how long , it is called a prescription . Drugs may cause addiction . Some drugs are illegal because they are very addictive . These drugs are really expensive , too .
Recreational drugs can sometimes be bad for someone 's health even if they make them feel good . Alcohol can also be dangerous if the person drinking it drives a vehicle after drinking . This is called drunk driving . Many countries make this against the law . Common recreational drugs include :
Certain recreational drugs also have uses as a therapeutic drug . Heroin can be used as an analgesic -LRB- a painkiller -RRB- and methamphetamine is used to treat narcolepsy or ADHD . Recreational drugs can be dangerous , certain countries have made it illegal to have or take them outside a medical context . Most of the time , this is because they can be addictive or that they are very dangerous when combined with other drugs . That way , Cannabis-based products are legal in the Netherlands , but illegal in many other countries .
Alcohol and Nicotine are legal almost everywhere , but there are a lot of taxes on the sale of these . In other words , they are expensive to buy . Being expensive to buy because of taxes has two benefits ; one is that the taxes collected from the sale of the drugs goes into helping to pay for assistance the drug user may experience later . A smoker , for example , may develop cancer later in life and need treatment at a place that is granted a certain amount of tax money from the government to keep it operating . Another benefit to the taxing of `` legal '' drugs , is that the high price may stop people from beginning the habit in the first place , which will help them avoid the negative medical or addictive side effects of the drug . In some cases , not everyone is allowed to buy these drugs unless they are a minimal age to do so . The age at which someone is allowed to buy a legal drug is most often decided by the government of a country , state or province , and is usually the age where a person is considered by the law to be an `` adult '' . Some of the most common ages this happens is at 18 , 19 or 21 years of age .
Therapeutic drugs are also called medicinal drugs , medicine , or medication . Doctors will give therapeutic drugs to someone who is ill to make you better . You can buy these drugs at a pharmacy . Some drugs need a prescription to be bought , other drugs do not . Drugs that do not require a prescription are called `` over the counter '' medications . There are lots of these drugs for different illnesses . These include :

When Hera found out she was very angry with Echo . She put a curse on her that meant that she could only speak the last words of other people after she had heard them . It is due to this story that we get the meaning behind the word echo .
After she was cursed , Echo fell in love with Narcissus . Narcissus was very handsome and anybody who saw him always fell in love with him . However , Narcissus had no heart and could not fall in love with anybody . Echo could not speak to Narcissus but wanted to be able to see him . She therefore followed him everywhere , but made sure that he could not see her .
Narcissus got lost and called out `` Is anyone here ? '' . Echo said back `` Here , here , here . '' Narcissus then asked Echo to come out of her hiding place . Echo did so and then told Narcissus that she loved him by hand movements . Narcissus , who was angry that so many people loved him , told Echo that he did not love her .
Echo was very upset and prayed to Aphrodite for death . Aphrodite granted Echo 's wish , but she liked Echo 's voice so much she kept it alive .
Narcissus also rejected Echo and broke her heart . She then went and haunted valleys and mountainous areas where echoes are able to be heard in all hollow places of the earth .

Literacy means the ability to read and write . Being able to read and write is an important skill in modern societies . Usually , people learn how to read and write at school . People who can read and write are called literate ; those who can not are called illiterate .
According to the United Nations , illiteracy is not being able to write or read a simple sentence in any language . The UN estimated , that in 1998 , about 16 % of the world 's population were illiterate .
Illiteracy is highest amongst the states of the Arab peninsula , and in Africa , around the Sahara .

Cultural factors also play a part , such as having a culture in which the oral tradition -LRB- communicating by speaking -RRB- is more important than writing .

Jackson County is a county in the U.S. state of Florida . The population as of the 2000 census was 46,755 . As of 2005 , the population was 48,985 . Its county seat is Marianna , Florida .
Jackson County was created by the Florida Territorial Council in 1822 by splitting from Escambia County , making it the third county in the Territory . The county was named for Andrew Jackson , who had served as Florida 's first military governor for six months in 1821 . Jackson County originally spread from the Choctawhatchee River on the west to the Suwannee River on the east . The county had been shrunk close to its current boundaries by 1840 through the creation of new counties from its original land . Small changes to the county border continued through most of the 19th century , however .
There were no towns in Jackson County when it was formed . The first county court met at what was called `` Robinson 's Big Spring '' -LRB- later called Blue Springs -RRB- in 1822 and then at the `` Big Spring of the Choctawhatchee '' in 1823 . The following year the county court met at `` Chipola Settlement '' which is also known as Waddell 's Mill Pond .
Marianna became the county seat , but not without controversy . It was founded by Robert Beveridge , a native of Scotland , in September 1827 . The first town established in Jackson County was Webbville in January 1827 . Webbville , a community of land squatters , was located 9 m northwest of present day Marianna and was named the county seat . Webbville thrived until 1828 when Beveridge and other Marianna settlers went to Tallahassee and enticed the Florida Legislature with free land , construction of a courthouse , a public square and $ 500 to purchase a quarter section of land to be sold at public auction as a way to finance the new government , if the county seat was moved to Marianna .
Beveridge and his supporters succeeded and Marianna became the county seat of the county justice and civil authority , even though it was never officially named the county seat . Marianna began to grow and prosper when the county government moved into the new courthouse in 1829 . Webbville 's important citizens moved to Marianna and the L&N Railroad decided to bypass the town .

Singapore is also known for Singlish , or Singaporean English , which is English mixed with some words from Malay and other local languages . The government runs a campaign against Singlish as this language is being spoken badly about by people from other countries .
Singapore got its name from ` Singa Pura ' which means Lion City . There are many different stories that people use to explain where this name came from . One popular -LRB- famous -RRB- legend has it that a Sumatran prince called Sang Nila Utama landed on Temasek -LRB- Singapore 's old name -RRB- and saw a Lion which is called ` Singa ' in Malay . Thus he gave the island a new name , ` Singapura ' . There were also many pieces of past items that showed that Temasek was a trading port even before the British came in and took over the island .
Singapore was set up as a British trading town in 1819 by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles , and became an important town in the Malay Archipelago , and became `` Singapore '' . The country was given colony rank in 1867 .
When Raffles landed in Singapore , he paid the then Sultan a sum of money for a piece of land in the South of Singapore . In August 1824 , Dr. John Crawfurd signed a treaty with the Sultan for control over the whole island .

The British decided to surrender to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 at the Ford Motor Factory . People of Singapore went through hard times during the Japanese rule until the surrender of the Japanese in September 1945 back to the British . This was called the Japanese occupation .
Many people were injured by the Japanese as they did not follow the rules properly , or are suspected of going against the Japanese . Many people who suffered are usually to give entertainment for the Japanese .

American Robins that live in western North America are very pale -LRB- pale means light in color -RRB- . American Robins that live in eastern Canada are very bright . They have a white throat . It has black stripes in it . Females have lighter gray-brown heads than males . They also have lighter orange-red breasts . A young American Robin -LRB- called a juvenile -RRB- is also lighter than the male . It has dark spots on its breast . Both sexes are 20 â `` 28 cm -LRB- 7.9 â `` 11 in -RRB- long . They have a wingspan of 31 â `` 40 cm -LRB- 12.2 â `` 15.7 in -RRB- . American Robins that live in western North America are very pale . American Robins that live in eastern Canada are very bright .
The American Robin was named after the European Robin . This is because the European Robin has a bright orange-red face and breast . The two species are not closely related .
The American Robin has seven subspecies . They are very hard to tell apart . The different subspecies will breed with each other .
The American Robin can be found all over North America . It is found from Alaska and Canada south to Mexico . Most American Robins winter in Florida and the Gulf States to Mexico to the Pacific Coast . They will sometimes winter in southern Canada and the northern United States .
The American Robin is a rare vagrant to western Europe . Most of the American Robins have been found in Britain . The most recent sighting of an American Robin in Britain was in January 2007 . It has also been a vagrant to Greenland , Jamaica , Hispaniola , Puerto Rico , and Belize .
American Robins are found in many different kinds of habitats . Some of them are gardens , parks , yards , fields , pastures , tundra , woodlands , pine forests , and shrublands . They like open areas of ground to feed . They like areas with trees or shrubs to breed and sleep .
The American Robin has a large range . It is estimated that its range is 16 million square kilometers -LRB- 6 million square miles -RRB- . It is also estimated that there are about 320 million individual American Robins . The IUCN Red List says that the species is not believed to reach the threat of decline . It is therefore considered Least Concern .
American Robins used to be killed for their meat . They were killed in the southern states . The meat was thought as a very good food . The American Robin is now protected in the United State by the Migratory Bird Act .
The American Robin is most active during the day . During the winter , it groups together in large flocks at night . They sleep together in thick vegetation . During the day , these large winter flocks break up into smaller flocks . They feed in these smaller flocks . During the summer , American Robins are less social . This is because they are defending their breeding territories .
Juvenile Robins spend their first four months of life near their nesting place . They then flock together with other American Robins before they migrate to their wintering places .
The American Robin eats invertebrates . In the spring , they like to eat earthworms and snails . Some other invertebrates that American Robins eat are beetles , grubs , and caterpillars . It will also eat fruits and berries . Some kinds of berries that they like to eat are chokecherries , hawthorn berries , dogwood berries , sumac fruits , and juniper berries .
The American Robin begins to breed shortly after returning to northern North America after spending the winter in the south . It is one of the first North American birds to lay eggs . It has two to three broods -LRB- a brood is a group of offspring -RRB- each breeding season . The breeding season starts in April and ends in July . It is one of the first birds to sing at dawn . Its song is made up of several small groups of sounds that are repeated .
The female chooses where to make the nest . She will usually make the nest on one or many branches that are hidden in leaves . In the west , the female will make the nest on the ground or in thickets . In Alaska , the female will make the nest on a cliff . The female makes the nest . She starts with the inside . She uses grass and sticks to make a cup-shaped center . Other things that the female will use are paper , feathers , rootlets , and moss . After the center is done , she uses mud on the outside of the nest to make it stronger . She then puts soft grass in the cup . The nest is usually 15.2 to 20.3 cm -LRB- 6 to 8 in -RRB- long . It is 7.6 to 15.2 cm high -LRB- 3 to 6 in -RRB- .
The female will lay 3 to 5 eggs in the nest . They are blue or blue-green . They are 2.8 to 3cm -LRB- 1.1 to 1.2 in -RRB- long . They are 2.1 cm -LRB- 0.8 in -RRB- wide . Only the female incubates the eggs -LRB- incubate means that the adult will sit on the eggs and keep them warm and help the babies inside grow -RRB- . It takes 12 to 14 days for the eggs to hatch .
For the first few days , the chicks have no feathers and their eyes are closed . The young live in the nest for about 13 days . As the chicks grow older , the female will protect them only at night and during bad weather . After the juveniles leave the nest , they will follow their parents around and beg them for food .
Both parents help feed and protect the fledged -LRB- fledged means a young bird that has just learned how to fly -RRB- juveniles until they can live on their own . The adults will give an alarm call to warn the juveniles that there is a predator near by . The parents will then attack the predator . Some of the predators they will attack are cats and dogs . They will even go after humans if the human gets close to their young . Fledged juveniles are only able to fly short distances . The coloring of the juveniles helps them hide better in bushes or trees . This kind of coloring is called camouflage .
Bird banders have found that only 25 % of juvenile American Robins live through their first year . The average life of an American Robin lasts about 2 years . The longest known lifespan of a wild American Robin is 14 years .
Eggs and juvenile Robins that still live in the nest are eaten by squirrels and snakes . Some birds also eat eggs and juvenile Robins . These birds are Blue Jays , Common Grackles , American Crows , and Common Ravens . The adult American Robin is eaten by hawks , cats , and larger snakes . When feeding together in flocks , American Robins will watch each other for signs of predators . If a predator is seen , they will make a warning call . Sometimes , the Brown-headed Cowbird lays its eggs in the Robin 's nest . This is called brood parasitism . The Robin usually rejects the cowbird eggs . Because of this , brood parasitism by the cowbird is rare .
The American Robin is known to carry a disease called the West Nile Virus . This disease comes from mosquitoes . Crows and jays are the first to die from this disease . The American Robin is more responsible for the transmission of the disease to humans . This is because the American Robin lives longer with the disease than the crows and jays . This allows the American Robin to spread the disease to more mosquitoes which then spread the disease to humans and other animals .
The American Robin is the state bird of Connecticut , Michigan , and Wisconsin . It was also shown on a 1986 Canadian $ 2 note , but it is no longer on the bill .
There is color named after the American Robin 's eggs . It is called Robin 's egg blue .
The Robin is considered a symbol of spring . A good example is a poem by Emily Dickinson . It is called `` I Dreaded That First Robin So '' . There are other poems about the first robin of spring . One of them is `` The First Robin '' by Dr. William H. Drummond . According to the author 's wife , it is based on a Quebec false belief . The belief says that whoever sees the first robin of spring will have good luck .
Chemistry is the science of chemical elements and compounds , and how these things work together . It is the study of the materials -LRB- things -RRB- that make up our bodies and everything in the world around us .
Before 1600 , people studied substances to figure out how to do things like turn lead into gold , but no one managed to do that . This was called alchemy . Alchemists -LRB- people that did alchemy -RRB- did discover some useful things , though . Sulfuric acid and nitric acid were two substances that they discovered .
Only a few elements were known . Some of them are mercury , silver , gold , and carbon .
Chemistry began as a true science during the 1600s . This is when chemists discovered the simplest substances that make up all other substances . These simple substances are called elements . One of the things that they learned is that gold and lead are made of two different elements , so you can not change one into the other by a chemical reaction . The first element discovered after 1600 was phosphorus , a strange white glowing solid .
Elements were discovered more and more rapidly . People separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it . They also processed special minerals from a mine in Sweden to get rare earth metals . Radioactivity was also discovered . Today chemists have discovered 118 different elements . Some are very common , like oxygen . Many are very rare and expensive , like platinum . Some can not be found on earth and can only be made in labs , like rutherfordium .
There are several types of chemistry . Analytical chemistry looks at things to see what chemicals they have in them . A sample job would be to see how much arsenic is in food . Organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them . A sample job would be making acetylene . Inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them . A sample job would be making an integrated circuit .
A large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry . It looks at plastics . A sample job would be making nylon . Because plastics are made of carbon , polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry . Then there is biochemistry . It looks at the chemistry of living things . A sample job would be seeing how arsenic poisons people . Biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry . There are many other small branches of chemistry .
The basic unit of an element is called an atom . An atom is the smallest thing that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down . A chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements . In a compound , the atoms of each element are joined together to form a molecule . The tiniest speck of dust , or drop of liquid , that you can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules . Mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted . An example would be mixing sand and salt . It is just a mixture . If it is put in water , the salt will dissolve , leaving the sand behind . Chemical compounds are broken down by a chemical reaction . An example would be heating sodium bicarbonate , common baking soda . It will make water , carbon dioxide , and sodium carbonate . A mole is a very large amount of atoms -LRB- 602,200,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms -RRB- . The atomic mass of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole . For example , the atomic mass of copper is about 63.55 . That means about 63.55 grams of copper metal has a mole of atoms . The atomic mass of chlorine is about 35.45 . That means 35.45 grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it .
Moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds , too . Copper -LRB- II -RRB- chloride is an example . CuCl2 is its chemical formula . There is one copper atom -LRB- 63.55 -RRB- and two chlorine atoms -LRB- 35.45 Â 2 = 70.90 -RRB- . Add all the molar masses of the elements together and the molar mass of the chemical compound is gotten . -LRB- 63.55 + 70.90 = 134.45 -RRB- That means in 134.45 grams of copper -LRB- II -RRB- chloride , there is one mole of copper -LRB- II -RRB- chloride molecules . This concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants -LRB- chemicals that are reacted -RRB- should be left . If too much reactant is used , there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction .
Acids and bases are common chemicals . Acids release H + ions when in water , and bases release OHâ ' ions when in water . Acids can react with bases . The H + ion is taken from the acid by the base . This makes water , H2O . A salt is also made when an acid and a base react together . An example would be reacting hydrochloric acid -LRB- HCl -RRB- and sodium hydroxide -LRB- NaOH -RRB- . Hydrochloric acid releases H + and Cl - ions in water . The base releases Na + and OH - ions . The H + and the OH - react to make water . There is a solution of sodium chloride -LRB- NaCl -RRB- left . Sodium chloride is a salt .
Chemistry is very common in normal life and makes up the foundation of much of science . Most objects are made by chemists -LRB- people who do chemistry -RRB- . Chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances . Chemists make new drugs and materials like paints that we all use every day .
Although there are some chemicals that are harmless , many chemicals are dangerous . For example , mercury -LRB- II -RRB- chloride is very toxic . Chromates can cause cancer . Tin -LRB- II -RRB- chloride pollutes water easily . Hydrochloric acid can cause bad burns . Some chemicals like hydrogen can explode or catch fire . To stay safe chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab . They use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained . The chemicals used in drugs and in things like bleach have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly .

Neurosarcoidosis is involvement of the brain with Sarcoidosis . It may be treated with Corticosteroids including Prednisone .
Patriotism means loyalty of person to his\/her own nation or the leaders of nation . A patriot is a person who is on the side of his\/her own nation or its leaders . Patriotism is different from nationalism . Nationalist thinks that every ethnic group should have its own nation , so nations are to serve the people . In other words in nationalism the nation is just a tool to have freedom for an ethnic group , while in patriotism the nation itself is the highest value .
A patriot may also be loyal to imperialist or colonialist nations , while nationalism is opposed to imperialism or colonialism .
Count Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta -LRB- 18 February 1745 â `` 5 March 1827 -RRB- was a Lombard physicist known especially for the development of the first electrical cell in 1800 . He was born in Como in Lombardy , Italy .
Volta worked on the electrophorus that makes a static electric charge in 1775 . Volta also studied what we now call capacitance , developing separate means to study both electrical potential V and charge Q , and discovering that for a given object they are proportional . This may be called Volta 's Law of Capacitance , and likely for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the volt . Around 1791 he began to study `` animal electricity '' . In this way he discovered Volta 's Law of the electrochemical series , and the law that the electromotive force -LRB- emf -RRB- of a galvanic cell . In 1800 , He invented the voltaic pile , an early electric battery , which made a steady electric current . It is credited as the first electrochemical cell .
In honor of his work in the field of electricity , Napoleon made him a count in 1810 . A museum in Como , the Voltian Temple , has been built in his honor and exhibits some of the original equipment he used to conduct experiments . In 1881 , an important electrical unit , the volt -LRB- V -RRB- , was named in his honor . There have also been innovations and discoveries named after Alessandro Volta including the Toyota Alessandro Volta , and the Volta Crater on the Moon .
Volta married the daughter of Count Ludovico Peregrini , Teresa , with whom he raised three sons . In 1779 he became professor of experimental physics at the University of Pavia , a chair he occupied for almost 25 years . Volta is buried in the city of Como . At the Tempio Voltiano near Lake Como there is a museum devoted to explaining his work .
An International Standard Serial Number -LRB- ISSN -RRB- is an eight-digit number used to identify a print or electronic periodical publication . The ISSN system was first created known as international standard ISO 3297 in 1975 . The ISO subcommittee TC 46\/SC 9 is responsible for the standard .
Beverly Cleary -LRB- born April 12 , 1916 -RRB- is the author of over 80 books for young adults and children . Her characters are normal children facing challenges of growing up , and her stories are filled with humor . Some of her best known and loved characters are Ramona Quimby and her sister Beatrice -LRB- `` Beezus '' -RRB- , Henry Huggins , Ralph S. Mouse , and Ribsy .
Beverly Cleary was born Beverly Atlee Bunn in McMinnville , Oregon . When she was 6 , her family moved to Portland , Oregon , where she went to grammar and high school . She was slow in learning to read , partly because she did not like the books the school wanted her to read , and partly due to an unkind first grade teacher . It was not until she was in third grade that she found enjoyment from books , when she started reading The Dutch Twins by Lucy Fitch Perkins . From then on , she visited the library often , though she rarely found the books she most wanted to read â '' those about children like herself .
In 1934 , she moved to Ontario , California to attend Chaffey College , from which she earned an Associate of Arts diploma . She then moved to Berkeley to major in English at the University of California . After graduating with a B.A in English in 1938 , she studied at the School of Librarianship at the University of Washington in Seattle , where she earned a degree in librarianship in 1939 . Her first job was as a librarian in Yakima , Washington , where she met many children who were looking for the same books that she had always hoped to find as a child herself . In response , she wrote her first book , Henry Huggins , which was published in 1950 . Beezus and Ramona , Cleary 's first novel to feature the Quimby sisters as the central focus of the story , was published in 1955 , although Beezus and Ramona made frequent appearances in the Henry Huggins series as supporting characters .
In 1940 she married Clarence T. Cleary and they moved to Oakland , California . The Clearys became parents to a set of twins , Marianne Elisabeth and Malcolm James , in 1955 . Clarence Cleary died in 2004 . Beverly Cleary currently lives in Carmel , California .
She has also written two autobiographies , A Girl from Yamhill and My Own Two Feet .
Her books are available in 14 languages in over 20 countries . She has won many awards , including the 1984 Newbery Medal for her book Dear Mr. Henshaw and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award in 1975 . Cleary received the Library of Congress Living Legends award in the `` Writers and Artists '' category in April 2000 for her major contributions to America 's cultural heritage .
The Hollywood location of the Multnomah County library , near where she lived as a child , has created a map on their lobby wall of Henry Huggins ' Klickitat Street neighborhood . Statues of her beloved characters Ramona , Henry Huggins , and the Huggins ' dog Ribsy can be found in Grant Park in Portland , Oregon .
In 2004 , the University of Washington 's Information School completed fundraising for a Beverly Cleary Endowed Chair for Children and Youth Services to remember her work and commitment to librarianship .
She has a dorm at University of California , Berkeley named after her .

Persephone was a Greek goddess of grain and spring . Also sometimes referred to as Caliope . A daughter of Zeus and Demeter . She was kidnapped by Hades and he makes her eat a pomegranate which is the fruit of the underworld . According to some myths , if one were to eat the fruit of the Underworld , they would be forced to stay there . This myth explains why the seasons change . Supposedly , Demeter was so sad over the disappearance of her daughter that she ignored her duties to the world , during this time all plants died . When Demeter went to the Underworld to rescue her Persephone , Hades forced Persephone to eat the pomegranate . After she ate this fruit it was supposed to keep her in the underworld with Hades so she would be forced to marry him . In some versions she only ate 6 seeds from the pomegranate , so Hades only made her stay 6 months of the year . It is during the 6 months that Persephone is with Hades that Demeter weeps , causing all plant life to die -LRB- symbolizing Fall and Winter -RRB- , and during the six months that she is with Demeter life is sustained -LRB- Spring and Summer -RRB- . She does not have a throne on Olympus but her mother let her sit on her lap when Persephone was a child ! The only reason Hades kidnapped her is because he saw her running in a field , and he thought she was beautiful .
The guppy -LRB- Poecilia reticulata -RRB- , also known as the millionfish , is one of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish species in the world . It is a small member of the Poeciliidae family -LRB- females 4 â `` 6 centimetres -LRB- 1.6 â `` 2.4 in -RRB- long , males 2.5 â `` 3.5 centimetres -LRB- 1.0 â `` 1.4 in -RRB- long -RRB- and like all other members of the family , is live-bearing . Guppies are popular aquarium kept fish because of their inexpensive needs and beautiful color ranges .
Vongnes is a commune . It is found in the region RhÃ ne-Alpes in the Ain department in the east of France .
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a 1969 movie from 20th Century Fox . George Roy Hill directed it , and John Foreman produced it . It stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford as two robbers in the American West who go to Bolivia to escape the law .
The movie was loosely based on the real story of the two title characters -LRB- Butch Cassidy and his friend Harry Longabaugh , also called `` Sundance '' -RRB- . But it made the legends of the two more popular .
It won four Academy Awards : for Best Cinematography -LRB- shooting work on a movie -RRB- , Best Original Score , Best Song -LRB- Burt Bacharach 's `` Raindrops Keep Fallin ' on My Head '' -RRB- and Best Original Screenplay -LRB- William Goldman -RRB- . It was also nominated for Best Picture , Best Director -LRB- Hill -RRB- and Best Sound .
It was one of the largest-grossing movies of the 1960s -LRB- with $ 102.3 million in the United States -RRB- . It was number fifty on AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list .
At first , Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen -LRB- even Marlon Brando -RRB- were called upon to play the title roles . When Newman and Redford took their place , the roles were switched , with Newman as Sundance , and Redford as Cassidy . The studio , 20th Century Fox , did not like Redford 's role . But the movie 's director , Hill , wanted it that way .
As a result , Redford has said that the movie made him a more famous actor .
The Sundance Film Festival is named after Redford 's role , as well his Utah ski resort .

Basildon is a town in Essex , England . Basildon was recorded to have a pupulation of 1,159 in 1931 but it was then expanded and became a new town .
Scrambled eggs is a dish made from beaten whites and yolks of eggs -LRB- usually chicken -RRB- . The dish often contains other ingredients . Cream , butter , milk , water or oil -LRB- used in China -RRB- will dilute the egg proteins to create a softer texture .
The eggs and a large piece of butter are put into a saucepan over a low heat . The egg whites and egg yolks are then `` scrambled '' or mixed together . The mixture should be mixed together all the time they are being cooked .
When cooked a little crÃ me frÃ cents iche is added . This is because the eggs will be hot enough to carry on cooking themselves . Adding a cool liquid will stop the eggs from overcooking . Some salt and pepper or other seasoning can be added to taste as well .
In the home the eggs can be mixed together first and then poured into a pan . The crÃ me frÃ cents iche does not need to be added if the eggs will be eaten almost straight away .
Properly made , the eggs should be moist and creamy consistency . If any liquid is coming from the eggs , it means the eggs have been overcook or that the add the vegetables were undercooked .
Using a double boiler or bain-marie means that the heat is constant , and does not to be adjusted to make sure the eggs do not brown or burn . The baine marie method is slower than cooking directly in a pan over a heat but makes it easier to cook the eggs perfectly . The eggs must be taken out of the bain marie when cooked , otherwise they will carry on cooking and spoil .
Scrambled eggs may also be made in a microwave oven by put the ingredients in a glass bowl and cooking for 30 seconds then whisking , then cooking and whisking again until the desired consistency is achieved .
Many things can be added to scrambled eggs . Often the end result can have a different name , for example :
Marigny-en-Orxois is a commune . It is found in the region Picardie in the Aisne department in the north of France .
Monocytes are a type of white blood cell , part of the human body 's immune system . They are usually identified in stained smears by their large two-lobed nucleus . They are a kind of reserve cell which turn into macrophages and immune helper cells called dendritic cells .
Half of all monocytes are stored as a reserve in the spleen ; the rest are circulating or in tissues .
Monocytes are produced by the bone marrow from stem cell precursors called monoblasts . Monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for about one to three days and then typically move into tissues throughout the body . They make up three to eight percent of the leukocytes in the blood .
Monocytes which migrate from the bloodstream to the tissues will then differentiate into macrophages or dendritic cells , which then stay in the tissue . Macrophages are responsible for protecting tissues from foreign substances . They are cells that possess a large smooth nucleus , a large area of cytoplasm and many internal vesicles for processing foreign material .
Monocytes and their macrophage and dendritic cell progeny serve three main functions in the immune system . These are phagocytosis , antigen presentation and cytokine production .
Typically refers to a Monte Carlo method for sampling from a -LRB- target -RRB- distribution that can not be sampled from directly . The method works by sampling from a proposal distribution -LRB- P -LRB- x -RRB- -RRB- , which is ideally similar to the target distribution -LRB- Q -LRB- x -RRB- -RRB- , and weighting each sample by the ratio of the likelihoods at the sampled point : w -LRB- x -RRB- = Q -LRB- x -RRB- \/ P -LRB- x -RRB- .
Alfred Russel Wallace OM , FRS , -LRB- 8 January 1823 â `` 7 November 1913 -RRB- was a British naturalist , explorer , biologist and social activist . He is best known for proposing a theory of natural selection . This was published in 1858 together with Charles Darwin 's idea .
Wallace did extensive natural history exploring . He went first to the Amazon River basin with Henry Walter Bates , and later to Malaya and Indonesia . He wrote books on both these adventures . While in Indonesia he drew the Wallace Line which divides Indonesia into two parts . On one side are animals of Australasia . On the other side are species mostly of Asian origin . He wrote a wonderful book on the distribution of animals .
After a few years of working as a railway surveyor with his brother , Wallace 's life was changed by meeting Henry Walter Bates in Leicester in 1847 .
Wallace and Bates discussed the idea of an expedition to the Amazon . The plan was to defray expenses by sending specimens back to London , where an agent would sell them for a commission . Also , for the travellers to `` gather facts towards solving the problem of the origin of species '' , as Wallace put it in a letter to Bates . The two friends , who were both by now experienced amateur entomologists , met in London to prepare themselves by viewing South American plants and animals in the main collections .
Bates and Wallace sailed from Liverpool in April 1848 , arriving in ParÃ -LRB- now BelÃ m -RRB- at the end of May . For the first year they settled in a villa near the city , collecting birds and insects . After that they agreed to collect independently .
Wallace continued charting the Amazon for four years , collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples , the languages , the geography , flora , and fauna . On 12 July 1852 , Wallace embarked for England on the brig Helen . After twenty-eight days at sea , balsam in the ship 's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship . All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship , most of his collection , were lost . He could only save part of his diary and a few sketches . Wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig Jordeson .
From 1854 to 1862 , age 31 to 39 , Wallace traveled through the Dutch East Indies -LRB- now Malaysia and Indonesia -RRB- , to collect specimens for sale and to study nature . Wallace collected more than 125,000 specimens in the Dutch East Indies -LRB- more than 80,000 beetles alone -RRB- . More than a thousand of them represented species new to science .
His observations of the clear zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the Wallace Line . Bali and Lombok were two islands in the archipelago only 17 miles apart at the widest -LRB- 28 km -RRB- , roughly the same size and with the same climate , soil , elevation and aspect . Yet their flora and fauna were so different .
`` In this archipelago there are two distinct faunas rigidly circumscribed , which differ as much as do those of Africa and South America ... yet there is nothing on the map or on the face of the islands to mark their limits . The boundary line passes between islands closer together than others belonging to the same group . I believe the western part to be a separated portion of continental Asia , while the eastern is a fragmentary prolongation of a former west Pacific continent .
Why was it , he wondered , that the animals and plants on the Bali side of the channel were of Asian types , while those on the Lombok side were Australasian in type ? This had to mean that the western group had evolved from common western stock , while the eastern group had evolved from a common eastern stock .
While he was exploring the archipelago , he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection . In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin ; it was published , along with a description of Darwin 's own theory , in the same year .
Accounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as The Malay Archipelago . It became one of the most popular natural history travel journals of the 19th century . It was praised by Charles Darwin and Charles Lyell and by others , such as the novelist Joseph Conrad , who called it his `` favorite bedside companion '' .
Unlike Darwin , Wallace began his career as a traveling naturalist already believing in evolution . Both he and Bates had read Vestiges , a controversial work of popular science , published anonymously in 1844 . This advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system , the earth , and living things . He also read Malthus 's Principle of population , which he says `` twenty years later gave me the long-sought clue to the effective agent in the evolution of organic species '' . He meant by that the struggle for existence , which led Wallace to natural selection .
Wallace wrote his ideas on the small isle of Ternate , in what was then the Dutch East Indies . He was suffering from malaria . While the natives looked after him , his thoughts turned to Malthus 's book . `` I thought of -LRB- Malthus 's -RRB- clear exposition of the ` positive checks to increase ' â `` disease , accidents , wars , famine â `` which keep down the population ... It then occurred to me that the same causes , or their equivalents , are continually acting in the case of animals also ... Why do some die and some live ? And the answer came clearly , that on the whole the best fitted live ... Then it suddenly flashed upon me , that this self-acting process would necessarily improve the race ... '' This was the origin of his letter to Darwin , which set out the idea of natural selection .
In 1864 , Wallace published a paper , The origin of human races and the antiquity of Man deduced from the theory of natural selection , applying the theory to human beings . Huxley had already published his view that evolution applied to mankind as it did to other living things .
Wallace thought that natural selection could not account for mathematical , artistic , or musical genius , as well as metaphysical musings , and wit and humor . He eventually said that something in `` the unseen universe of Spirit '' had interceded at least three times in history . The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter . The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals . And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in mankind . He also believed that the purpose of the universe was the development of the human spirit .
Many , including Huxley , Hooker , and Darwin himself , were highly critical of these ideas . As one historian of science has pointed out , Wallace 's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of Darwinism . These are : evolution does not have a goal , and it is not aimed at or centered around mankind . It is thought by most biographers that his thinking on the evolution of man was influenced by his adoption of spiritualism , which happened at the same time .
Wallace was not a believer in revealed religion of any kind , but he did believe in spiritualism . This has puzzled biographers , who struggle to think why such a man would believe in spirits . Early in his life , he experimented with hypnosis , which was then doubted and criticised . He used some of his students in Leicester as subjects , with considerable success . Apparently , this persuaded him not to reject ideas which were doubted . Even when Huxley told him that one of his favorite mediums was a proven fraud , he refused to believe it . He preferred the evidence of his own experience .
Wallace 's public support of spiritualism , and his defense of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud , damaged his scientific reputation . It strained his relationships with friends such as Bates , Huxley and Darwin , who felt he was overly credulous . Others became openly hostile to Wallace over the issue . Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism were subject to much criticism from the press , with The Lancet , the leading English medical journal , being particularly harsh . The controversy affected the public 's idea of Wallace for the rest of his career , though he was always respected in other ways .
Wallace had a wide range of interests , and wrote books about all of them . He wrote against vaccination , for phrenology , for spiritualism , for land nationalisation , against the moon having canals , and for social change and the progress and improvement of mankind . He did not believe in religion , but he did believe in spiritualism . He was a radical in politics , economics and social reform . He was a kind and honorable person , but he could be a tough opponent if he thought something unfair was going on . Even the titles of some of his books were sensational , as for example :
Wallace wrote about 22 books , depending on how one counts them .

The waveform is the shape of a wave as it travels . There are many different waveforms . They are usually a shape which is repeated over and over -LRB- a `` periodic waveform '' -RRB- . A common waveform is the sine wave . It is normally not possible to see a waveform without some device .
The amplitude of a waveform may change a lot . Even though it changes , the waveform has a root mean square -LRB- rms -RRB- value . For example : in the UK , the AC mains supply is a sine wave and has a voltage of 240 V. This is an rms voltage . The actual voltage varies :
The amplitude of the sine wave keeps changing from -339.4 V to +339.4 V.
Root mean square is important . It lets us work out many useful things , like power and heating in a wire .

The California State University -LRB- CSU -RRB- is a public university system established in 1857 in California . It is one of three public higher education systems in the state , the other two being the University of California system and the California Community College system . The California State University system headquarters are located in Long Beach , California .
The CSU system is composed of 23 campuses and has over 417,000 students supported by 47,000 faculties and staff . It is the largest senior system of higher education in the United States .
CSU prepares about 60 percent of the teachers in the state , 40 percent of the engineering graduates , and more graduates in business , agriculture , communication studies , health , education and public administration than all other California universities and colleges combined . Altogether , about half the bachelor 's degrees and a third of the master 's degrees awarded annually in California are from the CSU .
Since 1961 , nearly 2.5 million alumni have received a bachelor 's , master 's or doctoral degree from the CSU system which offers more than 1,800 degree programs in 240 subject areas .
Galmudug is a secular , decentralized state in the central region of Somalia . The administrative capital , South Galcayo , is based in the southern half of the city and district of Gaalkacyo . To the north is Puntland , to the west is Ethiopia and to the south and east is the rest of Somalia , presently under the control of the Transitional Federal Government -LRB- TFG -RRB- . The name is a combination of Galguduud and Mudug . Unlike the secessionist Somaliland region in northwestern Somalia , Galmudug , like the northern Somali region of Puntland , is not trying to obtain international recognition as a separate nation . It considers itself a federal division within the larger federal republic of Somalia , such as defined by the 2004 Transitional Federal Charter -LRB- TFG -RRB- .
Nuclear energy policy is a national and international policy concerning some or all aspects of nuclear energy , such as mining for nuclear fuel , extraction and processing of nuclear fuel from the ore , electricity generation by nuclear power , enriching and storing spent nuclear fuel and nuclear fuel reprocessing . Since nuclear energy and nuclear weapons technologies are closely related , military aspirations can act as a factor in energy policy decisions . The fear of nuclear proliferation influences some international nuclear energy policies .
The use of nuclear energy is limited to a relatively small number of countries in the world . As of 2007 , only 31 countries , or 16 % of the 191 United Nations Member States , operated nuclear power plants . Countries that rely most on nuclear energy were France -LRB- with 75 % of its electricity generated by nuclear power stations -RRB- , Lithuania , Belgium , Bulgaria , Slovakia and Sweden , Ukraine and South Korea . The largest producer of nuclear capacity was the USA with 28 % of worldwide capacity , followed by France -LRB- 18 % -RRB- and Japan -LRB- 12 % -RRB- . In 2000 , there were 438 commercial nuclear generating units throughout the world , with a total capacity of about 351 gigawatts .
Following the 2011 Fukushima I nuclear accidents , China , Germany , Switzerland , Israel , Malaysia , Thailand , United Kingdom , and the Philippines are reviewing their nuclear power programs . Indonesia and Vietnam still plan to build nuclear power plants . Countries such as Australia , Austria , Denmark , Greece , Ireland , Luxembourg , Portugal , Israel , Malaysia , New Zealand , North Korea , and Norway remain opposed to nuclear power .
Australia produces no nuclear power . Plans to review whether the country should develop nuclear power were abandoned after Kevin Rudd , who opposed the move , was elected prime minister in 2007 .
As of 2006 , Finland 's nuclear power program has four nuclear reactors . The first of these came into operation in 1977 . They now provide 27 % of Finland 's electricity .
The third Olkiluoto reactor will be the new European Pressurized Reactor . Scheduled to go on line in 2011 , it will have a power output of 1600 MWe .
Construction of Olkiluoto 3 started in August 2005 . Two and a half years later the project is `` over two years behind schedule and at least 50 % over budget , the loss for the provider being estimated at â 1.5 billion '' .
After the oil crisis of the early 1970s , the French government decided in 1974 to move towards self-sufficiency in electricity production , primarily through the construction of nuclear power stations . France today produces around 78.1 % of its electricity through nuclear power . Because France produces an overall electricity surplus , it exports nuclear-produced energy . Some of this goes to countries which are ostensibly against the use of nuclear energy , such as Germany . The Board of ElectricitÃ de France -LRB- Ã lectricitÃ de France or EDF -RRB- has approved construction of a 1630 MWe European Pressurized Reactor or EPR at Flamanville , Normandy . Construction is expected to begin in late 2007 , with completion in 2012 .
In the 1970s , an anti-nuclear movement in France , consisting of citizens ' groups and political action committees , emerged . There were many large anti-nuclear protests and demonstrations . More recently , targeted campaigns have been conducted , mainly by Greenpeace , and Sortir du nuclÃ aire -LRB- France -RRB- has called for an official safety inspection of the Areva facilities .
In 2000 , the German government , consisting of a coalition including the Green party Alliance ' 90\/The Greens officially announced its intention to phase out nuclear power in Germany . JÃ 1\/4 rgen Trittin , the Minister of Environment , Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety , reached an agreement with energy companies on the gradual shut down of the country 's nineteen nuclear power plants and a cessation of civil usage of nuclear power by 2020 . Legislation was enacted in the Nuclear Exit Law . The power plants in Stade and Obrigheim were turned off on November 14 , 2003 , and May 11 , 2005 , respectively . Dismantling of the plants is scheduled to begin in 2007 . But the Nuclear Exit Law did not ban enrichment stations - one in Gronau has received permission to extend operations . There have been concerns over the safety of the phase-out , particularly in terms of the transport of nuclear waste . In 2005 Angela Merkel won the German federal election in 2005 with the CDU party . She has subsequently announced to re-negotiate with energy companies the time limit for a shut down of nuclear power stations . But as part of her pact with the SPD , with whom the CDU form a coalition , the phase-out policy has for now been retained .
In November 2008 , a shipment of radioactive waste from German nuclear plants arrived at a storage site near Gorleben after being delayed by large protests from nuclear activists . More than 15,000 people took part in the protests which involved blocking trucks with sit-down demonstrations and blocking the route with tractors . The demonstrations were partly a response to conservative calls for a rethink of the planned phaseout of nuclear power stations .

Nuclear energy accounts for about 30 % of Japan 's total electricity production , from 47.5 GWe of capacity -LRB- net -RRB- . There are plans to increase this to 37 % in 2009 and 41 % in 2014 .
On 16 July 2007 a severe earthquake hit the region where Tokyo Electric 's Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant is located . The plant with seven units is the largest single nuclear power station in the world . All of the reactors were shut down and are expected to remain closed for damage verification and repairs for at least one year .
During the Fukushima nuclear disaster there was a failure of cooling systems at Fukushima I Nuclear Power Station in Japan on March 11 , 2011 , and a nuclear emergency was declared . This was the first time a nuclear emergency had been declared in Japan , and 140,000 residents within 20km of the plant were moved out . Explosions and a fire resulted in dangerous levels of radiation , resulting in a stock market collapse and panic-buying in supermarkets .
Shippingport power plant was the first commercial nuclear power plant built in the United States in 1958 . After the growth of nuclear power in the 1960s , the Atomic Energy Commission anticipated that more than 1,000 reactors would be operating in the United States by 2000 . But by the end of the 1970s , it became clear that nuclear power would not grow nearly so dramatically , and more than 120 reactor orders were ultimately canceled .
Anthrax was spread through the mail . The anthrax spores were put in envelopes and sent to several news media offices and two U.S. senates . 22 were infected and five died . It was believed that the person who was responsible for this was Dr. Bruce Ivins , a senior biodefense researcher , who was actually employed by the U.S. government .

Robert Lee Frost -LRB- March 26 , 1874 -- January 29 , 1963 -RRB- was an American poet . He is most well-known for his realistic writings of rural life and his command of American informal -LRB- slang -RRB- speech . His work frequently employed settings from rural life in New England in the early twentieth century , using them to examine complex social and philosophical themes . A popular and often-quoted poet , Frost was honored often during his lifetime , receiving four Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry .
Robert Frost was born in San Francisco , California , to journalist William Prescott Frost , Jr. , and Isabelle Moodie .
Frost 's father was a teacher and later an editor of the San Francisco Evening Bulletin -LRB- later the San Francisco Examiner -RRB- , and an unsuccessful candidate for city tax collector . After his death on May 5 , 1885 the family moved across the country to Lawrence , Massachusetts . Frost graduated from Lawrence High School in 1892 . Frost 's mother joined the Swedenborgian church and had him baptized in it , but he left the church as an adult .
Although known for his later understanding of rural life , Frost grew up in the city , and published his first poem in his high school 's magazine . He attended Dartmouth College for two months , long enough to be accepted into the Theta Delta Chi fraternity . Frost returned home to teach and to work at various jobs .
In 1894 he sold his first poem , `` My Butterfly : An Elegy '' -LRB- published in the November 8 , 1894 , edition of the New York Independent -RRB- for fifteen dollars . Proud of this accomplishment , he proposed marriage to Elinor Miriam White , but she waited , wanting to finish college before they married . Frost then went on a trip to the Great Dismal Swamp in Virginia , and asked Elinor again upon his return . Having graduated , she agreed and they were married .
He attended liberal arts studies at Harvard for two years , but left to support his growing family . Shortly before dying , Robert 's grandfather purchased a farm for Robert and Elinor in Derry , New Hampshire ; and Robert worked the farm for nine years , while writing early in the mornings and producing many of the poems that would later become famous . His farming was unsuccessful and he returned to education as an English teacher at New Hampshire 's Pinkerton Academy from 1906 to 1911 , then at the New Hampshire Normal School -LRB- now Plymouth State University -RRB- in Plymouth , New Hampshire .
In 1912 Frost sailed with his family to Great Britain , living first in Glasgow before settling in Beaconsfield outside London . His first book of poetry , A Boy 's Will , was published the next year . In England he made some important friends , including Edward Thomas -LRB- a member of the group known as the Dymock Poets -RRB- , T.E. Hulme , and Ezra Pound . Surrounded by his peers , Frost wrote some of his best work while in England .
As World War I began , Frost returned to America in 1915 and bought a farm in New Hampshire , where he started a career of writing , teaching , and lecturing . This family homestead served as the Frosts ' summer home until 1938 , and is used today as The Frost Place , a museum and poetry conference site . During the years 1916 â `` 20 , 1923 â `` 24 , and 1927 â `` 1938 , Frost taught English at Amherst College in Massachusetts , notably encouraging his students to account for the sounds of the human voice in their writing .
For forty-two years â `` from 1921 to 1963 - Frost spent almost every summer and fall teaching at the Bread Loaf School of English of Middlebury College , at its mountain campus at Ripton , Vermont . The college now owns and maintains his former Ripton farmstead as a national historic site near the Bread Loaf campus . In 1921 Frost accepted a fellowship teaching post at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , where he resided until 1927 ; while there he was awarded a lifetime appointment at the University as a Fellow in Letters . The Robert Frost Ann Arbor home is now situated at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn , Michigan . Frost returned to Amherst in 1927 . In 1940 he bought a 5 a plot in South Miami , Florida , naming it Pencil Pines ; he spent his winters there for the rest of his life .
Harvard 's 1965 alumni directory indicates Frost received an honorary degree there . Although he never graduated from college , Frost received over 40 honorary degrees , including ones from Princeton , Oxford and Cambridge universities ; and was the only person to receive two honorary degrees from Dartmouth College . During his lifetime , the Robert Frost Middle School in Fairfax , Virginia , and the main library of Amherst College were named after him .
Frost was 86 when he spoke and performed a reading of his poetry at the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy on January 20 , 1961 . He died in Boston two years later , on January 29 , 1963 , of complications from prostate surgery . He was buried at the Old Bennington Cemetery in Bennington , Vermont . His epitaph quotes a line from one of his poems : `` I had a lover 's quarrel with the world . ''
Frost 's poems are analyzed in the Anthology of Modern American Poetry -LRB- Oxford University Press -RRB- where it is mentioned that behind a sometimes charmingly familiar and rural front , Frost 's poetry frequently presents hopeless and hostile undertones which often are either unseen or unanalyzed .
One of the original collections of Frost materials is found in the Special Collections department of the Jones Library in Amherst , Massachusetts . The collection consists of approximately twelve thousand items , including original manuscript poems and letters , correspondence , and photographs , as well as audio and visual recordings .
The Norwegian Nobel Committee is the group which gives the Nobel Peace Prize every year . It has five members who are elected by the Norwegian Parliament and has the same political makeup as the parliament .
Alfred Nobel died in December 1896 , and in his will he left a lot of money to start a number of prizes to given each year , to be called the Nobel Prize . The money would be looked after by the Nobel Foundation , and the prizes would be given out by a number of different groups . The other Nobel Prizes would be given by existing Swedish groups , the Swedish Academy , the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences , and the Karolinska Institutet . The job of giving the Nobel Peace Prize was given to the Norwegian Parliament . A group of five people , to be called the Norwegian Nobel Committee , would decide who should win the prize . . The Peace Prize would be given to the person who had done the most work to get countries to work together , to make the world 's armies smaller , or to hold peace talks when needed . Legal expert Fredrik Heffermehl has said that a parliament could not be expected to handle a legal jobs like looking after a will . Parliaments make and change laws , but a will can not be changed unless it has clearly become out of date . At the time this problem was not talked about very much , as the Norwegian Parliament felt that they needed to act quickly in case the money was lost in a legal battles . They agreed to give the Peace Prize on 26 April 1897 and on August 5 , 1897 they worked out the rules for who could be elected to the Norwegian Nobel Committee .
The first Peace Prize was given in 1901 to Henri Dunant and FrÃ dÃ ric Passy . At first , the committee was filled with active members of the parliament and every year its reports were talked about in parliamentary sessions . These links to the Norwegian Parliament were later weakened so that the committee became more independent . The name was changed from the Norwegian Nobel Committee to the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament in 1901 , but changed back in 1977 . Now , members of parliament can not be on the committee , unless they have said that they will be leaving the parliament soon . The committee is currently made up of five people who have all left the parliament .
But the committee is still mainly made up of politicians . A 1903 idea to elect a law expert -LRB- Ebbe Hertzberg -RRB- was rejected . In 1948 , the election system was changed to make the committee have the same political makeup as the parliament . The Norwegian Labor Party , which had a majority of seats in the Norwegian Parliament made this change . Many people do not like this change , but it is still the way the committee is elected . There have been suggestions about having non-Norwegian members in the committee , but this has never happened .
The Norwegian Nobel Committee is helped by the Norwegian Nobel Institute , started in 1904 . The committee might get more than a hundred different names for people to be given the prize . It asks the Nobel Institute in February every year to study about twenty possible winners . The director of the Nobel Institute is also the secretary to the Norwegian Nobel Committee . Currently this position is held by to Geir Lundestad . ThorbjÃ rn Jagland has been the Norwegian Nobel Committee 's leader since 2009 .

Code Lyoko is a French animated television series .
Code Lyoko is about five teenagers who are juggling with their normal school life and a virtual world called Lyoko .
Aelita , Ulrich , Yumi and Odd go into the world called Lyoko . Jeremie does not go into Lyoko . Instead , he is the one who lets them go into lyoko . When the 4 of them are ready to go to lyoko he virtualizes them . Then he tells Aelita , Yumi , Ulrich and Odd where the tower is . When Aelita deactivates the tower Jeremie presses a botton on the supercalculator 's keyboard and says `` retern to the past now '' Also , XANA stole the keys to lyoko from Aelita 's memory . Then XANA made replikas of Lyoko and , using the Skidblanir , the lyoko warriors destroy the replicas one by one .
Jeremy Belpois : Jeremie is a very clever boy . He is the best of his class , and even of the school , in all the subjects , except sports . He is also a computer genius . He restarted the supercomputer that contained Lyoko -LRB- see 3x : XANA Awakens -RRB- . In the factory , he is the supervisor : he virtualizes the Lyoko warriors and the vehicles , he lets them know the Life Points they still have and where the towers and the monsters are . He has never been seen on Lyoko , but he attempted it a few times . First time , the transfer failed and he was stuck in the Virtual Limbo . The second time , he went to a world parallel to Lyoko , the was made by XANA . The third time , It was successful , but we did not see him , but according to Odd and Ulrich , he looked `` ridiculous '' .
Odd Della Robbia : Odd 's vehicle in Lyoko is the overboard to ride around in Lyoko . Odd 's attack is laser arrows that come out of his hand and he screams `` laser arrow ! '' Odd is not very good when it comes to school but he always makes you laugh . Odd wears purple and little bit of yellow .
Ulrich Stern : Ulrich is one of the Lyoko warriors . On Lyoko , he is a samurai , and has a katana , and his vehicle is the overbike . He can use `` Triplicate '' in order to create two clones of himself , and `` Supersprint '' to run quickly . When he uses both at the same time , it 's called `` Triangulate '' . On Earth , he is very mysterious , and does not often speak about himself . He has a crush for Yumi , but they never admit it .
Yumi Ishiyama : Yumi is a Japanese girl . Her vehicle in Lyoko is the overwing . She is a day student at Kadic . She has a crush on Ulrich . She often wears black clothes . She has a brother : Hiroki . In lyoko she wears her traditional Japanese warrior outfit proudly as she defeats XANA 's monsters with her metallic fan .
Aelita Schaeffer or Aelita Stones Aelita is someone who does not really fight . She deactivates the tower that XANA activated and she is the only one who can deactivate towers .

Lepidodendron is an extinct genus of primitive -LRB- tree-like -RRB- plant . They were the first large land plants , and a major part of the coal forest tropical flora .
They were huge , over 30 m , and the trunks were often over 1 m in diameter .
Sometimes called ` giant club mosses ' , they are actually closer to quillworts than to clubmosses .
They thrived during the Pennsylvanian sub-period of the Carboniferous 315 â `` 300 million years years ago .
The conditions were tropical swamps and rain forests of a huge river system much larger that the Amazon basin .
The river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched across Pangaea 5000km from eastern Canada to the Ukraine , and was 700km wide . p6 This would make the Pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on Earth today .
The rainforest system collapsed about halfway throught the Pennsylvanian , and was replaced by a cooler , drier climate .
The wetland forests ended when the land level was raised by the pressure of the Gondwana continent against Laurussia , causing the zone of contact to be raised . The end of the Coal Measures marks the end of the Carboniferous period . China was too far away to be affected , and there the wetland forests continued for another 50 million years , into the early Permian . p30
Lepidodendron had tall , thick trunks that rarely branched and were topped with a crown of bifurcating branches bearing clusters of leaves . These leaves were long and narrow , similar to large blades of grass , and were spirally-arranged .
The closely packed diamond-shaped leaf scars left on the trunk and stems as the plant grew provide some of the most interesting and common fossils in Carboniferous shales and accompanying coal deposits . These fossils look much like tire tracks or alligator skin .
Peter -LRB- `` Pete '' -RRB- Shotton was a longtime friend of John Lennon , who founded The Beatles . He later wrote a memoir , John Lennon `` In My Life '' , that was later retitled The Beatles , Lennon and Me .
Shotton and Lennon met as boys , in their hometown of Woolton , England . Woolton is a suburb of Liverpool . The two fought at first , but soon became best friends . They went to school together , and often got into trouble together . They formed a `` gang '' , with other boys who lived nearby .
During their teenage years , rock and roll became popular in England , as it did in America . Folk music and skiffle were also popular . Young people all over England formed skiffle bands , and played folk and rock songs . Lennon got a guitar from his mother . He and Shotton formed a band , the Quarry Men , with classmates from their school -LRB- named Quarry Bank -RRB- , and other friends .
Shotton 's role in the band was to play percussion on a washboard , and to sing harmony . While Lennon had genuine musical talent , Shotton did not become a skilled musician , and did not enjoy playing music . After Paul McCartney joined the Quarry Men , he and Lennon began to work together on music . McCartney was very talented , and Shotton felt out of place in the band . He waited a long time , before he finally told Lennon .
Lennon `` fired '' Shotton from the Quarry Men after they played at a party . He took the washboard away and broke it over Shotton 's head . All the same , they were still friends , and spent time together . When they finished high school , Lennon went on to art college , and Shotton trained to become a police officer . The Quarry Men changed from playing skiffle to playing rock and roll . They also changed names a few times , before calling themselves the Beatles .
When Lennon became famous with the Beatles , he invited Shotton to visit at different times . He and George Harrison , another band member , bought a supermarket with part of their royalties , and made Shotton its manager . Shotton married and had a son . He spent most of the week with his family , but would visit Lennon 's home on weekends . Lennon counted on Shotton to be a real friend , who was not only around because Lennon was famous or rich . Shotton and Lennon 's wife Cynthia got along well , and Shotton sometimes took Cynthia out for the evening , when Lennon needed to work on music .
Shotton also helped now and then with the Beatles 's music . He sometimes helped brainstorm or critique ideas for songs , or played tambourine or other percussion instruments on their recordings . Later , when the Beatles started their own company , Apple Corps , Shotton became its first managing director .
Apple Corps was not a successful company , and it caused problems between the Beatles , and with the people who worked with them . The problems were not Shotton 's fault , but he felt as much pressure and stress as anyone . He resigned his job at Apple . Lennon tried Shotton out as a personal assistant , but this did not go well . Lennon 's relationship with Yoko Ono also caused problems between Lennon and Shotton .
Adrastea or ' , is the second closest moon to Jupiter . It was found by David C. Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson in Voyager 2 probe photographs taken in 1979 and received the designation ' . In 1983 , it was named after the mythological Adrastea , who was a daughter of Jupiter and Ananke .
Adrastea was the first moon to be found from images taken by an interplanetary spacecraft , rather than through telescopic photography .
Adrastea is non-spherical and measures 20x16x14 kmÂ across . What Adrastea is made of and the mass of Adrastea are not known , but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea -LRB- ~ 0.86 g\/cm Â -RRB- its mass can be estimated at ~ 2 Ã -- 1015 kg . Amalthea 's density implies that moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10-15 % , and Adrastea may be similar .
No surface details of Adrastea are known , due to the low resolution of available images .
Adrastea is the smallest and second closest member of the closer moons to Jupiter . It orbits Jupiter at ~ 129,000 km -LRB- 1.806 Jupiter radii -RRB- within the planet 's Main Ring . The orbit has very small eccentricity ~ 0.0015 and inclination ~ 0.03 Â relative to the equator of Jupiter .
Adrastea was found in Voyager 1 and 2 images , but appeared only as a dot . The Galileo spacecraft was able to see its shape , but the images remain poor .

A hydrocarbon is a type of chemical compound . It is made of only hydrogen and carbon atoms . They can be found in crude oil and are separated by fractional distillation -LRB- which means they are separated into different groups -RRB- . The hydrogen and carbon are bonded with non-polar covalent bonds . Because of it 's lack of polar covalent bonds , hydrocarbons can not create hydrogen bonds with water and are hydrophobic .
Hydrocarbons are grouped into `` families '' or `` homologous series '' . There are five main families . The hydrocarbons in each family have a general formula and similar physical and chemical properties .
Alkanes are the simplest hydrocarbons . Their general formula is CnH2n +2 .
Alkenes are similar to alkanes . The main difference between them is that alkenes have a carbon to carbon double bond . The general formula for the alkenes is CnH2n .
Note that there is not `` Methene '' . Methene is not possible as alkenes require a carbon-carbon double bond and methane only has one carbon atom .
Alkynes have a carbon to carbon triple bond . CnH2n-2 is their general formula .
`` Methyne '' does not exist because of methane 's one carbon atom .
Cycloalkanes are isomers of alkenes . They have the same general formula -LRB- CnH2n -RRB- , the only difference is that they do not have a carbon to carbon double bond .
Note that the alkane Methane and the alkene Ethene do not have a cycloalkane because they can only form a straight line .
Alkadienes have two carbon to carbon double bonds . Their general formula is CnH2n-2 . They are isomers of Alkynes .
Aromatic hydrocarbons are aromatic organic molecules that form flat ring-shaped bonds . The most simplest of aromatic hydrocarbons are benzene and indole . They can have one ring , heterocyclic , like benzene or 2 rings , bicyclic like napthalene -LRB- primary ingredient in mothballs -RRB- or many rings , polycyclic like anthracene -LRB- red dye colourant -RRB- .

The Madrid Symphony Orchestra is an orchestra based in Madrid , the capital of Spain . It was started in 1903 .
The orchestra gave its first public concert under the conductor , Alonso CordelÃ s on 7 February 1904 at the Teatro Real . The next year Enrique FernÃ ndez ArbÃ s became conductor of the orchestra , and he stayed with them for more than 30 years . The orchestra played a lot of Spanish music as well as music by composers from other European countries . Some very famous people such as Igor Stravinsky and Richard Strauss conducted the orchestra . The orchestra gave the first performances of famous pieces such as : Falla 's Nights in the Gardens of Spain -LRB- 1916 -RRB- and Prokofiev 's Second Violin Concerto -LRB- 1935 -RRB- .
During the Spanish Civil War it was difficult to keep the concerts going . After the war , in June 1939 , ArbÃ s died and many of the musicians had gone into exile because of the rise of the dictator General Francisco Franco . The conductor Enrique JordÃ kept the orchestra going until 1945 when the World War II ended .
From 1958 the orchestra often played for comic Spanish operas called zarzuelas . They often traveled through Spain and to Portugal and Latin America giving concerts . .
In 1965 a new orchestra , the Orquesta SinfÃ nica de RTVE , was started . This made things difficult for the Madrid Symphony Orchestra . They had to spend a lot of time playing for the Teatro de la Zarzuela . In the 1970s they made a lot of recordings of zarzuelas and Spanish operas . The recordings were very good , but they did not have much time for orchestral concerts .
After Francoâ s death the orchestra became the official orchestra for the Teatro de la Zarzuela . Later , when a new concert hall , the Auditorio Nacional de MÃ sica was opened , the orchestra had more opportunity to give orchestra concerts . In 1997 , the Orchestra moved out of the Teatro de la Zarzuela and moved to the Teatro Real where they will stay at least until 2009 . The orchestra now have an educational plan to help young children listen to music and encourage them to play instruments .
Today the orchestra is conducted by JesÃ s LÃ pez Cobos .

31 Euphrosyne is one of the biggest main belt asteroids , found by James Ferguson on September 1 , 1854 . It was the first asteroid found from North America . It is named after Euphrosyne , one of the Charites in Greek mythology .
It is the eighth biggest main belt asteroid and contains around 1 % of the mass of the entire asteroid belt , but is a very dark body near the belt 's farther edge . Consequently Euphrosyne is never visible with binoculars , having a maximum magnitude at the best possible opposition of around +10.2 , which is actually fainter than any of the thirty asteroids previously found .
It has not been studied a lot despite being one of the biggest asteroids . It is a normal C-type asteroid with a primitive surface . Its orbit , however , is quite unusual . It 's orbit is similar to that of 2 Pallas in its high inclination and eccentricity . Whereas Pallas and Eris - the only bigger bodies with comparably tilted orbits - have nodes near perihelion and aphelion , Euphrosyne 's perihelion lies at the northernmost point of its orbit . During a rare perihelic opposition Euphrosyne is very high in the sky from northern latitudes , but invisble from such countries as New Zealand and Chile .
Its apparently low density suggests that , unlike 10 Hygiea , 704 Interamnia and 52 Europa , Euphrosyne is a loosely-packed rubble pile -LRB- an asteroid that has been broken apart by a collision with all the pieces pulled together by gravity -RRB- . Its rotation period is very common for big asteroids , but nothing is known of its axial tilt .

Gibbons belong to the group of lesser apes . They are known for their ability to swing from one tree to another with great agility and swiftness . White-hand gibbons live in Sumatra , Thailand , and Malaysia .
Gibbons are known to be the best tree travelers in the animal kingdom . They almost seem to be flying as they swing themselves hand over hand through the trees . Like great apes , gibbons can also walk upright on the ground . When they walk on the ground , gibbons hold their long arms in the air to keep them from dragging .
Gibbons are `` singers '' too . Their powerful voices travel for kilometers through the forests of Southeast Asia . At times , a male , a female , and their young get together and `` sing '' in a chorus . These sounds help groups of gibbons stay in contact . They also tell unwelcome visitors to stay away .
Gibbons stay busy for most of the day . They swing through the trees , looking for leaves , flowers , fruit , and insects to eat . When night falls , small groups settle down in familiar trees for a good night 's rest .
Unlike most other primates , male and female gibbons are not very different in size and shape , although they may differ in color . The meales are usually black , while the females tend to be ash blond . Female gibbons have one offspring per gestation period and live about 25 years .

The Carnac stones are the largest collection of megalithic standing stones in the world . The more than 3,000 prehistoric standing stones were cut from local rock and erected by the pre-Celtic people of Brittany .
The stones were erected at some stage during the Neolithic period , probably around 3300 BC , but some may be as old as 4500 BC . The stones occur in a number of Neolithic sites around the French village of Carnac , in Brittany . They include rows of stones -LRB- alignments -RRB- , dolmens , tumuli and single menhirs .
In recent centuries , many of the sites have been neglected , with reports of dolmens being used as sheep shelters , chicken sheds or even ovens . Stones have been removed to make way for roads , or used as building materials . The management of the sites is a controversial topic .
There are three major groups of stone rows â '' MÃ nec , Kermario and Kerlescan â '' which may have once formed a single group , but have been split up as stones were removed for other purposes .
Eleven converging rows of menhirs stretching for 1165 b. There is what may be the remains of stone circles at either end . According to the tourist office there is a `` cromlech containing 71 stone blocks '' at the western end and a very ruined cromlech at the eastern end . The largest stones , around 4 m high , are at the wider , western end ; the stones then become as small as 0.6 m high along the length of the alignment before growing in height again toward the extreme eastern end .
This fan-like layout recurs a little further along to the east in the Kermario alignment . It consists of 1029 stones in ten columns , about 1300 m in length . A stone circle to the east end , where the stones are shorter , was revealed by aerial photography .
A smaller group of 555 stones , further to the east of the other two sites . It is composed of 13 lines with a total length of about 800 m , ranging in height from 80 c to 4 m. At the extreme west , where the stones are tallest , there is a stone circle which has 39 stones . There may also be another stone circle to the north .
A much smaller group , further east again of Kerlescan , falling within the commune of La TrinitÃ - sur-Mer . These are now set in woods , and most are covered with moss and ivy .
There are several tumuli , mounds of earth built up over a grave . In this area , they generally feature a passage leading to a central chamber which once held neolithic artefacts .
The tumulus of Saint-Michel was constructed between 5000 BC and 3400 BC . At its base it is 125 b , and is 12 m high . It required 35000 m of stone and earth . Its function was the same as that of the pyramids of Egypt : a tomb for the members of the ruling class . It contained various funerary objects , such as 15 stone chests , pottery , jewellery , most of which are currently held by the Museum of Prehistory of Carnac . It was excavated in 1862 by RenÃ Galles with a series of vertical pits , digging down 8 m. Le Rouzic also excavated it between 1900 and 1907 discovering the tomb and the stone chests .
A chapel was built on top in 1663 but was rebuilt in 1813 , before being destroyed in 1923 . The current building is an identical reconstruction of the 1663 chapel , built in 1926 .
Also known as Er ManÃ , it is a chamber tomb 85 m long , 35 m wide , and 5 m high . It has a dolmen at the west end , and two tombs at the east end . A small menhir , approximately 3 m high , is nearby .
There are several dolmens scattered around the area . These dolmens are generally considered to have been tombs , however the acidic soil of Brittany has eroded away the bones . They were constructed with several large stones supporting a `` capstone '' , then buried under a mound of earth . In many cases , the mound is no longer present , sometimes due to archeological excavation , and only the large stones remain , in various states of ruin .
There are some individual menhirs and at least one other formation which do not fit into the above categories .
An arrangement of stones to form the perimeter of a large rectangle . Originally a `` tertre tumulus '' with a central mound , it is 37 m long , and aligned to east of northeast . The quadrilateral is 10 m wide to the east , but only 7 m wide at the west .
Near the quadrilateral is a single massive menhir , now known as the `` Giant '' . Over 6.5 m tall , it was re-erected around 1900 by Zacharie Le Rouzic , and overlooks the nearby Kerlescan alignment .

Bing is a cultivar -LRB- farmed type -RRB- of the wild or sweet cherry -LRB- Prunus avium -RRB- that started in the Pacific Northwest , in Milwaukie , Oregon , United States . The Bing remains a major cultivar in Oregon , Washington , and British Columbia . It is the most produced variety of sweet cherry in the United States .
The cultivar was created as a crossbred graft from the Republican cherry in 1875 by Oregon horticulturist Seth Lewelling and his Manchurian Chinese foreman Ah Bing , for whom the cultivar is named .
Ah Bing was reportedly born in China and immigrated to the U.S. in about 1855 . He worked as a foreman in the Lewelling family fruit orchards in Milwaukie for about 35 years , supervising other workers and caring for trees . He went back to China in 1889 for a visit . Due to the restrictions of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 he never returned to the United States . Some say Ah Bing developed the cultivar , others that it was developed by Lewelling and named in Bing 's honor due to his long service as orchard foreman .
Bing cherries are used almost exclusively for fresh market . Bings are large , dark and firm cherries that ship well , but will crack open if exposed to rain near harvest . A wet climate is required for the harvest of the bing cherry .
Bing cherries are high in anti-oxidants . A study by the United States Department of Agriculture has shown that fresh Bing cherries may help sufferers of arthritis and gout . However , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warns that these are yet unproven claims .

Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta -LRB- born March 28 , 1986 -RRB- , best known by her stage name Lady Gaga , is an American singer-songwriter and musician . She got her stage name from the song `` Radio Ga Ga '' by the band Queen . In 2008 , she made an album called , The Fame , and she tells us `` about how everyone can feel famous . '' Lady Gaga has a contralto vocal range .
Lady Gaga was born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta in New York City on March 28 , 1986 , the oldest child of Joseph Germanotta , internet businessman , and Cynthia . She learned to play piano at the age of four , wrote her first piano song at 13 and began performing live by age 14 . At the age of 11 , Gaga started going to Convent of the Sacred Heart , a private Roman Catholic school on Manhattan 's Upper East Side , but has often said her family was n't rich , saying that her parents `` both came from lower-class families , so we 've worked for everything â `` my mother worked eight to eight out of the house , in telecommunications , and so did my father . '' An actor in high school , Gaga played lead roles as Adelaide in Guys and Dolls and Philia in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum . Gaga said her high school life was `` very dedicated , very studious , very disciplined '' but also `` insecure '' as she told in an interview , `` I didnâ t fit in , and I felt like a freak . ''
At age 17 , Gaga was admitted early into the New York University 's Tisch School of the Arts and lived in a NYU dorm on 11th Street . There she studied music and helped her songwriting writing essays on art , religion , social issues and politics . Gaga felt that she was more creative than some of her classmates . `` Once you learn how to think about art , you can teach yourself , '' she said . By the second semester of her sophomore year , she left school to focus on her musical career . Her father agreed to pay her rent for a year , if she agreed to go back to Tisch if she failed . `` I left my entire family , got the cheapest apartment I could find , and ate shit until somebody would listen , '' she said .

I 've been working on -LRB- the album -RRB- for months , and I feel very strongly that it 's finished right now . Some artists take years . I do n't . I write music every day . '' Gaga has said the album is about `` what keeps us up at night and what makes us afraid . ''
Gaga also worked with Elton John to make a new duet for the soundtrack to the upcoming Disney movie Gnomeo and Juliet . The song , called `` Hello , Hello '' , will be released in February 2011 . She released her single Born This Way on 11 February 2011 .

She has several tattoos ; words tattooed on her left arm is `` the arm that holds -LRB- her -RRB- mic -LRB- rophone -RRB- . ''
Gaga says much of her early success is thanks to her gay fans and is often called a `` rising gay icon . '' Early in her career she had trouble being played on the radio , and stated , `` The turning point for me was the gay community . I 've got so many gay fans and they 're so loyal to me and they really lifted me up . They 'll always stand by me and I 'll always stand by them . It 's not an easy thing to create a fanbase . '' In the inside of her album The Fame , she said , `` I love you so much . You were the first heartbeat in this project , and your support and brilliance means the world to me . I will always fight for the gay community hand in hand with this incredible team . '' One of her first performances on television was in May 2008 at the NewNowNext Awards , an awards show on the LGBT television network Logo , where she sang her song `` Just Dance '' . In June , she sang the song again at the San Francisco Pride event . After The Fame came out , she said the hit song `` Poker Face '' was about being bisexual . When she was a guest on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in May 2009 , she complimented DeGeneres for being `` an inspiration for women and for the gay community '' . She later said that the October 11 , 2009 , National Equality March rally on the national mall was `` the single most important event of her career . '' As she left , she said `` Bless God and bless the gays , '' similar to her 2009 MTV Video Music Awards speech a month earlier . At the rally , she sang a cover of John Lennon 's `` Imagine '' saying `` I 'm not going to -LRB- play -RRB- one of my songs tonight because tonight is not about me , it 's about you . '' She changed the lyrics of the song to talk about the death of Matthew Shepard , a college student murdered because of his homosexuality . In September 2010 , she spoke at a rally in favor of removing the Do n't ask , do n't tell policy , which stopped LGBT people from working openly in the military of the United States . The gay magazine The Advocate said that she had become an important helper for gays and lesbians where President Barack Obama was n't .
Explosives are chemical compounds that cause explosions ; they flare up and burst with a loud sound . Explosive material has many special characteristics : it is a chemically unstable material , it changes its form very fast and , while changing its form , it explodes by bursting and making loud sounds .
There are two types of explosives : low explosives and high explosives . This classification depends on their rate of explosion . Low explosives burn very fast . High explosives explode with bursts . A low explosive is a material , which burns very fast , but does not explode generally . For exploding them , people mix them with high explosives . Sometimes , even a low explosive may explode . A high explosive bursts and explodes very fast . High explosives produce more pressure than low explosives . People use high explosives in mining , destroying old buildings . Military weapons use high explosives .
High explosives may belong to different groups : primary explosives and secondary explosives . Primary explosives rapidly react to shock , friction , and heat . Any shock , friction , or heat makes primary explosives to burn or blast fast . Secondary explosives do not react very fast to shock , friction , and heat . Any shock , friction , or heat may burn such explosives , but not make them to burst and blast . Some people call secondary explosives as base explosives . Some people also tell about another group of explosives . These are tertiary explosives . These explosives do not react to shock , friction , and heat . For explosion , tertiary explosives may need a mixture with secondary explosives .
While sending explosives from one place to another , the packs containing different types of explosives may have different types of markings on the boxes . The United Nations has advised use of such markings . Some examples are :

Blood and soil is an idea that started in the 19th century . It looks at a person 's blood , to see where they come from , and who their ancestors were . It also looks at the soil a person is working on , to make a claim that they should indeed work and occupy that land . In the nineteenth century , the idea was linked to racism and to nationalism . One of the first to use Blut und Boden , or blood and soil was Oswald Spengler in his book Der Untergang des Abendlandes . In the book , Spengler talks about the struggle of blood and soil about the inner form of a relocated species of animal and man . Walther DarrÃ took the phrase and established the link . In his book `` Neuadel aus Blut und Boden '' -LRB- New nobility from blood and soil -RRB- he tries to show the relation between economic and agrarian policies , as well as racial ones .
Another idea of the blood and soil ideology comes from Lamarckism : The ethnic characteristics of a population are linked to the geographical regions it inhabits ; only in this region will it be able to fully live up to its potential .
There is also a literary genre called blood and soil . In it , it shows an agrarian society living up to this ideals . People writing in this style were Gerhard Schumann and Herbert BÃ hme .
The ideas are also sometimes shown in artworks . Artists included Adolf Ziegler , Arthur Kampf , Arno Breker and Josef Thorak . Very often , such artworks were seen as degenerate art when the Nazi party came to power . Artists had to flee , many died in exile .

PÃ re David 's Deer -LRB- Elaphurus davidianus , -RRB- Milu in Chinese -LRB- é é -RRB- , is a species of deer known only in zoos . It likes marshland , and is believed to be native to the subtropics . It eats a mixture of grass and water plants .
Adults weigh between 150 k and 200 k. They have a nine-month gestation period , and one or two fawns are born at a time . They reach maturity at about 14 months , and have been known to reach the age of 23 years .
PÃ re David 's Deer has a long tail , wide hooves , and branched antlers . Adults have summer coats that are bright red with a dark dorsal stripe , and dark gray winter coats . The fawns are spotted .
There is the Chinese official name Milu -LRB- é é -RRB- , a Chinese nickname name -LRB- Traditional Chinese : å ä å , pinyin : sÃ bÃ xiÃ ng -RRB- , and in Japanese : å ä å -LRB- shifuzou -RRB- . Sibuxiang means the `` four unlikes , '' because the deer has been described as having :
With this name , this wild animal became part of Chinese mythology as the mount of Jiang Ziya in the Ming novel Fengshen Yanyi , or `` Investiture of the Gods . ''
This species of deer was first made known to Western science in 1866 , by Father Armand David , a French missionary working in China . He had sent skeletons and a hide to Paris . The Chinese emperor kept a herd of the deer in a royal hunting park in the southern part of Beijing . In 1895 , a flood washed away part of the wall and many of the deer escaped . This left about 20 animals in the park . This last herd of PÃ re David 's Deer in China were eaten by Western and Japanese soldiers during the Boxer Rebellion . The last known deer in the wild was shot in 1939 near the Yellow Sea .
A few animals had been taken illegally to European countries to be put on show . After the remaining population in China had gone , the remaining 18 deer in Europe were taken to Woburn Abbey , England and bred to save the species . The current population comes from this herd , and can be found in zoos around the world . Two herds of PÃ re David 's Deer were reintroduced to Nan Haizi Milu Park , Beijing , and Dafeng Reserve , Jiangsu Province , China in the late 1980s . In spite of the small population size , the animals do not appear to suffer genetic problems .
In October 2008 , the ICUN listed the deer as `` Extinct in the Wild . ''

Pampalon was devoted to Mary ; before going to a Redemptorists ' monastery , he went to a statue of Mary and asked her to pray for the monks to let him join . The Monastery allowed him to join despite his poor health , because they saw his strong desire to become a Redemptorists father . While training to become a Roman Catholic priest his fellow students asked him how he managed to study philosophy so well , and he replied he imagined Mary was asking him the questions . He would make his head touch the floor and pray to her daily , and while dying he would pray to her throughout the day .

Two years ago , Heihachi could not capture Ogre .
Not wanting to give up , Heihachi said to his researchers to get blood samples , skin tissue , and hoof fragments left behind by Ogre -LRB- or known as True Ogre in its true manifestation -RRB- in order to conduct genetic experiments . Heihachiâ s goal was to make a new life form by splicing Ogreâ s genome with his own . However , the research was unsuccessful .
After long experimentation , Heihachiâ s bioengineers came to the conclusion that an extra gene - the `` Devil Gene '' - was needed in order to successfully splice Ogreâ s genetic code into another living organism . Heihachi learned that his own genome did not have the Devil Gene , but he knew someone who had it , Jin Kazama .
Jin , who defeated Ogre in The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 , was shot and wounded by Heihachi . As his life slipped away , Jin transformed into a Devil . Upon his transformation , he struck down Heihachi and took flight . Jinâ s whereabouts were unknown after the Tournament .
Heihachi searched for Jin to no avail . However , Heihachi found a photograph during his search that made him curious . The 20-year-old photograph was an image of a burnt corpse covered with laceration wounds . Heihachi paid much attention to the corpseâ s back , which had what looked like deformed , protruding wing-like limbs .
Thinking that the picture was of Kazuya , his own son whom he threw into a volcano 20 years ago , Heihachi diverted all his resources into a search for the body . This search led Heihachi to G Corporation , a modern biotech firm making unprecedented advances in the field of biogenetics research .
Heihachi found out that the G Corporation found the corpse and got its genetic data . In fact , Heihachi learned that the company was in the middle of creating a new life form by using the data . Heihachi also determined that Kazuyaâ s remains and research data were secured at G Corporationâ s Nebraska and Nepal research laboratories , respectively .
Friday , 25 December . The Tekken Force raided G Corporationâ s maximum security research laboratory in Nepal . The bottom floors of the building were destroyed , and the remaining data storage facility containing file servers was taken away by a group of heavy-duty helicopters .
At the same time , a separate unit led by Heihachi infiltrated the underground research facility in Nebraska , where Kazuyaâ s remains were preserved . As Heihachi looked from his helicopter , he soon realized that unlike the Nepal facility , the operations in Nebraska were not going according to plan . The tactical status monitor screens showed the first wave of the Tekken Force troops being blown out from the storage room where Kazuyaâ s remains were supposedly kept .
Tekken 5 is a fighting video game made by Namco . It was released on the PlayStation 2 , PlayStation Portable and the PlayStation 3 .
After the end of King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 , father Kazuya Mishima and son Jin Kazama , battle each other at Honmaru , somewhere in the Mishima estate . Jin quickly beats his father . The oldest Mishima , Heihachi , enters the Honmaru to find his son defeated and asleep . Heihachi and Jin begin to fight . During the fight , Jin begins to show the Devil he got from his father , Kazuya . Just as it appears that Jin will kill Heihachi , Jin suddenly gains control of his body and flies away .
Suddenly , a bunch of `` Jack '' robots interrupt the battle . Both Kazuya and Heihachi are surprised at the attack , and begin fighting as a team against the Jack robots . During the battle however , Kazuya goes against his father , throws him into the Jack robots and runs away . Raven , watching on top of the cliff , speaks into a headphone and says : `` Heihachi Mishima ... is dead . ''
After hearing of Heihachi 's death , people though that it would bring the end of the Mishima Zaibatsu . However , an unknown person had taken control , and a month later Mishima Zaibatsu announced the opening of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 .
Following the end of the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 , Heihachi Mishima defeated Kazuya Mishima and led him to Honmaru Temple , planning to let both his son Kazuya and his grandson , Jin Kazama , battle and steal their `` Devil Genes '' . Jin defeats both his father and his grandfather and flies away , leaving the latter two asleep . Shortly after , a group Jack-4 robots invade the Honmaru . The robots were made to take Heihachi 's life . At the start , Kazuya and Heihachi fight the Jack-4 's as a team , but eventually Kazuya throws Heihachi across the room as soon as he notices that Heihachi is getting tired . Then , Kazuya turns into Devil Kazuya and escapes , leaving Heihachi to deal with the Jack-4 's by himself . They quickly explode , leaving Heihach . The explosion brings Heihachi 's father Jinpachi Mishima back to life from his 50 year sleep beneath the Temple , and goes to and become head of the Mishima Zaibatsu . A few months later , the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 is announced . It turns out that Heihachi survived the explosion , and now promises to find out and `` break the neck of the one who started this ridiculous tournament ! ''
Tekken 5 kept many features from the older games , as well as new features , such as the new Crush System and the chance to dress up all chaaracters differently -LRB- except for Mokujin -RRB- . It was also the first Tekken game to have a mini-game that hade a story of its own . It also had stages with no walls like the stages in all the older Tekken games -LRB- except for Tekken 4 -RRB- . The stages did not also have all the slopes and uneven ground , like they did in Tekken 4 .
Tekken 5.1 was a small upgrade of the original Tekken 5 that was not released on consoles and instead , was only on arcades . It contained different balance changes to characters of the original game . It also fixed the damage done when using fground moves , instead of ground moves doing 100 % damage , they now only did 70 % damage . The character health bars for this game is a different color to the health bars on the original Tekken 5 .
Tekken : Dark Resurrection -LRB- DR for short -RRB- is an upgraded version of Tekken 5 . It added two new characters , Emily `` Lili '' Rochefort and Sergei Dragunov , and it also added a returning older character , Armor King . Eddy Gordo also got his own character box , rather than just sharing a character box with Christie Monteiro . Plus , the game had new moves for the characters , as well as some changes to some older moves , in order to balance out the characters more , new customization items to use to dres up the characters , new stages , and new before fight and win animations , as well as some camera angle changes to some older ones . The game also recolored the main outfits of most of the characters , and the game 's final boss , Jinpachi Mishima , got a new design , giving him a flame-like appearance , with a horn coming out of his head .
Tekken 5 was re-released on the PlayStation Portable as Tekken : Dark Resurrection -LRB- known as Tekken 5 : Dark Resurrection in arcades and on PlayStation 3 -RRB- with new stages , two new characters , one extra returning character , an online mode , new costumes and more . The character select screen is also diferrent and there are new modes such as the Tekken Dojo mode , where the player has to enter a tournament , defeating ghosts -LRB- not actual ghosts you see at Halloween -RRB- . Later on , after the release of Tekken : Dark Resurrection on the PSP , Namco decided to release the arcade version of Tekken : Dark Resurrection -LRB- called Tekken 5 : Dark Resurrection -RRB- on the PlayStation Store . The PS3 version was a bit diferrent from the PSP version . It was very much like the arcade version , but not exactly . The only things missing are Story mode , Ghost downloads , Tekken Dojo and a Customizing mode -LRB- although you can dress your characters up after you select them and before you fight with them -RRB- . On the PS3 version , Jinpachi is also a playble character , unlike in Tekken 5 and Tekken : Dark Resurrection where he was unpplayable , unless a cheat device such as GameShark or an Action Replay was used -LRB- CWCheat and custom firmware 3.40 for PSP -RRB- .
Lust is a term for a strong desire or wanting , or maybe even needing , often for sexual acts , although it is also commonly used to talk of a lust for life or a lust for power or for other goals .
As a sexual desire , it is considered a vice -LRB- a failing -RRB- by Christianity , which lists it as one of the seven deadly sins .
`` Lust '' was originally an Anglo-Saxon word which meant `` desire '' or `` appetite '' .

Kakadu National Park is in the Northern Territory of Australia , 171 km southeast of Darwin . It is the second largest national park in the world . It covers an area of 1980400 h. It is about 200 kilometres from north to south , and more than 100 kilometres from east to west . It is the size of Slovenia , about one-third the size of Tasmania , or nearly half the size of Switzerland . The Ranger Uranium Mine , one of the biggest Uranium mines in the world , is inside the park .
The name Kakadu comes from Gagadju , the name of an Aboriginal language spoken in the northern part of the Park . Kakadu National Park has many different ecological areas , and many different plant and animal species . The main natural features protected within the National Park include :
Kakadu National Park is famous for the richness of its Aboriginal cultural sites . There are more than 5000 recorded art sites showing Aboriginal culture over thousands of years . The archaeological sites show that Aboriginals have lived here for at least 20 000 and possibly up to 40 000 years .
The cultural and natural values of Kakadu National Park were recognized internationally when the Park was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site . This is an international list of places that are have outstanding cultural or natural values of international significance . Kakadu was listed in three stages : Stage 1 in 1981 , Stage 2 in 1987 , and the entire Park in 1992 .
About half of the land in Kakadu is aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Rights -LRB- Northern Territory -RRB- Act 1976 . Most of the remaining land is currently under claim by Aboriginal people . The areas of the Park that are owned by Aboriginal people are leased by the traditional owners to the Director of National Parks to be managed as a national park . The remaining area is Australian Government land controlled by the Director of National Parks . All of Kakadu is declared a national park under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 .
The Aboriginal traditional owners of the Park are descendants of various clan groups from the Kakadu area . Their lifestyle has changed in recent years , but their traditional customs and beliefs remain very important . About 500 Aboriginal people live in the Park ; many of them are traditional owners . All of Kakadu is jointly managed by Aboriginal traditional owners and the Australian Governmentâ s Department of the Environment and Water Resources through a division known as Parks Australia . Park Management is directed by the Kakadu Board of Management .
Kakadu was set up at a time when Australians were becoming more interested in national parks for conservation and in recognizing the land rights of Aboriginal people . A national park in the Alligator River region was proposed as early as 1965 . In 1978 the Australian Government took over the titles of various pieces of land that now makes up Kakadu National Park .
Kakadu National Park was made a park in three stages between 1979 and 1991 . Each stage of the Park includes Aboriginal land under the Land Rights Act that is leased to the Director of National Parks or land that is subject to a claim to traditional ownership under the Land Rights Act . Most of the land that was to become part of Stage One of Kakadu was given to the Kakadu Aboriginal Land Trust under the Land Rights Act in August 1978 . In November 1978 , the Land Trust and the Director signed a lease for the land to be managed as a national park . Stage One of the Park was declared on 5 April 1979 .
Stage Two was declared on 28 February 1984 . In March 1978 , a claim was lodged under the Land Rights Act for the land included in Stage Two of Kakadu . The land claim was partly successful . In 1986 , three areas in the eastern part of Stage Two were given to the Jabiluka Aboriginal Land Trust . A lease between the Land Trust and the Director of National parks was signed in March 1991 .
In 1987 , a land claim was made for the land in the Goodparla and Gimbat pastoral leases that were to be included in Stage Three of Kakadu . The other area to be included in Stage Three , the Gimbat Resumption and the Waterfall Creek Reserve , were later added to this land claim . The need to create the park in stages was due to the debate over whether mining should be allowed at Guratba -LRB- Coronation Hill -RRB- which is located in the middle of the area referred to as Sickness Country . The traditional ownersâ wishes were ultimately respected and the Australian National Government decided that there would be no mining at Guratba .
In 1996 , the land in Stage Three , apart from the former Goodparla pastoral leases , was given to the Gunlom Aboriginal Land Trust and leased to the Director of National Parks to continue being managed as part of Kakadu .
The Chinese , Malays and Portuguese all claim to have been the first non-Aboriginal explorers of Australiaâ s north coast . The first surviving written account comes from the Dutch . In 1623 Jan Carstenz made his way west across the Gulf of Carpentaria to what is believed to be Groote Eylandt . Abel Tasman was the next explorer to visit in 1644 . He was the first person to record European contact with Aboriginal people . Almost a century later Matthew Flinders surveyed the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1802 and 1803 .
Phillip Parker King , an English navigator entered the Gulf of Carpentaria between 1818 and 1822 . During this time he named the three Alligator Rivers after the large numbers of crocodiles , which he thought were alligators .
Ludwig Leichhardt was the first land-based European explorer to visit the Kakadu region , in 1845 on his way from Moreton Bay in Queensland to Port Essington in the Northern Territory . He followed Jim Jim Creek down from the Arnhem Land escarpment , then went down the South Alligator before crossing to the East Alligator and going north .
In 1862 John McDouall Stuart traveled along the south-western boundary of Kakadu but did not see any people .
The first non-Aboriginal people to visit and have long term contact with Aboriginal people in northern Australia were the Macassans from Sulawesi and other parts of Indonesia . They traveled to northern Australia every wet season , probably from the last quarter of the 17th century , in sailing boats called praus . They came to harvest trepang -LRB- sea cucumber -RRB- , turtle shell , pearls and other prized items to trade in their homeland . Aboriginal people helped in harvesting and processing the trepang , and in collecting and exchanging the other goods .
There is no evidence that the Macassans spent time on the coast of Kakadu . There is evidence of some contact between Macassan culture and Aboriginal people of the Kakadu area . Among the finds from archaeological digs in the Park are glass and metal pieces that probably came from the Macassans , either directly or through trade with the Coburg Peninsula people .
The British attempted a number of settlements on the northern Australian coast in the early part of the 19th century : Fort Dundas on Melville Island in 1824 ; Fort Wellington at Raffles Bay in 1829 ; and Victoria Settlement -LRB- Port Essington -RRB- on the Coburg Peninsula in 1838 . They wanted to secure the north of Australia before the French or Dutch , who had colonised islands further north . The British settlements all failed for a variety of reasons , such as lack of water and fresh food , sickness and isolation . It is difficult to assess the impact of these settlements on the local Aboriginal people and the type of relationship that developed between them and the British . Certainly , some Aboriginals worked at the settlements . Exposure to new sickness was an ever-present danger . As in other parts of Australia , disease and the disruption it caused to society devastated the local Aboriginal population .
Water buffalo have had a big influence on the Kakadu region as well . By the 1880s the number of buffaloes escaped from early settlements had grown so much that hunting them for skins and horns was economically successful .
The industry began on the Adelaide River , close to Darwin , and moved east to the Mary River and Alligator Rivers regions .
Most of the buffalo hunting and skin curing was done in the dry season , between June and September , when buffaloes gathered around the remaining billabongs . During the wet season hunting stopped because the ground was too muddy to follow the buffalo and the harvested hides would rot . The buffalo hunting industry became an important employer of Aboriginal people during the dry-season months .
Missionaries had a big influence on the Aboriginal people of the Alligator Rivers area . Many of the people lived and went to school at missions . Two missions were set up in the region in the early part of the century . Kapalga Native Industrial Mission was started near the South Alligator River in 1899 , but lasted only four years . The Oenpelli Mission began in 1925 , when the Church of England Missionary Society accepted an offer from the Northern Territory Administration to take over the area , which had been used as a dairy farm . The Oenpelli Mission operated for 50 years .
Some writers and anthropologists say that missionaries , in trying to â civilise and institutionaliseâ Aboriginal people , forced them to give up their lifestyle , language , religion , ceremonies and change the whole way they lived . Others say that , although they might not have used the best methods to achieve their goal , the missionaries did care about the Aboriginal people at a time when wider Australian society did not .
The pastoral industry made started slowly in the Top End . Pastoral leases in the Kakadu area were progressively given up from 1889 , because the Victoria River and the Barkly Tablelands were better pastoral regions .
In southern Kakadu much of Goodparla and Gimbat was claimed in the mid-1870s by three pastoralists , Roderick , Travers and Sergison . The leases were later passed on to a series of owners , who were all unsuccessful . In 1987 both stations were taken back by the Commonwealth and added to Kakadu National Park .
There was a sawmill at Nourlangie Camp , begun by Chinese workers , probably before World War I , to cut stands of cypress pine in the area . After World War II there were a number of small-scale activities , including dingo shooting and trapping , brumby shooting , crocodile shooting , tourism and forestry .
Nourlangie Camp was again the site of a sawmill in the 1950s , until the cypress pines were cleared . In 1958 it became a safari camp for tourists . Soon after , a similar camp was started at Patonga and at Muirella Park . People were flown in to hunt buffalo , crocodiles and fishing .
Crocodile hunters often made use of the bush skills of Aboriginal people . By copying a wallabyâ s tail hitting the ground , Aboriginal hunters could attract crocodiles , making it easier to shoot the animals . Using paperbark rafts , they would track the movement of a wounded crocodile and get the carcass for skinning . The skins were then sold to make leather goods . Aboriginal people became less involved in commercial hunting of crocodiles once night spotlight shooting started . Freshwater Crocodiles have been protected by law since 1964 and Saltwater Crocodiles since 1971 .
Minerals were found in the Top End during the building of the Overland Telegraph line between 1870 and 1872 , in the Pine Creek â `` Adelaide River area . A number of short mining booms followed .
The building of the North Australia Railway line helped the mining camps , and places such as Burrundie and Pine Creek became permanent settlements . The mining camps and new settlements drew many Aboriginal people away from Kakadu . No Aboriginal people are known to have worked in the mines but their access to alcohol and other drugs had a huge impact .
Small-scale gold mining began at Imarlkba , near Barramundi Creek , and Mundogie Hill in the 1920s and at Moline -LRB- previously called Eureka and Northern Hercules mine -RRB- , south of the Park , in the 1930s . The mines employed a few local Aboriginal people .
In 1953 uranium was discovered in the the South Alligator River valley . Thirteen small but rich uranium mines operated in the following decade , at their peak in 1957 employing over 150 workers . No Aboriginal people were employed at any of these mines .
Early in the 1970s large uranium deposits were discovered at Ranger , Jabiluka and Koongarra . The Australian Government began an inquiry into land use in the Alligator Rivers region . The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry -LRB- known as the Fox inquiry -RRB- recommended that mining begin at the Ranger site . It also said that Jabiluka and Koongarra sites should be developed , and that a town be built to support the mines . -LRB- Fox et al . 1976 , 1977 -RRB- . The Ranger mine and the service town at Jabiru have had many impacts on Aboriginal people . Aboriginal people have different opinions about mining .
Kakadu is in the tropics , between 12 Â and 14 Â south of the Equator . The climate is monsoonal , with two main seasons : the dry season and the rain season . The ` build up ' describes the change between the dry and the rain . During the dry season -LRB- from April\/May to September -RRB- , there are dry southerly and easterly trade winds . Humidity is relatively low and rain is unusual . At Jabiru , the average maximum temperature for June-July is 32 Â C. During the ` build up ' -LRB- October to December -RRB- conditions can be extremely uncomfortable with high temperatures and high humidity . However , ` build up ' storms are impressive and with many lightning strikes . At Jabiru the average maximum temperature for October is 37.5 Â C.
The rain season -LRB- January to March\/April -RRB- has warm temperatures and rain . Most of the rain is is caused by monsoonal troughs formed over Southeast Asia . Sometimes tropical cyclones cause very heavy rain over small areas . At Jabiru , the average maximum temperature for January is 33 Â C. Annual rainfall in Kakadu National Park ranges from 1,565 mm in Jabiru to 1,300 mm in the Mary River region .
Periods of torrential rain and long dry spells mean that Kakadu can change its appearance according to the season , so is a place deserving of more than one visit .
Kakadu has more than 2000 plant species , because of the different geological areas , landforms and habitats . Kakadu is also said to be one of the most weed free national parks in the world .
The different geographical areas of Kakadu have their own specialised plants . The area called â the Stone Countryâ has â resurrection grassesâ that are able to survive extreme heat , and dry conditions followed by periods of heavy rain . Monsoon forests often develop in the cool moist gorges found in the stone country . The southern hills and basins support several endemic plants that are only found in Kakadu such as Eucalyptus koolpinensis near Jarrangbarnmi -LRB- Koolpin Gorge -RRB- . Lowland areas form a large proportion of Kakadu National Park and are mainly covered in eucalypt-dominated open woodland with the ground layer consisting of a large range of grasses including spear grass , sedges and wildflowers .
The floodplains , which are flooded for several months each year , feature sedges such as spike rush as well patches of freshwater mangroves -LRB- itchy tree -RRB- , pandanus and paper bark trees -LRB- Melaleuca -RRB- . Varieties of water lilies , such as the blue , yellow and white snowflake , are commonly found in these areas . Estuaries and tidal flats are populated with varieties of mangroves , in fact 39 of the 47 Northern Territory species of mangrove are found in Kakadu . These are important for preventing erosion of the coast . Mangroves serve as feeding and breeding grounds for many fish species including the barramundi .
On the tidal flats behind the mangroves , hardy succulents -LRB- samphire -RRB- , grasses and sedges grow . Isolated pockets of monsoon forest grow along the coast and river banks . These forests contain several impressive trees , among them the banyan fig , which can be recognized by its large , spreading aerial roots , and the kapok tree , which has a spiny trunk , large , waxy red flowers and pods full of cotton-like material .
The different areas of Kakadu National Park support a huge number of animals , a number of which have adapted to particular habitats . Some animals in the Park are rare , endangered , vulnerable or endemic . Because of the extreme weather conditions experienced in the Park , many animals are active only at particular times of the day or night or at particular times of the year .
About 62 mammal species have been seen in the Park . Most of them live in the open forest and woodlands and are nocturnal , making it difficult to see them . Others , such as wallabies and kangaroos are active in the cooler parts of the day and are easier to see . The larger mammals are Dingos , Antilopine Kangaroos , Black Wallaroos , Agile Wallabys , and Short-eared Rock Wallabys . Smaller common mammals are northern quolls , brush-tailed phascogales , brown bandicoots , black-footed tree-rats , and black fruit bats . Dugongs are found in the coastal waters . However , recent surveys have shown smaller numbers of nearly all mammals throughout Kakadu . This includes once common and widespread species such as northern quolls .
Kakaduâ s many habitats support more than 280 species of birds . This is about one-third of Australiaâ s bird species . Some birds range over a number of habitats , but many are found in only one environment .
To date , 123 species of reptiles have been found in Kakadu . Being cold blooded , these animals need heat from an external source such as the sun to control their body temperature . This is not to say that reptiles are active only during the day ; in fact , few snakes can withstand Kakaduâ s midday heat and most are active at night .
Two species of crocodile live in Kakadu : the Freshwater Crocodile -LRB- Crocodylus johnstonii -RRB- and the Estuarine , or Saltwater Crocodile -LRB- C. porosus -RRB- . Freshwater Crocodiles have a narrow snout and a single row of four large boney lumps called â scutesâ immediately behind the head . Estuarine Crocodiles do not have these scutes and their snout is broader . The maximum size for a â freshieâ is 3 metres , whereas a â saltieâ can exceed 6 metres .
Kakaduâ s 25 frog species are extremely well adapted to the regionâ s climatic extremes . Many remain dormant during dry times . At the start of the wet season , when the billabongs and swamps start to fill with water , the night air is filled with the sounds of frogs such as the northern bullfrog and the marbled frog . As the water builds up , frogs and tadpoles have plenty of food , such as algae , vegetation , insects , dragonfly nymphs , and other tadpoles . Not all of Kakaduâ s frogs are found in the wetlands : many live in the lowland forests .
Fifty-one species of freshwater fish have been found in Kakaduâ s waterways ; eight of them have a restricted distribution . In the Magela Creek system alone , 32 species have been found . In comparison , the Murrayâ `` Darling river system , the most extensive in Australia , now supports only 27 native fish species . Although introduced fish have been found in most Australian waterways , none have been recorded in the Park .
Kakadu supports more than 10,000 species of insect including grasshoppers , beetles , flies , termites , butterflies and moths , bees , wasps , ants , dragonflies and damselflies , caddis flies , non-biting midges and mayflies . The great variety of insects is a result of the varied habitats and relatively high temperatures throughout the year .
Perhaps the most striking insect-created features in the Park are the termite mounds . The mounds in the southern part of the Park are particularly large and impressive . Leichhardtâ s grasshopper , in colors of orange , blue and black , is perhaps the most spectacular insect found in Kakadu . It is also found on the Arnhem Land plateau and in Gregory National Park .
Kakadu has seen several invasive species threaten the native habitat , particularly in recent decades . Introduced fauna including the Water Buffalo , wild pig and more recently , the Cane Toad have had major effects on habitat . Invasive weeds include Mimosa pigra , which covers 800 kmÂ of the Top End , including vast areas of Kakadu , invasive paragrass displaces the native food of much of Kakadu 's birdlife . Salvinia molesta has infested the Magela floodplain . Brumbies also inhabit areas of the National Park , including Yellow Water .
Each landform has its own range of habitats . Kakaduâ s varied landscapes and the habitats they contain are features that contributed to its listing as a World Heritage Area .
Most of Kakadu was under a shallow sea about 140 million years ago , with the escarpment wall formed from sea cliffs and Arnhem Land from a flat plateau above the sea . Currently the escarpment rises 330 metres above the plateau and stretches 500 kilometres along the East edge of the park and on into Arnhem Land . The escarpment varies from near vertical cliffs in the Jim Jim Falls area to isolated outliers and stepped cliffs in the North .
Chasms and gorges form a network that cut through the rocky platforms on the plateau . The plateau top is a harsh , dry environment where water drains away quickly and top soil is scarce in most areas . Sparse pockets of open forest and woodlands have developed in these areas . However creeks have carved deep gorges in the escarpment in which tall monsoon forests grow . These areas form microclimates for plants and animals and often serve as a refuge during the dry season . Allosyncarpia ternata , a large shady tree found only in the Kakadu and Arnhem Land , is the main plant species .
The outliers are pieces of the Arnhem Land plateau that have become separated from the plateau by erosion . They were islands in the ancient seas that once covered much of Kakadu . The lowland plains stretch over much of the Top End and they make up nearly 70 % of the Park . The soils are shallow and often are above large sheets of laterite -LRB- ironstone -RRB- and a thick profile of strongly leached rocks .
During the wet season , water carried down from the Arnhem Land plateau often overflows from creeks and rivers onto nearby floodplains . Alluvial soils carried in the floodwaters add nutrients to the floodplains . Nutrient-rich soils along with an abundance of water and sunlight make the floodplains an area of prolific plant and animal life . During the dry season the water drains into rivers , creeks and isolated waterholes or billabongs . Kakaduâ s wetlands are listed under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance -LRB- the Ramsar Convention -RRB- for their outstanding ecological , botanical , zoological and hydrological features .
The southern hills and basins cover a large area in the south of the Park , including the headwaters of the South Alligator River . Rocks here have been exposed from beneath the retreating Arnhem escarpment ; they are of volcanic origin and are extremely old -LRB- 2500 million years -RRB- . This landform is characterised by rugged strike ridges separated by alluvial flats .
Kakaduâ s coast and the creeks and river systems under tidal influence -LRB- extending about 100 kilometres inland -RRB- make up this landform . The shape of the estuaries and tidal flats varies considerably from the dry season to the wet season . During the dry season tidal action deposits silt along the river beds and banks . During the wet season the river beds are eroded by the floodwaters and large quantities of fresh and saline water flow out across the tidal flats , where silt is deposited . Large silt loads are also carried out to sea , some of the silt being deposited as a nutrient rich layer on the sea floor , contributing to the muddy waters that characterise Kakaduâ s coastline .
The estuaries and tidal flats are home to many plants and animals adapted to living in the oxygen-deficient saline mud . The dominant habitats are mangrove swamps and samphire flats . Where freshwater springs occur along the coasts and river banks , isolated pockets of coastal monsoon rainforests form .
The art sites of Ubirr , Nourlangie Rock and Nanguluwur are world famous as examples of Aboriginal rock art . These sites are found among the rocks that have given shelter to the Aborigines for thousands of years . The painting in these rock shelters were done for different reasons :
Ubirr is a group of rock outcrops in the northest of the Park , on the edge of the Nadab floodplain . There are several large rock overhangs that would have provided excellent shelter to Aboriginal people over thousands of years . Because it is close to the East Alligator River and Nadab floodplains , it means that there would have been plenty of food . This is shown in much of the rock art here . Animals shown in the main gallery include barramundi , catfish , mullet , goanna , snake-necked turtle , pig-nosed turtle , Rock-haunting Ringtail Possum , and wallaby and thylacine -LRB- Tasmanian Tiger -RRB- .
There are also images of the Rainbow Serpent said to have created much of the landscape as well as mischievous Mimi spirits and the story of the Namarrgarn Sisters . Many stories connected to Aboriginal rock are highly complex and linked to other stories . Often the true meanings have been lost , but they all have a purpose which is usually to serve as a lesson or a warning to the young or to those passing through the area .
Nourlangie is located in an outlying formation of the Arnhem Land Escarpment . There are a number of shelters in this large outcrop linked by paths and stairways . The shelters contain several impressive paintings that deal with the Dreamtime . The stories connected to these artworks are known only to certain Aboriginal people and remain secret .
Anbangbang Billabong lies in the shadow of Nourlangie Rock and is home to a wide range of wildlife which would have sustained traditional Aboriginal people well .
Nanguluwur , a small art site near Nourlangie , has several rock art styles . These include hand stencils , dynamic figures in large head-dresses carrying spears and boomerangs , Namandi spirits and mythical figures , including Alkajko , a female spirit with four arms and horns . There is also an interesting example of â contact artâ showing a two-masted sailing ship with anchor chain and a dinghy trailing behind .
Humans have made major changes in the area during the 19th and 20th century . Introduction of water buffalo from Southeast Asia caused damage to the fragile floodplains and wetlands . Since then , buffalo have largely been removed from the area so the land is now recovering . Crocodile hunting which has been banned since 1972 made a huge impact on crocodile numbers . Since they have been protected , the crocodiles have recovered so successfully that some think there are now too many .
Mining has made changes to the landscape , but only one uranium mine -LRB- Ranger -RRB- remains . Mine operators are have to repair and replant the area when the mine closes . Some small scale logging took place in the early part of the 20th century , but little evidence of this remains . Tourism causes big changes to Kakadu National Park with hundreds of thousands of visitors arriving annually . Roads , tracks , signs , shelter , accommodation , telecommunications and other services must be provided to support this activity .
Fire is part of the landscape of Kakadu National Park . The Park has large areas of woodland and grassy plains that are subject to long periods of dry hot weather . The flora of the region has adapted to frequent fires . Fires in northern Australia are less threatening than in southern Australia as many of the trees are largely fire resistant while other plants simply grow back very quickly .
Controlled burning is practiced by the national park in consultation with traditional owners who have used fire as a land management tool for thousands of years . Fire is an important hunting tool for Aboriginal people using it to flush out prey . The other benefit is that once the fire has gone through an area the tender shoots of the fast regenerating grasses attract wallabies into a clearly defined area . Birds of prey such as Whistling Kites also rely on fire to flush out small animals and are usually found in large numbers circling a fire front . Other species such as white-throated grasswrens have declined because of too many fires . Aboriginal people understand that fire is necessary to â clean upâ the landscape and believe that many small fires are preferable to one large fire .
Kakadu National Park is a major tourist attraction in Australiaâ s north with more than 200,000 vistors a year . Kakaduâ s dramatic landscape , Aboriginal cultural significance and diverse and abundant wildlife are what visitors come to see . There are many beautiful waterfalls and gorges within the Park that are popular with visitors such as Maguk , Gunlom , Twin Falls and Jim Jim Falls .
Kakadu National Park has some of the best examples of Aboriginal rock art in Australia . The sites of Nourlangie and Ubirr are among the most visited locations in the Park . It is possible to view some of Kakaduâ s diverse wildlife at places like Yellow Water Billabong , Cooinda on board a wildlife cruise or at Mamukala Wetlands or Anbangbang Billabong . The Kakadu region is one of the worldâ s best for bird watching as about 30 % of Australiaâ s bird species can be seen here .
Large saltwater crocodiles are also common at Yellow Water and the East Alligator River . The Crocodile Dundee movies were made here . Visitors need to be careful around crocodiles as they have been responsible for a number of fatal attacks . Fishing is a popular activity inside Kakadu National Park . The main species is Barramundi and the most popular locations are Yellow Water , the South Alligator and the East Alligator River . Hunting is not allowed in Kakadu National Park .
There are several places to stay in the Park , mostly found in the town of Jabiru , as well as a range of services to cater to visitorâ s needs . Visitors can experience Kakadu National Park with a recognized tour operator or they can drive themselves . Many of the Parkâ s sites are can be reached by standard two wheel drive vehicles , but areas like Twin and Jim Jim Falls and Gunlom require four wheel drive vehicles . Visitors can experience Kakadu National Park via the Natureâ s Way tourism drive which is a loop from Darwin to Jabiru then onto Katherine and back to Darwin covering about 900km .
The Park is proclaimed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 -LRB- the EPBC Act -RRB- and is managed through a joint management arrangement between the Aboriginal traditional owners and the Director of National Parks . The Director manages Commonwealth national parks through Parks Australia , which is a part of the Department of the Environment and Water Resources . Title to Aboriginal land in the Park is held by Aboriginal land trusts . The land trusts have leased their land to the Director of National Parks for the purpose of a national park for the enjoyment and benefit of all Australians and international visitors . Traditional owners have also expected that having their land managed as a national park would assist them in looking after their land in the face of growing and competing pressures . They saw a national park as establishing a way to manage the land that could protect their interests and be sympathetic to their aspirations . Parks Australia and the Aboriginal traditional owners of Kakadu are committed to the principle of joint management of the Park and arrangements to help this happen are highlighted in Kakaduâ s Plan of Management .
The EPBC Act provides for boards of management to be established for parks on Aboriginal land . The Kakadu Board of Management , which has an Aboriginal majority -LRB- ten out of fifteen members -RRB- , representing the Aboriginal traditional owners of land in the Park , was established in 1989 . The Board determines policy for managing the Park and is responsible , along with the Director , for preparing plans of management for the Park . The Plan of Management is the main policy document for the Park and strives to balance strategic or long-term goals and tactical or day to day goals . Day to day management of Kakadu is carried out by people employed by Parks Australia , which is a branch of the Australian Governmentâ s Department of the Environment and Water Resources . Approximately one-third of the staff in Kakadu are Aboriginal people .
Kakadu National Park brought in an entry fee in April 2010 . Money raised will help manage the natural and cultural values of the park environment and improve visitor services .
Like many World Heritage sites around the world , including Yellowstone National Park , Serengeti National Park , Stonehenge , Pompeii and Herculaneum and the Pyramids of Giza - a park use fee will help maintain world-best management practices and facilities for the more than 200,000 visitors who experience Kakadu each year .
The $ 25 fee will apply to all interstate and international visitors aged 16 years and over . It can be used for 14 days . All Northern Territory residents and children under 16 have free entry .
Kakadu National Park is linked to Darwin by the Arnhem Highway and to Pine Creek and Katherine by the Kakadu Highway . Both roads are sealed all weather roads although may be cut off periodically during periods of heavy rain .
The town of Jabiru has several accommodation options , a service station , police , a medical clinic and a shopping center with a range of outlets . The town was built for the Uranium mine that was established prior to the founding of Kakadu National Park and provides infrastructure for the mineâ s workforce as well as the national park activities and tourism . Jabiru has a small airport from which scenic flights operate daily . There are no scheduled air services between Jabiru and Darwin however .
Other small tourism centres such as Cooinda and South Alligator provide limited facilities . Cooinda , 50km south of Jabiru on the Kakadu Highway is the site of Gagudju Lodge Cooinda , Yellow Water Cruises and the Warradjan Cultural Centre . Fuel and limited provisions are available at Cooinda and there is also a small airstrip for scenic flights . South Alligator approximately 40km west of Jabiru on the Arnhem Highway includes a hotel and service station . The Border Store near Ubirr Art Site and Cahills Crossing , 50km north of Jabiru , is a general store .
There are a wide variety of designated camping sites throughout the Park . Jabiru , Cooinda and South Alligator all have commercial camping areas and are in close proximity to most of the important natural attractions in these areas . Some of the Parkâ s campsites charge a nominal fee as these have shower and toilet facilities , others are free , however they have limited or no facilities . A list of the sites can be obtained from the Kakadu National Parkâ s Glenn Murcutt-designed Bowali Visitor Centre or from their website .
ISO 3166 is a standard made by the International Organization for Standardization -LRB- ISO -RRB- and it uses codes to name places into 3 letters .
History of India covers thousands of years . It covers many periods and dynasties . It may be divided in the following parts :
Some old fossils found in India indicate presence of living beings called Homo Erectus . Archeologists think that these beings were living in India between 200,000 to 500,000 years ago . This period is known as the paleolithic era . Human beings -LRB- Homo Sapiens -RRB- settled in the Indian subcontinent at least 12,000 years before . At that time the last Ice Age had just ended . First settlements of human beings in India are found in Bhimbetka , a place near Bhopal -LRB- Madya Pradesh , India -RRB- .
About 7000 years before , by 5100 BC , early Neolithic culture had developed in India . People had learned farming . They tended goats , lived in houses build of mud , and had learned to make baskets . Potteries were also made .
During the period 6000 BC and 2000 BC , late Neolithic culture and the beginning of the Bronze Age was taking shape in the Indus Valley of Ancient India .
Bronze Age was an important period of Indiaâ s prehistory . From this time onwards a solid base for more development came .
The Vedas are the oldest texts of India . There are four Vedas , and the first one is the Rigveda . The other three are Samveda , Yajurveda and Atharvaveda . The Vedas have verses in praise of gods and others . They also have other information . At that time , the society was pastoral . After the Rigveda , society became more agricultural . People became divided into four classes depending on the type of the work . Brahmins were priests and teachers . Khastriyas were the warriors . Vaishyas did agriculture , trading and commerce . The shudras were the general working class . This type of social division is called the Varna system in Hinduism .
During the period of the Vedic civilization , there were many Aryan clans and tribes . Some of them combined and became bigger like the kingdom of the Kurus .
Islam spread across the Indian subcontinent over a period of 500 years . In the 10th and 11th centuries , Turks and Afghans invaded India and established sultanates in Delhi . In the early 16th century , descendants of Genghis Khan swept across the Khyber Pass and established the Mughal -LRB- Mogul -RRB- Dynasty , which lasted for 200 years . From the 11th to the 15th centuries , southern India was dominated by Hindu Chola and Vijayanagar Dynasties . During this time , the two systems -- the prevailing Hindu and Muslim -- mingled , leaving lasting cultural influences on each other
Around the 5th century BC , north-western parts of India faced invasion by the Achaemenid Empire and the Greeks of Alexander 's army . Persian way of thinking , administration and lifestyle came to India . This influence became bigger during the Mauryan dynasty .
From around 520 BC , Achaemenid Empireâ s Darius I ruled large part of northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent . Then Alexander conquered these areas . Herodotus , a historian of that time has written that these areas were the richest areas of Alexanderâ s Empire . Achaemenid rule lasted about 186 years . In modern times , there are still traces of this Greek heritage to be found in parts of northwestern India .
Greco-Buddhism -LRB- also spelt as GrÃ co-Buddhism -RRB- is a combination of culture of Greece and Buddhism . This mixture of cultures continued to develop for 800 long years , from 4th century BC until the 5th century AD . The area where it happened is modern dayâ s Afghanistan and Pakistan . This mixture of cultures influenced Mahayana Buddhism and spread of Buddhism to China , Korea , and Japan .
Out of the sixteen Mahajanapadas noted above , kingdom of Magadha became most powerful . It had a big army . It started to rule other nearby kingdoms . Ashoka was the most famous ruler of the Magadha empire .
Many historians believe that the Shishunaga dynasty founded the Magadha empire in 684 BC . Rajgriha -LRB- presently in Bihar state , India -RRB- was their capital city . After some years , they changed the capital from Rajgriha to Pataliputra . Present day name of Pataliputra is Patna . Shishunaga dynasty ruled till 424 BC . Then Nanda dynasty came to power .
During this period , Buddhism and Jainism , two religions became important .
Nanda dynasty ruled India for about 100 years . Mahapadma Nanda of this dynasty died at the age of 88 . His rule lasted longest among other kings of this dynasty . The last king of this dynasty was Dhana Nanda .
In 321 BC , Chandragupta Maurya defeated Dhana Nanda . Chandragupta founded the Maurya dynasty . Under his rule , almost all parts of India become united under one single government . Chandragupta Maurya conquered large parts of nearby areas , At that time , Indian borders touched Persia and Central Asia . He also conquered Gandhara and made all several such areas part of India . His son Bindusara also conquered many nearby areas .
Bindusaraâ s son Ashoka continued to conquer more and more areas . But , when he saw so many dead persons in the Kalingaâ s war , he felt very bad . He became a Buddhist and stopped the policy of fighting and conquering new areas . He started to follow the path of Ahmisa . He sent persons to several parts of India and nearby countries like China and Sri Lanka to preach Buddhism . He also got messages engraved on rocks about Ahmisa . Ashoka is considered one of the best rulers the world has ever seen .
After about 50 years of Ashokaâ s death , Shunga dynasty came to power in 185 BC . Pusyamitra Sunga was the first king of this dynasty .
Kings of a dynasty named Kanva dynasty ruled the eastern parts of India from 71 BC to 26 BC . This dynasty was founded by Vasudeva , the first king of the Kanva dynasty . Vasudeva defeated the army of Shunga dynasty . In 30 BC , powerful forces from the southern parts of India defeated the army of Kanva dynasty . Now , power passed on to the Satavahanas .
The Satavahanas came to power from around 230 BC . They are also called Andhras . For about 450 years , many Satavahanas kings ruled most parts of the southern and central India . After that they became weak for various reasons . Major reasons for their weakness was fights among themselves and fighting with the Sakas .
For about 350 years , from the years 35-405 , Saka kings ruled India . They ruled the western and central parts of India . Now-a-days , these areas are parts of the present dayâ s Indian states of Gujarat , Maharashtra , Rajasthan , and Madhya Pradesh . There were 27 such independent rulers . Collectively they are called the Kshatrapas .
Saka kings ruled India along aside the Kushan kings and the Satvahana kings . Kushan kings ruled the northern parts of India . Satvahana kings ruled the central and some of the southern parts of India .
Indo-Scythians came to India from Siberia passing through several places like Bactria , Sogdiana , Kashmir and Arachosia . Their coming to India continued from the 2nd century BC to the 1st century BC . They defeated the Indo-Greek rulers of India , and ruled India from Gandhara to Mathura .
The Gupta dynasty reigned from around 320 to 550 AD . The Gupta Empire covered most of North-central India , the region Gupta Empire -LRB- never included Pakistan -RRB- ; and what is now western India and Bangladesh . Gupta society was ordered in accordance with Hindu beliefs . The time of the Gupta Empire is seen as Golden Age of India . Historians place the Gupta dynasty alongside with the Han Dynasty , Tang Dynasty and Roman Empire as a model of a classical civilization .
By the first half of the fifth century , a group of people known as Huns has settled in Afghanistan . They became powerful . They made Bamiyan as their capital city . They started attacking northwestern parts of India . Skandagupta , an emperor of the Gupta dynasty could fight back and kept them away for some years . At last Huns could enter most parts of northern India . With this the Gupta dynasty came to an end . Most of north India became badly affected by this invasion . However , Huns could not go up to the Deccan and the southern parts of India . These parts remained peaceful . No one knows definitely about the fate of Huns after end of the sixth century . Some historians believe that they mixed up fully with the Indian people of that time .
In the history of India , Middle kingdoms of India covers a period beginning from around the 6th-7th century . In South India , Chola kings ruled Tamil Nadu , and Chera kings ruled Kerala . They also had trading relationships with the Roman Empire to the west and Southeast Asia to the east . In north India , Rajputs ruled in many kingdoms . Some of such kingdoms continued for hundreds of years .
After the collapse of the Gupta Empire , it was Harsha of Kanauj -LRB- a place now in Madhya Pradesh state of India -RRB- who united the northern parts of India in one kingdom . After his death several dynasties tried to control north India and ruled from time to time from 7th century till the 9th century as described in some of the sections below . Some of these dynasties were the Pratiharas of Malwa and later Kannauj ; the Palas of Bengal , and the Rashtrakutas of the Deccan .
The Pratihara kings ruled kingdoms in Rajasthan and some other parts of northern India from the 6th century to the 11th century . The Palas ruled the eastern part of India . They ruled over areas which are now parts of the Indian states of Bihar , Jharkhand , and the west Bengal , and of Bangladesh . The Palas ruled from 8th century to the 12th century . In the southern parts of India , Rashtrakutas of Malakheda -LRB- Karnataka -RRB- ruled the Deccan during the 8th-10th centuries after the end of Chalukya rule . All these three dynasties always tried to control the entire north India . During all this time lasting for three to four hundred years , the Chola kings were growing in power and influence .
In the 6th century several Rajput kingdoms came into being in Rajasthan . Many other Rajput kings ruled in different parts of north India . Some of these kingdoms continue to survive for hundreds of years during different periods of the history of India .
In 1336 , two brothers named Harihara and Bukka founded the Vijayanagara Empire in an area which is now in Karnataka state of India . The most famous king of this empire was Krishnadevaraya . In 1565 , rulers of this empire were defeated in a battle . But , the empire continued for about next one hundred years .
A number of kingdoms of south India had trading relations with the Arabs in the west , and with Indonesia and other countries of the east .
Slave dynasty was started by Qutub ud din Aibak . He was the one who started the first architectural monument of the slave dynasty or rather the first architectural work of Muslims in India which was Qutub Minar . Qutub ud din Aibak died while playing chaugan -LRB- modern day polo -RRB- as he fell from his horse . He was succeeded by Iltumish who completed the Qutub Minar . He was succeeded by his daughter Razia Sultan who became the first woman ruler . Though she reigned for three years but she introduced variious reforms in her tenure .
The Kingdom of Mysore was a kingdom of southern India . People known as Wodeyars founded this kingdom in the year 1400 . Later on , Hyder Ali and his son , Tipu Sultan , fought with the Wodeyar rulers . They also fought with the forces of the British Raj , but were defeated . Under the British Raj , Wodeyar kings continued to rule a large part of Karnataka . When India became independent on 15th August 1947 , Wodeyarsâ kingdom chose to become a part of India .
Guru Nanak founded Sikhism and his followers were called Sikhs . The power of Sikhs continued to increase in the northwestern part of India . The Sikhs became rulers of large part of the northwestern India . This is called the Sikh Empire . Ranjit Singh was the most famous ruler of the Sikh Empire . He expanded the borders of the Sikh Empire and at the time of his death , this empire covered areas of Punjab , and present day Kashmir and parts of Pakistan . The Sikhs and forces of the British Raj fought many wars . Till Maharaja Ranjit Singh was alive , Britishers were not able to cross the Sutlej river . After his death , the they took over the entire Punjab after battles with disorganised sikh troops .
For a short period , a person named Ahmed Shah Durrani ruled some parts of northwestern India . Historians have named his rule as the Durrani Empire . In 1748 , he crossed the Indus River and attacked Lahore , now a part of Pakistan . He also attacked many parts of Punjab . Then , he attacked Delhi . At that time , Delhi was the capital of the Mughal Empire . He took many valuable things from India . This included the famous diamond named Kohinoor .
Colonial period means the period during which Western countries ruled India . These countries also ruled many other countries of Asia , Africa , and South America .
Starting in the 1600 's the British East India Company began a very profitable trading empire in India , centered in Bengal . In the mid-1700 's Robert Clive -LRB- 1725-1774 -RRB- lead the Company to an expanded influence in India with victories over the French , the Bengalis , and the Mughals . With a victory at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 Clive became the first British Governor of Bengal .
In the hundred years after the battle , the East India Company conquered the entire subcontinent of India . They did this by trade , political intrigue , and direct military action . The British were very efficient administrators of their domains . But in 1857 the Indian Mutiny almost destroyed the Company 's rule of India . Afterward the British government took control away from the Company . In 1858 , India became a part of the British Empire and queen Victoria became the empress of India .
The British Raj For ninety years the British ruled India and Burma as a unified territory under the British king or queen . It was divided into eight provinces each with a governor . These provinces were Burma , Bengal , Madras , Bombay , UP , Central Provinces , Punjab , and Assam . A Governor-General -LRB- Viceroy -RRB- in Calcutta was head of the government .
The British did bad things . They took valuables , tortured and raped many Indians . The way they conquered India was often divide and rule . In the end , many kingdoms were defeated by the British and the riches taken . For example , many of the Royal Crown Jewels were taken from previous kingdoms in India - including the Koh-I-Noor diamond -LRB- one of the worlds largest diamonds -RRB- . Also , they stole many other large diamonds and gold .
During famines and floods many people died because the government did not help enough . Any Indian not able to pay the British taxes , could be forced into prison and\/or publicly beaten . Political opponents were jailed and sometimes killed for speaking out against colonial rule . After taking much of the India 's natural resources for hundreds of years , England was criticized for not protecting Indians during the partition of India and Pakistan . During the partition of India and Pakistan , millions of Indians and Pakistanisâ died .
The British also did good things . They built railroads , telegraphs and telephones , improved trade , standardized laws , and water supplies . Many of these things were done to help improve commerce in India and taxes provided to England . They created the Indian Civil Service for administering rules and regulations . They also tried to eliminate practices like burning widows .
The British ruled India primarily for the economic benefit of Britain . India produced cheap raw materials for British industry . Indians had to buy British manufactured goods and profits went back to Britain .
Many people in India wanted to be free from British rule . The struggle for independence was long and difficult . The most important leader of the struggle for Indian independence was Mohandas Gandhi . Gandhi believed in non-violent opposition to the British .
India won its independence , along with Muslim Pakistan , and became a free country on August 15 , 1947 .
On 15th August 1947 , British Indian Empire was partitioned into two countries , India -LRB- Hindustan -RRB- and Pakistan . With this the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent ended . On 26th January , 1950 , Hindustan adopted a constitution . From that day , Hindustanis became the Republic of India or Indians .
During last 60 years , Republic of India has seen different stages in its national life . Some of them are as follows :
Presently -LRB- 2006 -RRB- , India is currently the tenth largest economy in terms of gross GDP . It is the 4th largest economy of the world when accounting for purchasing power parity . Some economists think that in coming decades , Indiaâ s economy shall become still larger .
JosÃ Vicente SÃ nchez -LRB- born 8 October , 1956 -RRB- is a former Spanish football player . He has played for Spain national team .
The 1934 FIFA World Cup was a football -LRB- soccer -RRB- sporting event that was held in Italy in 1934 . Italy won the trophy after beating Czech in the final .
